Task 1
    Write a format string to take the tuple (2, 123.4567, 1000, 1234.67)
    and produce 'file_002 :  123.46, 1.00e+04, 1.23e+04'

Task 2
    Repeat Task 1 but this time use an alternate type of format string.
    consider using f-strings.

Task 3
    Rewrite, "the 3 numbers are: {:d}, {:d}, {:d}",format(1,2,3) to take
    arbitrary values - and an arbitrary number of values.  Allow it to be
    a string called by either a literal or by a name.

Task 4
    Given a (5) element tuple (4, 30, 2017, 2, 27) use string formatting
    to print '02 27 2017 04 30'

Task 5
    Given the list ['oranges', 1.3, 'lemons', 1.1]
    write an f-string that will display, "The weight of an orange is 1.3 and
    the weight of a lemon is 1.1"
    Now see if you can change the names to uppercase and make the weight 20% 
    higher for each.

Task 6
   Write a python code to print a table of several rows, each with a name
   and age, and a cost.  Make sure some of the costs are in the hudreds
   and thousands to test your alignment.
   
   And for an extra task, given a tuple with (10) consecutive numbers, 
   can you work how to quickly print the tuple in columns that are (5) 
   characters wide?  HINT: Make it a one-liner.
