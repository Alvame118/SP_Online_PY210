LESSON 4
---dict_lab.py---
An ungraded assignment playing with dictionary manipulation.

---Trigrams.py---
A file reading program that takes a text file specified by the user, parses it 
into individual words, which are then grouped into a dictionary in running groups
of (3) words (trigrams) of which the first two are a key, and the last a value 
for the dictionary.  This results in a dictionary of word pairs and a list of all
words known to follow each word pair.

The script then asks the user how many times the trigram dictionary shall be 
referenced and assembles a new conglomeration of words with approximately the same
word associations the author of the original file used.

This script includes a copy of Edgar Allan Poe's works free of charge.


---mailroom_s.py---
Similar to Lesson 3 except uses dictionaries to direct workflow more elegantly
and allows the user to output .txt files instead of simple terminal output.
