Program Part2:
Update your mailroom program to:

See if you can use a dict to switch between the userâ€™s selections.
See if you can use a dict to switch between the users selections. see Using a Dictionary to switch for what this means.
Convert your main donor data structure to be a dict.
Try to use a dict and the .format() method to produce the letter as one big template,
