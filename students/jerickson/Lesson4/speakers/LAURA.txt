 Okay so Im going to try to reroll one of
my three too
 Oh right Oh shit
 
 Okay So the best hand you can get is three
of a kind Then after that its a straight A
high straight Then a low straight Then its if
you get all evens or if you get all odds then
its two of a kind then its nothing its just
high card Okay but now we put in a second
amount because you can up the ante and you get
one more card
 No but wait wait wait You can put in
more money and then I deal you a different card
You get to give a card back and then I deal you
another card
 One more silver Okay Ill keep it low
too because youre only doing the one So I only
put in one silver too
 Yes And now give one of your dice back
whichever one you dont want and roll it again
 I dont want to reroll any Okay Now you
show what you got and well see who wins
 I got three fives

 Oh jeez now Im definitely giving you your
two silver back Dont worry about it man

 Have my baked goods come out yet
 I just want to go to the carnival
 Should we do it
 Weve done that It sucked so much
 Well by mistake
 Well I lost it but he made so much
 Do you guys want company Do you want us to
come and hang out with you today
 I can hear you
 Bottom line and I touch Notts shoulder
and I cast Blessing of the Trickster
 That would be the worst character choice
ever

 You have advantage on all your stealth
checks
 Because she is all kinds of trouble
 Whats her name The creepy doll
 No dont say that I dont want to see art
with you with Annabelles face
 Whats a Trost
 We just cant go by the Baumbauch ale
 Is that the one you need
 Oh Well Why do you need it
 You need a beer
 Ive got to say I miss those two people we
ran into at the carnival
 I dont have very much either
 Aw its like Ren Faire
 Thats Vax Thats Vaxs dice
 No I gave it back to you remember
 Is this a big shop
 While he was talking to the shopkeeper Im
going to take out as many books as I can and move
them around on the shelves and then take some of
them and turn them around to where their binding
is facing the inside
 Natural 
 I skip out the door
 And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you
again just in case
 We came
 Am I the only one going do we really have
to give up our weapons I dont feel okay with this
 Magic

 Heres the thing Some of us have weapons
that we dont want to pass away to other people
so how much of a chance is it that we could get
through without having to do that you know
 Right And we really want to see the show
But you know we are really good at security
like all of us are really strong and we could
fight things that came up too so maybe it would
be best if you dont take our weapons and then we
could help
 So do you want to hire us
 We could ask you for days off sometimes
 Like is his mustache especially BOy
Like what Thats really gross
 Ew I dont want to perceive this Im glad
I didnt roll very well
 Are you in the show too
 Just one dagger
 Pinkyswear me Yasha
 Yeah Now were best friends Heres my
sickle
 She has a really bad limp
 How are you carrying all of these weapons
 I think its just stealth checks with the
blessing
 Sorry I wish I wouldnt have said it and
then you could have had advantage just then but
Im not a cheater
 Are you keeping track of what goes with
what person Because its a lot
 Stop saying the word goblin People are
going to hear you
 Youre going to hang out with us the whole
night
 Of course you know theyre a lot to
handle
 Yes What are you telling me
 Oh yes
 If I skip around will I be part of the
show and then I dont have to pay
 Front and center
 As soon as I sit down Im going to pull
out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow
card that Molly showed me
 Oh theres no chairs Aw I was picturing
benches Thats okay
  Its like the serpent we fought
you guys
 This is really different than most
carnivals that Ive gone to
 Have we ever seen anything like this
before
 Well he just described what it looked
like
 I invoke Duplicity
 Oh yeah we were right in the fucking front
row Look at us Were so cute
 Yay
 
 Oh wait 
 Okay Well Im just going to go for it
all right Im going to cast Guiding Bolt on the
monster that just appeared
 Lets find out You make a ranged spell
attack
 Okay okay
 Well its cocked It was  and then it
rolled
 Thats  plus what do I add to my
Guiding Bolt plus five So 
 Yay d
 Ten   and then any attacks in the
future the next attack has advantage
 Yeah it was d radiant damage So yeah
it was  And then Im going to run the opposite
direction away from him but Im going to keep my
duplicate up there
 That backpacks almost as big as my dice
bag
 So shes going to stay here I cant reach
that far but Oh shit sorry
 Sorry I didnt realize it was
 Okay sounds good
 And you get advantage
 Isnt Chromatic Orb like a really strong
spell
 Can I shoot an arrow at Nott
 God somebodys going to get trampled
 I mean its a fire hazard for sure
 Oh shit Okay we have to keep them from
being dead
 Oh god
 Taking a stab
 Oh now Im worried Im worried about
the undead I dont know Well I dont think I
would know this so its okay Im going to say to
the air and say dude are you here because this
is like the coolest shit weve ever seen And then Im
going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie
creature guy And theres a bell that tolls
 He has to make a wisdom saving throw or
take d necrotic damage
 Oh three Thats lame
 And I made that sound like it was coming
from my duplicate and my duplicates going to run
back a little bit and stand next to the pole
Yeah
 Okay but roll again you have advantage
 Hi Caleb
 I like how every time you roll it comes
out
 Beau you got this
 Thats a really pretty dice
 There was a sick guy There was an old sick
guy and he turned into a zombie And I run over
and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau
 Are you sick too Did you get hurt Hold on
two seconds Im going to cure her and then Ill
cure you too
 Seven points thats all I could cure
 Oh thats better for you ten for you
 Can I search the corpse of the woman
 Which one
 When Im going which one I make my
second form just dart forward and start searching
the body
 Look at all the stuff that that ones
finding over there

 Can he turn and look and I try to search
the other guy
 Not bad 
 Did I find anything
 Shut up
 
 Your little dwarf girl was singing and she
turns people into zombies
  He does look suspicious
 I cast Thaumaturgy and make it sound like
theres a sound coming from behind him too
 Natural one
  There was some popcorn that I
ate earlier
  I have bloody fingers
 That was cocked unfortunately That was a
good one Oh well 
 Yasha will totally kill me Dont worry
you can leave
 
 Well we saw an old guy turn into a zombie
But its possible that he just died because he was
old and then he had the zombie curse on him and
just turned you know Because that happens a lot
 Shirley
 Shes really shy though and I hear she
only talks to tieflings so you should probably send
 my brother along because hes really good
with that stuff
 Next time we dont help Thats what it
comes down to
 We have to get Molly out
 I used some new dice
 Some new dice
 The innocent patrons you mean
 No lets go to the stockade
 Yeah
 I would have guessed that about you
 Ill follow Fjord
 She just walked out
 Is he a dude or is he a creature
 I dont have my dice jail out yet Its
okay hell chill there
 Oh this is so exciting
 To not drag any attention towards her you
are completely shoving her into the limelight
 Well technically he wasnt part of the
performance technically he was saving everyone
Technically
 Well technically we just all met
technically
 Were a group you guys

 Great I really like it here so thats good
that we get to stay so long
 Her accent is really strong Its hard to
not match her accent

 Theyre not with us
 Do you think it was the little girl
 What happened
 Oh I thought you didnt like jails
 So should we go in and try to get her out
 Okay
 Well follow her in
 She was also helping to save a lot of
people Big misunderstanding
 I know isnt it so weird
 It smells like Caleb down here

 I know why doesnt she get to talk to the
Lawmaster
 What do you mean
 Oh no are you guys making fun of her
because of her spasm
 Shes a very calm person Ive never seen
her angry ever
 It was an adopted sister
 I was helping
 Shes staying at the same place that we
are
 Do you need me to heal that
cause Do it for the cause
 Yeah The big zombie beast especially was
using a lot of like sticks and stuff to attack
people more than any kind of mouth

 Like at all during the day even Just a
question If we wanted to shop or something Not
okay
 Cool
 It is really beautiful here but I think
Id rather stay at the inn
 You should have spasmed a couple times on
the way here
 Yeah Opportunity missed
 Shes a dwarf Shes human
 Oh You didnt make that clear at all
 Why would you save her She turned those
people into zombies
 I mean she could have
 Oh hi Youre here
 So great Were stuck in a city that has
zombie issues thats all
 Ill go up and ask the tavern keeper
 Yeah Yorda
 Oh my gosh there was this big trouble at
the carnival did you go
 Somebody turned into a zombie and then
 Yeah And then were all under
investigation because we saved them These guards

 Wow thats a lot okay
 My mother said dont give away other things
for free
 What do you do with the things once you
steal them

 Right I understand that
 What language is it
 What does it mean
 Granted sparks of life Does that sound
like a familiar story that Ive heard before
 How did you and Kylre meet
 Man we suck at this
 Theyre new
 Oh Okay
 Anybody in weird cloaks
 Okay
 Lets go Weve got it weve solved the
case
 I thought we were stealthing over to the
main tent
 I wanted to get to the main tent to see if
I could sense any evil in the big main tent
 But if its really far away
 Oh god Please no one please no whammies
 Natural 
 Im sensing it
 No fucking evil
 Its Ornna
 We know you guys are in a fight all the
time
 You
 Why did you turn that guy into a zombie
 The first whisper
 Insight check on the
 Seven
 I think shes telling the truth
 I did get a very evil kind of vibe off
him
 Well I mean hes a fiend
 The devil toad guy Hes a fiend
 You guys know hes a fiend right
  Can we peek outside of the tent
and see whats going on
 Oh no We have to fight them
 Totally
 Thats right
 So we definitely cant fight that thing
 Oh my god
 Yeah he touched him didnt he
 I thought he did
 Hey bonus news though The charm spell
guy isnt going to turn me dead
 Whoa Tight tight tight tight
 I wanted to cough for her
 That was the third spell by the way
Detect Good and Evil
 No spells Ive got cantrips though so
dont worry guys
 Just the fried piece Not even an onion
left in there
 Oh Yours rolled a one too

 Oh no oh no
 You have three initiative Whats your
initiative
 No Im four
 One plus three
 Yeah theyre just sitting there
 They are fast moving zombies
 We should probably kill the zombies because
anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into
another zombie
 Now I just want to do Hamilton with all our
character voices
 Oh youre out there all by yourself
Beau
 I dont know whats happening
 Whats new at the table
 This is so cute Look at all
the little barrels
 Fifteen plus whatever
 Make up for our shortcomings Taliesin
 You cut like a little v cake with head
 Oh thats what rouges can do they can use
their bonus action to dash
 Oh okay Im going to sit down on the
ground and open the tent
 And look out
 Then I say
 Oh shit I shouldnt have used
all those spells earlier All I have is Sacred
Flame and Im going to do that Im going to
shoot Sacred Flame and at the same time Im going
 Yeah its a  dexterity
 That doesnt do any damage then
 It just says thats it
 Balls  Shit Frumpkin Lumpy come
here
 Sorry guys
 Is that a cantrip
 Renewed undead strength
 No dont leave me
 Two more swings
 Two more flourishes
 Renewed undead strength
 Kill it Nott
 With sneak attack you double your dice
 I come running out of the tent Say
 Molly
Oh shit oh no Okay I kneel down next to him and
Ill do Spare the Dying cantrip
 Yes It took someone going unconscious
guys
 Can I try and do some medicine on him Does
that heal him at all
 I dont think so
 I have doughnuts some paint supplies
 Im the cleric What is this Ive never
traveled with a bunch of people that I thought
would die in front of me okay I never needed a
healers kit before
  You have a healers kit Oh my
gosh Ive always wanted one of these for so
long
 Yes How do I use this though
 I open it and rummage through a bunch of
shit here
 Should I
 What if I roll a one on it
 A nine
 Yeah is any of their armor still usable
Because we can pretend were guards for some
reason
 Oh
 We should get out of here soon though
because guards could be coming
 It jumped off that way
 Yeah
 Theres probably more coming I would
think
 I dont know who should run where
 I have his head in my lap and Im slapping
his cheek consistently
 Ooh
 Ooh good we can put Molly on the back of
the wagon That way we can get him out of here
And the guards bodies too That way we can drop
them off away from the carnival and people wont
think its related
 Im a very wise person
 Okay
 Ill do it I go pick him up and carry
him
 Somebody needs to grab Molly Hes still
over there
 The one with the two horses attached yo
Can you see it
 Well take that one
 Unhook the other horse so we can steal that
one too
 Theyre outies
 Oh my god
 Dont worry Caleb Im okay
 Hes alive Youre awake
 How do you feel
 I saved your life You should be really
grateful
 Are you sure
 What are you going to say to them
 Dont say that we were here Dont mention
we were here Thats pretty important I think
Yeah
 Well get them out of it
 What happened to her Did it take Toya with
it
 We need to find evidence to exonerate us
 Lets go
 Are we really chasing the toad right now
Molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone
and hes almost dead right now
 We are going to rest right We cant just
chase after a toad Well die
 Fjord Im trusting you
 Okay
 Yeah its cute
 Yeah lets follow the direction that the
toad went
 I like it Its a good plan This is
definitely not going to backfire Lets go

 When we get far away from the carnival we
should drop the guard bodies off Push them out so
it looks like they were on patrol when they turned
into zombies Far away from the carnival
 Exactly Like a lake patrol
 Take them out of this wagon
 Or a giant toad sitting in the water
 Can they see us
 If we cant see them very clearly they
cant see us very clearly We dont have a light
on us
 Go up a little further away from the boat
and then dump the bodies
 Its not like were trying to hide the
bodies Were saying they turned into zombies
around here Is that stupid
 Oh coming from the carnival
 That would definitely work Will you add my
name to that list
 Like normal
 Maybe we dump the bodies and Ill get out
and try to make the tracks go away for a little
bit Ill walk up the path and do like this
 Yeah but the wagon will come from the
carnival straight to the bodies Isnt that weird
 Not that far
 I think we have to go back to the inn
right
 Yeah
 Oh okay
 Well
 All right Are we dumping these bodies or
what
 Yeah
 I get out and I start positioning them like
maybe they were having a romantic tryst
 Do you want us to
 Sure lets do that
 Oh shes all about shady shit She does a
lot of it
  Go to sleep little tiefling
 Theyre late night fishermen
 Can I look for toad tracks
 I didnt
 That was a whole lot of rolls Survival

 Fjord Come look at this This is
definitely toad tracks
 That lump is the toad
 So we head towards that boat that hit
land
 If we go towards the toad we are going to
fight the toad
 Because you used your blood on it
 I bet you have a thing where you can click
it on
 Thats what we figured
 Straight across
 It could have gone to the island
 Will you be able to keep tracking it After you sleep
 He was a fiend
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Its open  hours
 Yeah You should do that
 Lets go
 I dont think we would have taken the cart
past the fishermen Are we going to do that
 I dont think we would have gone right past
the fishermen that would be able to identify us
 The horse whimpers you hurt a horse
 You rolled shit too
 I use Thaumaturgy and I make the sound of
like a predator behind them
 Okay 
 Those ducks are scary
 Were being careful
 Im going to Does anybody have shitty stealth
 Well okay I was going to give anybody
advantage but here you go
 Wow that was bad
 
 We should go to sleep
 Do we reset our max hit points when we take
a long rest
 I fell asleep in my sketchbook halfway
through my drawing of the two zombie guards making out
 Theyre zombies so yeah
 One arm is like off to the side
 Is that our door
 Hold on Im naked
 Ill get it
 No I get up I get it Hello
 Did you come back to play some games
 Well you know we might want to brush our
teeth
 No Now we have time to
 Okay Ill see you soon I miss you
already
 Its two oclock in the afternoon you
said When we woke up
 I know its confusing when you speak
with the accent all the time
 Cool Why are you guys so happy
 Can I look at one of your books
 Is that a yes You said yes
 Im not afraid of dicks
 Can I look over his shoulder the whole time
hes reading it
 Yeah In a couple hours
 Thats right we were in this inn the whole
time
 We can definitely steal a boat
 He was a sailor Thats how I met him
 As soon as Caleb looks up I look in his
book What is your book about
  Those are my favorite
 Are there drawings of them
 He laughed at it the first  times I
said it to him
 What does it say
 That is what they look like They look like
husks
 You never noticed him eating people before
 Okay
  Thats what was happening to Toya
Maybe all of you
 Does it say anything about it hiding in
water
 Does it say anything about it liking the
sound of song
 Is it related at all to the periwinkles you
were talking about before
 Does it say how to kill it
 Well most fiends are weak to holy damage
right
 
 Reading
 Whats going on
 But we could help Obviously we had nothing to
do with it if people are hurt outside and we were
here the whole time
 How much did you say it costs though
 Octopuses are very smart
 I didnt say I was very smart
 Get ten gold worth of incense
 Youre going through gold very quickly
 I could help you
 Okay Ill put one in then you have only
eight
 Damn it Right here
 This is the lumpiest little bird Ive ever
seen
 I feel so special and blessed you guys
 Thank you
 Do we have to get in disguise again in
order to leave
 He cant communicate with us when hes like
this
 Can he feel if we touch him I poke him in
the forehead
 Oh okay
 Can he tell who did it
 Thats wonderful
 Well okay but he wont know now
 Im going to braid Calebs hair
 I know
 Like a few little braids because his hair
is not super long Maybe one here one here and
one down here
  Now we can spy on the people below
us
 Iron Thats not noticeable
 Oh man Ive been concentrating on
skinkydoodles all day
 Man All right
 Its fine
 No you keep it Im a very generous
person
 Did you have it fly down closer so you
could see better
 I guess we should go to the big island
 Should we wait until duskytime
 Okay Does anybody else want braids in the
amount of time we have to wait
 Of course I can totally do that
 I dont want to waste a spell this time
 Thats awesome
 They came separate
 I thought when we talked to them they said
that Toya came after Kylre They joined the circus
at separate times
 We gave them a hard what was it
 Yeah Good Cop I was the good cop
 Yeah and we got hard information from
them
 Yeah and I was like Dont worry she
wont hurt you
 Then they fessed up to everything
They were like Were a fiend and she was like
Im a little girl
 That was how it went
 Can they all tell fortunes like you
 No they didnt lie to us
 They told us the truth
 What if hes like one of those creatures
that lives on the bottom of the sea and shes not
actually even a person shes like this light
thing that dangles in front of
 Yeah
 I bless you
 Maybe you should go out the front and talk
to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window
 Im so scared of rolling right now
 Oh no
 No
 
 Dont make comments after 
he just was kind to us
 I have my hood up
 You should talk to people
 That was pretty cool Gramps
 Yes you can definitely trust me
 Can I pull Fjord aside while shes off
doing that
 Fjord that voice youre doing It almost
sounded like you actually did in Port Damali
 I mean I like that voice I like this
voice too though
 I like it You can keep doing it
 Wait are you still in bird mode
 Whats Crookedstone
 Oh so the big one is Crookedstone
 I mean that sounds like fun right
 Tell me more about this witch

 Im going to draw witches in my
sketchbook
 So it went well
 I choked on my spit as I wooed
 How tall was the lizard man Devil toad
 Okay
 We are going to have a picnic on the
island
 Nighttime beach party
 Wait what is it a deception 
 Here Ill help you Gramps On either
side
 Should I cast Good and Evil Detection

 I can do it
 What was the name of the creature again
 He blew it out
 I can cast it I just will lose a spell
slot
 Roll really good

 Okay
 Nott should be next to Caleb because he
cant see So Nott should be right next to Caleb
 Okay So we spread
 Do we smell any brimstone
 
 The veils are covered in flour

 Stop burping Yes you did
 You probably just breathed out hard
 Can we sneak around the hut

tree in front of me Next to Fjord
 No Matt did the second one Isnt that

 Then as me Im going to run away Can I
run behind a tree and crouch
 Im going to crouch behind it
 Thats my turn
 I feel like Beau will have far less
problems hurting children
 Shes got the strongest windpipe ever
 Dont you add something
 So smart
 Imps are the top of the round
 Jeez louise
 Noooo
  he can land right there
 Oh god
 
 Am I within hitting range

 Okay Do you want to do something first
 Okay Im going to with my duplicity self

 Right there Shes going to Guiding Bolt
straight in his face
 Yes
Balls Seven
 Skinkydoodie
did you get up on the roof like that Thats why
he saw you I am going to run to the tree
straight back
 It doesnt hit me 
 I got a shield bitches
 That was Fjords other job
 Punch her in the face
 Oh he is going to be so pissed
 What are the odds you think that Yashas on
this island and shes going to come save us all
 Do something cool
 You knocked me off the roof
 She didnt feel anything She doesnt have
actual nerves
 Oh no
 God  seven
 So  total
 And Ive got a thing right in front of me
so I cant
 You can go first this time
 Okay Im going to cast fuck Cure
Wounds on myself
 Yeah Oh thats good Nine points of
damage healed Okay Which is going to go away as
soon as I turn and run away from the imp towards
Fjord around the trees so that the frog guy
doesnt get an attack on me
 I guess yeah
 Im just running away saying
 Shit shit
shit
 I guess so
 Are you still alive
 Wouldnt that be funny if we killed the
thing and then died from the imps That would be
so funny
 Im going to turn and say
 Oh help me
Traveler Im going to cast Word of Radiance
 Which will hit both of the imps with d
radiant damage
 Its Word of Radiance Each creature of my
choice I can see must succeed on a constitution
saving throw
 Of 
 d radiant Six damage
 Yeah
 Yeah thats the one he cursed
 That was an action
 As a bonus can I I dont even have
a healing potion
 Im going to run over to oh shit the imp
is still over top of Fjord
 Im going to make my illusion jump down and
start charging at the imp over Fjord
 Oh no
 It doesnt say It just says for the
duration you can cast spells as though you were in
the illusions space
 I have advantage on attack rolls against
the creature if were both within five feet of
each other
 Both of them fucked you again
 Poor Molly His arms are getting so tired
swinging both those blades
 Do you want to attack the imp
 Okay then Im going to run over to Fjord
and cast Cure Wounds on him so he wakes up
 With five hit points
 Oh man I start dancing around in a circle
with my illusion We did it guys
 Oh yeah I want to go over and start
searching his body
 Investigation or perception
 
 Okay
 What This is awesome Here Fjord I found
a cloister of seamen for you
 Its a bag of stuff that I think you will
like I already removed all the fancy stuff from
it though
 Whoa I put all of the jewels on my
fingers
 Nott look at me
 Arent these pretty rocks
 On the bag
 Yes but first can I use a ritual spell
Does that work against Yeah I can do ritual spells
 Can I Detect Magic on it
 Hmm theyre just plain rings but theyre
very pretty
 We should bring her to the
 So that she can defend us So that she can
tell everyone that the fiend was bad
 You are a very powerful wizard
 Can I use my healing kit and help heal him
Does that work or does it just bring somebody
back to consciousness
 Oh really Okay cool
 I got nothing
 I can heal you in the morning
 We can rest for  minutes or an hour or
so
 I would just like to say that as were
resting there Im closing my eyes and keeping a
hand down close to Nott with my rings on my
fingers
 It was all the mucus on the ring
 Im so proud of you
 Good job Fjord
 Does anybody need any healing
 You need some
 Oh thats too bad because I dont have any
spells left
 Should we do something with this body
 I dont know if itll fit on the boat
Would it fit on the boat that we came out on
 The whole body
 Yeah I got a bunch of rings See
 Is Toya waking up at all
 Its probably best not to wake her up while
were carrying this head around
 Does he have hair What are we carrying him
by
 All right lets carry him
 Fjord I gave you the bag of skin Dont
forget you have that
 You have the bag of slimy skin
 Wheres Frumpkin
 Oh good
 Oh no
 Oh it looked like a one from this angle
Still pretty terrible
 You were rolling bad on this the last game
You need to stop rolling that one
 All right
 We told you we were having a party man
 I take off my cloak and I cover the head
with it
 No not Toya Over the head
 I feel so bad
 Maybe one more Or two more
 Ill pull three out
 Go charm him Fjord Youre very charming
 It wasnt Trust us
 We like to be unsung heroes You know like
superheroes with secret identities
 Yeah that helps people But if everyone
knows who we are itll be much harder to fight
all the crime
 Well try really hard to not let you see
us
 Well pretend we dont know you
 Shes a halfling
 Dont boat drunk
 How are we going to get this giant head to
the authorities
 Oh I got an idea Why dont you go get a
wagon as soon as we get to shore and well help
you load it onto the wagon and then you just take
it on in yourself
 They could make a lot of soup
 Well you know whatever
 You disappear quickly because if you get
drawn into that investigation it would be bad
 Oh
 What were the two guards that keep coming
to the tavern
 We wrote their names down
 Thats right
 No hes going to go to the police and
bring them to the head
 Have you ever heard him say nergaliid
 Did he teach you how to sing to affect
peoples minds
 Sorry for what Beau
 Really
 It was only because Kylre was trying to
kill us and she was afraid that you were helping him
 That went well I think
 She apologized for exactly what she did
 How many people are around the dock right
now
 You werent here
 Im just holding a bowling ball
 Can I lob the head up over the side of the
boat
 Oh no
 Eight
 All right I need help Its still covered
dont worry She cant see what were doing its
covered with my cloak
 By the way its a little tiny cloak Its
like a half cape so its like
 Its going to squish you
 Oh thats good
 Gustavs in jail still
 Some people are loyal
 Who is not very stealthy here
 Oh thats true youre sneaking back to the
carnival I give you a nice little blessing
 Thats not comforting Caleb
 You can hold my hand
 Im warm blooded
 Nott you were too
 Should I leave my cloak here over the head
sir good sir guard man
 Should I leave my cloak here or should I
take it with me
 Just make sure you bring it back home
 Its green
 Okay we stealth away
 You just get advantage
 Seven

 Is it still dark out
 Oh my god Has anybody seen my shoe that I
dropped earlier around here
 Eight
 Its not a shoe I drop a ring Wait did
we take a short rest when we were on the boat We
did It was a short rest on the boat
 Okay Im going to cast Invoke Duplicity
Behind the guard
 Please please please Natural 

 Oh God Oh she doesnt make a sound does
she
 I dont think she makes any noise
 But if she can cast through her then I can
imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch
 Well if shes behind one of the guards
then two of the other guards can see her
 Yeah My duplicate is going to jump up and
down and start flailing her arms and then run down
the alley around the building
 Oh come on
 Did you see that behind you
 Thats my ring I dropped it out the
window
 I like to wear them on my toes
 Oh please dont Really we just left the
building because we wanted to go
 This is the stupidest thing
 Its actually true she wasnt with us
 Oh thats just mean
 Oh goddamn
 I keep doing this so I can make a jingling
sound with my chains
 You know the only reason we were out of
the inn is because we were looking for you Caleb
We didnt know where you went
 Who is it
 Oh no What are you going to do
 Not to get too close
 Fiend creatures specifically
 Oh well technically it was Caleb
technically

 Careful Fjord we havent been healed yet

could make a bunch of dresses Or
 Yeah
 Yeah right Its really pretty fabric
  A hot air balloon
 Havent you seen airships

 She couldve been in on it and just got
right away with it
 Shes good

start running around and just moving everything on
the shelves again the same way as before

map You did a really good job drawing it
 Wherever we go Im going to bury my head
in the map and walk behind everybody like a total

day

potions
 Okay hold on I open up my pack and I pour

my pouch and leave
 No
 You dont smell bad what did you do

health potion dont spend as much as he says
because apparently he was lying

that was wrapped around the map and tie it around
one of my horns

and see if theres anything cool there or what
city was it that the academy was in
 I mean the ultimate goal you guys is to
get to Hupperdook but
 Thats an afterthought
 Well we have to pass through Felderwin and
the Felderwin Village first
 Oh is that the one you dont like Okay
then well go up through Alfield and then Zadash
and then well cut across and go to Hupperdook
 How long of a travel would it be to get to
Zadash from where we are now

 Dashydash
 Okie dokie Im going to send my duplicate
out against the wall on this house
 Yeah Against that wall She can go up to
 feet And Im going to run across
 Yeah can I get against the wall further
in Yeah right there thats good
 Oh yeah Im going to use my bonus
action
 As Im running can I use my spiritual
weapon and
 I think its  feet Lets see  feet
Youre right Im sorry  feet
 Towards the giant guy and hit him
 Hit him with the rock 
 Boo
 For my action can I still see my duplicate
around the corner right there
 She is going to cast
 Okay She is going to use the cantrip
Sacred Flame
 Against the same big guy
 Yes basically yes thats what I did
Technically I did this before I moved
 Good He has to beat  It hits him
 Yes it does Four
 Well thats one method to be able to
reach
 Thats the Grog one
 I like that youre facing the wall so it
looks like
 Im going to point out Ive been doing
it wrong because I was thinking of my duplicate as
like Trinket was which had movement the same as
me and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate
which I did not realize Im going to stop doing
that
 Yeah I just looked it up and Im sorry
 Oh Thats real me
 This makes my duplicate way less fun if I
cant move her
 Thats my spiritual weapon
  feet
 Yeah at least shes directing fire
 Isnt she harder to hit because shes so
little
 Or you drop it because hes prone and Molly
will get super advantage on hitting him
 Shes so wanted
  And a miss and a miss
 Yeah right
 Yay Im going to run away from this guy
thats next to me Im going to run out into the
alley so I can see people
 Yeah
 Can I use a reaction on that
 Im going to say I am rubber and you are
glue and use Hellish Rebuke on him In Infernal
 Okay
 Maybe Hold on
 Im applying my changes to my health
 This is so much
 Oh d Okay Nine
 Ooh chilly
 I know and my bonus action
 So for my bonus action Im going to send
my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit
him At the same time Im going to cast What am
I going to cast Radiant No Guiding Bolt
 With you know Im going to do a little
flourish like pink energy comes out
 Okay Spell attack Ooh thats good
Thats a  plus five
 Okay
 Yes yes yes
 You didnt touch these ones
 Six eight nine radiant
 Thats radiant damage and then the
Spiritual Weapon
 Oh good Then the Spiritual Weapon will
have advantage Great
 Oh good So thats 
 Wheres my eight Six plus three is nine
 Oh Im going to use the rest of my
movement to run over and try to get behind this wall
 Thatll work I was going to go to the
brick wall
 Yeah sure why not
 You can do that
 Ugh
 We got to get the cart
 That means we almost killed him thats
what that means We almost had him
 Yeah
 Have we killed any of the gnollsgnolls
 What about the guards
 Arent they going to attack this skeleton
one thats right here next to both of us
 Yes I had I did the Hellish Rebuke to it
 I am so surprised I fall off the wall
 Okay Are either of those two gnolls over
there damaged
 Okay well Im going to use my giant
lollipop and its going to swing and hit a couple
times and try to hit one like a bat
 Okay this is the one you licked
 Eight
 Sams spit
 not a good luck charm
 Shit Im going to cast Cure Wounds on
myself and then Im going to leap off the wall
with great flourish and land next to Caleb Okay
thats a good idea Im going to land next to the
guard Then Im going to skip away to the
building
 Kill him
 But at least its not a critical attack
 What did you do
 Yeah
 But we didnt get to go because Nott just
jumped it
 Basically
 I was going to have my duplicate go over
and touch the guy laughing on the ground and cast
Inflict Wounds
 Natural 
 Five six  
 Yeah Thats why its more fun if I can move
her
 Thats all happening right now
 I run up and Ill cast Cure Wounds on
Molly Then Im going to run over and do the same
thing at level two to Nott Thats six points of
healing for you Im sorry
 Ill run up and cast it on Nott Oh no Nott
I pull her up into my lap Oh thats good 
oh  plus five No plus three
 Of course I say as I cut off the ears of
some of the gnolls
 These people have lost everything
 Thats okay because we got two ears
off of all the other ones
 Im also going pull off a chunk of tail and
see if it will pass
 Did you notice they had some undead
gnolls with them
 Have you ever seen anything like that
 Do they eat the bodies
 Too much meat What are they feeding
 Oh Or that
  WC I get up and I run and see if
our horse is still there
 Thanks man Thumbs up to the family Ill
run back to the group
 No Im going to leave it out there
 Yeah theyre petting him
  gold
 If we do thats  gold apiece Thats
Laura talking

 I can help them in the morning

 The broad
 Are they doubles Fulls Queens Twins
 Worst roommate ever
  gold Caleb
 For all the work that Beau did

 Thats why I wrote Broad Barn down
 What do you guys want to do today
 I liked it
 Do they need to feed
 What gods were you being sacrificed to
 Was it just your parents and you that were
being sacrificed
 Did they want to kill you or just take your
blood
 Oh So it wasnt so bad they just slowly
drained you
 Does it have to be your blood
 No dreams at all
 We can steal some things
 I thought we already got paid
 Lets keep helping
 We could stay here forever and just kill
gnolls
 But think about how good we would get over
time
 Mmhmm
 When did we agree that
 Did we agree to that
 Usually when you agree to something you
have to say it out loud Most of the time Unless
its like We just agreed to it You said it
you said it
 I cant tell its a secret Oh But shes
serious about it I can tell
 Do you want a donut this morning Its a
little more stale in the bag I have to let you know
 Do you want one
 Wait When did we say we were going to meet
Bryce
 I thought they were leaving
 In front of Broad Barn
 What if its a street We didnt clarify
did we
 I bet we can ask the guy downstairs
 Do you want some help Ill come help you
 After weve cooked Im going to switch out
his salt for his sugar
 
 After we cooked
 Sure
 Youre a halfling too so maybe you should
talk to him
 Oh this was your place
 Oh wow
 Oh no
 How much gold do you need
 I just had that too Im sorry I dont
have it anymore But I could try writing to my mom
to see if shell help you
 I love him so much
 Shrimp scampi Butterfly shrimp
 Fried shrimp
 Oh Its a store
 I bet its big
 Wow this is a really good talk that weve
had
 I think Im going to go look for the Broad
Barn
 Maybe well find all of those thousands of
gold for you and you can build your shop back up
 Were really tough We have no fear
 I will
 Here Its a moldy donut Be well
child the Traveler is with you
 You know my name I leave
 Dick
 Were going to kill all of them
 Syphilis can come with legs
 I feel their pain
 Specifically their heads too
 I bet we can find some ghosts
 Do you know where they are So we know how
to steer clear
 Ooh
 That would be why some of them have chunks
missing out of them
 Fire hydrant
 Well get this stuff and head right out
 Was it hit at all Was the store that were
going into destroyed at all
 Have fun dealing with the dick
 Did I recognize Starosta Kosh Did he seem
like the type that would have made a little side
trip down to because he seems like the type
 Intelligence 
 Good to know
 Wait wait How much incense do you need
 On incense And that five sticks was five
silvers worth
 That is a lot of incense to burn
 Do you have any pickles
 You seem like the type of place that would
carry pickles
 They come in barrels usually You get
barrels of pickles
 Is it poop in a jar Or is it pickles
 Thats true
 That is a good deal sir and I will give
you the copper
 No hold on No Ive got copper around
somewhere
 Okay Here I pick some lint off one of the
coppers that I have
 But she would know if you were swindling
 Youre such a dick
 But its usually poison you put
 Oh can you throw a med kit in there
with it if you have any left
 You have things going on
 Its fine
 No its okay I have this pickle
 I havent tried it I just drank the juice
but he ate it
 Are we prepared now to go
 We didnt ask Bryce for any healing
potions
 I mean there are people getting chopped up
and eaten But if you really want a cat
 We might be able to go faster
 You didnt die Nott I saved you
 Im think in the middle of a field yes So
that its
 Yeah
 So it seems like less of a trap
 And if we dont see one then Fjord youre
the biggest
 And bring people back
 But then how do we get all of the ears
 Were going to ask Bryce if they have a
horse to spare
 You need a tart
 Oh well why didnt you say something
Hold on let me dig
 Theres this one
 Hold on I think theres a blackberry one
somewhere in here
 Its kind of gross Im sorry
 I cant tell anymore Its all black
Sorry
 Should we go to the stables then
 Probably We definitely wont use it as
bait for the gnolls Okay bye
 I bet they left a lot of tracks and
probably some cart things
 They probably did Oh my god They werent
wearing any underwear were they
 But did it have holes for their butts
 Im keeping an eye out for poop
  Oh no
 Its a one
 If were sitting in the cart is the grass
taller than us or is it way lower than us
 If I stand up in the cart as we go can I
see out into the grass
 
 Im flying Im flying Jack
  Theres carts I see the carts I
jump up and down in her hands
 Oh are there people in the carts Can I
see
 Theyre empty
 Maybe
 Should we pull the cart over and sneak up
 Okay Lets pull the cart over and hide it
in the grass
 Oh but our horses What if they get
eaten
 But how are we going to get all the people
back if we dont have horses to pull the cart
 I heard a groan
 Im going to does anybody have to
sneeze
 Anybody feel like they need to
 Because Bless you I give you Blessing of
the Trickster
 You have advantage on stealth
 Were hiding it in the tall grass
 What was our loose plan We didnt see any
of them
 But we wont be able to pull the cart Im
really strong but I dont know if I can carry
that many people
 I am really strong though
 Thats not normally how you test strength
 Towards the three carts
 Me
 
 I get some grass and I put it on the cart
 Yeah do it do it
 Ten minutes Okay
 But what is the order of the line
 Ten
  We should kill them
 Sure
 Yeah Im going to hide
 I use Sacred Flame on the one next it
 It just has to make a dex save of over 
 Yay Then he gets four more damage
radiant
 You need to not use that dice for the rest
of the night
 Everybody but Beau you were missing like
crazy on that one
 Hey look We can use this hyena meat as
bait
 Toss them into the grass then to get them
out of view
 Okay Ill pick them up and throw them as
far as I can into the grass
 Thank you Hey what happened to the little
bunny though Im going to look for the little
white rabbit
 Thats really sad they ate it
 It looks like how we put the stuff over the
cart
 Thats way smarter that what we did
 It could fit in a backpack Maybe roll up
 Throw it on the cart as were leaving
 Like in Skyrim just wheels of cheese All
the cheese
 Well but what if it alerts a lot of the
gnolls and then we dont have the element of
surprise at all anymore
 It doesnt look that bad to me
 What does that mean
 Is that where the Brave comes from
 Oh my god this is awesome
 Yeah you wont be able to see anything
through it
 Its like those birds that hit our windows
at home
 Im gonna bless you before you go So you
can be sneakier
 Are we going in
 Oh okay
 Just tickle his balls
 Oh no you didnt see that
 Good Phew
 Are you stealthed
 Guiding Bolt on the one closest to me
 
 Six nine ten
 Ten points
 Oh wow I understood that It was scary
 Oh yeah thats the thing
 It stays up super good
  I cut off the ears
 Our pickle jar
 Ooh what are all these bags in here
 Yeah
 I didnt even react to it he had to point
it out
 Do I get advantage because theyre
helping
 That is not as good Investigation 
 We should write this stuff down
 Is it metal did you say
 With wax
 Well I have it Then the water
 A water jug and an ale jug
 Oh so I cant carry that with me Theyre
big
 Its hooded so you can close off the
light
 Yeah I found a small rod and a crowbar and
a sledgehammer
 Is it heavy
 Oh shit
 Give me my pencil though No
 Can I put the sledgehammer on my back
 My shield
 Oh can you do that
 I can look for them
 Well what did that one look like that you got
hit with before
 Maybe look for ropes crossing the ground
 Which one are we going down though Theres
two entrances arent there
 You should actually stealth though this
time okay
 You have a blessing
 With advantage
 I was going to say left I knew
 Do either of the two paths have more tracks
coming in and out of them
 Lets go down the right one
 No
 I agree
 Unless they want us to think its the path
that theyve trapped
 Thats right and its actually the path
that is least resistance
 Were stealthing
 We were stealthing we were stealthing
 Okay
 Yeah I can see in the dark Ill look
 
 No he has advantage now sorry
 
 Oh no
  Should we stop this
 Should we kill them all
 The big mama jama
 While thats happening Im going to cast
very quietly Cure Wounds on Nott next to me
because I saw youre bleeding yo
 You just regained nine hit points
 Yay
 Yeah Lets kill them
 But theyre little
 The hyenas are little
 Oh ones an archer twos an archer
threes an archer
 Shit fours an archer
 Oh Wouldnt that be really loud Wouldnt
that draw them back though
 It might bring the whole thing down on us
 Yeah definitely
 I feel like we should do that when were
leaving We shouldnt do that before we go in
Because were not going to be able to get to
anything
 Well yeah but this is very loud It would
draw things up here
 We can try attacking them and if it gets
bad then we use the TNT
 No TNT
 Get a surprise round
 We can get a surprise round on all of
them
 No you still have Blessing
 While hes doing it Im getting ready Im
doing this Im going to cast Mirror Image of myself
 Mirror Image
 Suddenly there are three mes around
myself
 Are you casting Blur or Mirror Image
 I want to know for my own sake
 I cast Spiritual Weapon above the two
gnolls directly in front of me
 Range on that is  feet
 Yeah right there Its going to giant
lollipop down and smack one of them in the face
 This one The one on your left
 Ooh  plus whatever
 That is nine force damage and thats my
bonus
 Then I can do a cantrip For my action Im
going to cast Sacred Flame at the same dude
 He saves so is it half or
 Yes Must succeed so it probably doesnt
do anything
 Can I run down the steps and hide behind
a barrel like its going to make any fucking
difference at all
 No I aimed at the other one
 Nah youre fine
 That is so sad
 
 Hyneas
 He looks so stupid
 Did you go Beau
 Do you want my dice bag
 Okay Have any of them been hurt yet
 Okay Im going to move my Spiritual Weapon
over to the one on the ground directly in front
of Beau Oh I meant on the lower level Yeah and
its going to hit him Whoa  plus five
 Thats nine points of force damage
 And then Im going to use Toll The Dead on
the one in front of Beau
 He has to roll a wisdom saving throw
  feet
 Yeah So he takes d necrotic damage
Two Its a little bell this time
 Im picturing the flat kind so it can
whack
 Im going to stay right there
 And then I make my mirror images be like
I guess theyre doing that because Im doing that
because theyre my mirror images
 Oh jeez theres a lot of them Thats a
bigger one it looks like
 That is the coolest spell ever
 Couldnt you have attacked with your
offhand first
 Oh man Caleb so rough tonight
 I say Dont laugh at my friend and Im
going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face
 I dont know if its going to hit it Eight
plus five
 Toll the Dead
 Yay Okay seven
 Its pretty cool
 Im going to hang out where I am
 We got to get that last gnoll before he
leaves the room
 Im glad we still get shitty jokes
 Oh so it cant get up and move
 I like that your revenge hits are always
really high Thats twice now that theyve
laughed at you and youve hit them while theyre
laughing at you
 Im going to skip over across the upper
level towards the far stairs so I can see it Im
going to send my Spiritual Weapon over to it and
smack it flat on the ground
 Jesus Christ I dont think either of them
hit  and lower
 Then Im going to Toll the Dead Wisdom
 Jesus fucking Christ

 Im going to sit down on the ground and
all my Mirror Images do the exact same thing
 Youre terrible
 I go around and I collect the gnoll ears
and I put them in the jar
 I have a question How similar do hyena
ears look to gnoll ears
 What if we said they were baby gnolls Im
going to cut them off just to be safe
 Whoa
 I need them I could probably use those
 Can I look at them since Im proficient in
medicine
 Oh sorry I was writing down gnoll sets of
ears
 Its an action you said
 What was the question Im sorry
 Oh sure Yeah Ill cast Cure Wounds on
him
 Yeah Yeenoghu
 Yeenogru or Yeenoghu
 He did say to bring back anything we could
find
 We could do it now As we move forward
 Jesus
 Im pretty much out of spells now But
thats okay
 What do you mean
 Yeah
 Oh I dont know Its a big weapon
 Yeah Ive got a scythe A sickle
 Lets set them up like they all were making
out
 Yeah yeah
 Loosely prop them up like that
 Did you do the
 Yeah
 Okay
 Lets go and be really smart and do this
 Oh no This is what happens when we sit
down and we talk
 Were moving forward as quickly as
possible
 Thats one way to get your players to move
Theres babies dying
 I like that our pickle jar is getting
filled with little
 Im smushing them down so that theres
like
 Well we drank all the pickle juice out of
it so really they just kind of have a pickle stink
 Well I was saving them but then
fucking Fjord asked for healing
 Thats what I was using cantrips
 Yay
 Because the shaft curves to the right
yall
 Only you

 Oh no If this is like a running thing this
whole campaign
 Look at that opening its so cool
looking
 Oh thats a little door Thats the door

 Roll again for advantage you might get a

 Did you find it

 I lied I am not going to do the Sacred
Flame Im going to do Toll the Dead because

 Ive got to see this dice as you roll it
 You werent even rolling those dice

 Now its a horror movie
 I was trying to help
 Thats great
 Oh Okay Im going to move forward into
the room To about yeah theres good sure Im

 Yes Then Im going to cast Toll the Dead
at him
 Fucking A piece of shit
 Its  because Im lame
 Im going to start unsnapping my sickle to
get it out to hit things
 Oh no
 Will the hyena get a bite on the kid
 Children have no hit points
  Hyenas will bite them
 Yes
 Okay Did I see the child go down
 Okay Then I am going to run over to the
kid
 No all these other people are helping this
kid so I guess I will too Somebody better kill
that big gnoll though
 I dont
 I dont care but now I feel guilty
 Should I use my last spell on this kid
 Im going to use a healers kit to
stabilize him
 The whole time Im grumbling like
 Oh I
could have gotten that last Toll of the Dead It
would have heard a really good bell and instead
Im doing this

 Oh no
 Oh my god Caleb needs glasses
 A new prescription
 Glasses make you smarter
 Your scarf will protect you
 Oh no I should have Tolled the Dead on
him
 Someone bring me those ears and bring them
to my jar
 How many gnolls was that we just killed
 We only sent one down the hole
 Right and then one hyena set
we deal with the kid for a minute
 Do you see what Im doing
 Oh I saw your bird
Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna They call her Stacy
but thats not her name
  The Grand Duchess
shes angry
 Can you heal Do you have healing Because
Im stabilizing him dont worry but
 And some doughnuts
 I take one and push it onto his face
 Were working on it
 On a scale from one to ten
him striking
 What are you wearing
tangle of brown and red and green that pretty much
cover him from his neck to his calf where his
boots start to take over Theres a hood that hes
wearing deep green It goes down to his legs and
a big enough hood thats able to cover his ample
locks
 Its a poop hole
 Hes probably covered in really old poop
 Shaft
putting it That boom you may have heard happened
to come from me so weve got a little bit less to
have to deal with This I really dont know
whats going on
 Oh speaking of I stand up and I 
walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from
 Are there any ropes across the door
 I knock on the door Housekeeping Is
anybody locked in here
 I think its the mom
 Okay 
 Yes Definitely
 Hes alive dont worry
 Are there any other people that are alive

the pockets
 Im dragging the bodies going Duchess
Duchess Stacy please come over to me Duchess
Stacy
 Grand Duchess Stacy
 Two
 I stabilized him I stabilized him real
good
 Ooh I could give someone a blessing whos
shitty at this Blessing
 With advantage
 Fuck
 Oh Jesus
 Oh thats where you came from
 Keep checking for traps okay
 Oh the Grand Duchess and Frumpkin will be
best of friends
 I feel like were seeing more of Calebs
social awkwardness seeing him from the outside
its so good
 Its really smart that he made a 
hummingbird Thats really fast
 Its a pretty smart move dont you think
 Yeah I mean its really smart
 Did you see any survivors
they are guarding something Im hoping thats
someone
 Maybe hes sleeping
 Offer her shiny things
turning out I feel like you can get all kinds of
gold and silver
 Then I give you a Blessing of the Trickster
for your stealth
 You get advantage Fjord
 We cant hear you youre fucking  feet
ahead of us
 Should we go down the tunnel
 Or should we go to them
 Then it would add another hour up there
wouldnt it
 I dont really get anything back on short
rest
 I mean there might be more survivors
 We rescued some survivors
 We took a rest

 You can do it
 I go running past them right as they do it
and cut its ears off
 Thank you
 Oh okay I do that
 
 Do they see us
 
  Theres a lot more guys out
there
 I saw three visually
 Oh god this means that
 That would be amazing
 Oh no Theyre coming  They
were about to look in this direction but they
werent quite looking in that direction when we
dragged the body out
 Fjord what do we do
 Can you send the Grand Duchess in
 Did she used to be a person and you shrunk
her down
you
 Oh no
 You can shake the ground though
he thinks he can aim takes him off kilter
 He saw the bird come back this way so
maybe
 Do you know how to do that
weve done before

 Lets fucking go
 I rub her head and give her a little
blessing Dont you worry You keep hiding
whenever you need it
 It gives you advantage on stealth checks
 Not surprised
its dark in there and one of them burst into
flames wouldnt they all look in that direction
 I could Sacred Flame him in the exact same
time
 I pull my sickle out so Im prepared for
actual upfront combat
 Which one do you want to hit The orange
one the gray one or the black one
 We cant see those guys to Sacred Flame
them
 We could get the one in the back and then
the other two might look at him
 Lets do it
 I knew it was Blur
 At the same time I see his little reed
flick Im going to swirl my sickle around and
cast Toll the Dead
 Its a dex save for Sacred Flame and a
wisdom save for Toll the Dead
 
 You couldnt have them roll that for me
 I really love Crystal Pepsi
 Ugh Thats okay It was for visual

 You can do it
 Oh god
 Drop his weapon no dont listen to me do

some dynamite get the people out and run
 We got two sticks

it
 Lets get it out and then collapse the
tunnel leading to it Then they can get stuck in
this room
 We have one and one
 We should make our way towards this

by the time we get to this room cause were 
feet away from it still
 Start walking
 Stealthily
 Who needs a blessing Caleb you need a
blessing
 Youre shitty at stealth right
 I bless you
 Oh theyre real close to them
 We get the guards out we get the people
out
 Oh were all going to be in there
 You need to sneak in and you need to try to
unhook the ropes okay
 You stealth around They wont even know
that youre there while were attacking Untie the
guards and then we all run
Thaumaturgy or Spiritual Weapon
 Spiritual Weapon is really good if you have
that thats very badass
 I know but then I have no spells left I
got a first level yall
got
 She should sneak in before you do Spiritual
Weapon otherwise its going to make them aware
that somethings going on The Spiritual Weapon will
definitely alert them to our presence
people a chance to run out of the place
 Yeah You make that Spiritual Weapon appear
right next to them You can hit them immediately
 You do it right when we do the surprise
attack You sneak in
 Yeah
 Are you good to sneak Im going to bless
you
 Before you go sneaking around the side
 You get advantage when you go into the
room just in case of a natural 
 
 Caleb whats your stealth roll
 Okay
 Come on Nott go
 All the way around
 Got nothing
 They might see you
 Youre getting really close to the
manticore
 Ill stand next to Caleb on the inside
 Yeah
 
 Im going to run around to the other side
of it This is so dumb
 Yeah
 Im going to hit it with my sickle or
whatever
 Natural one
 Oh no
 Im going to just dance in place
 Hits me
 Im going to cast Hellish Rebuke at it as
soon as it does it
 It doesnt say on my thing Its a dex
save

 Spiritual Weapon stays on the field Once

paralyzed
 Okay Im going to Sacred Flame the priest
 Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw
 Yeah
 Doesnt matter Still hit Six damage of
radiant
 Pink energy

can heal you
 Six plus two Eight
 Its all going to shit
 Thank you I stand up Ill reach out and
cast Cure Wounds on Nott
 Yes it is Sorry
 Eight points to heal
 Then I guess we should start running yes
I use the remainder of my
 Can I use my bonus action to dash
 My bonus action to whimper a little bit
 Im hoping the priest is lame
 Oh thats just mean
 Hideous Laughter Does that mean we all get
advantage on hits now
 But you guys Weve got a whole other
round
 For at least a whole round
 And each time he takes damage
 Oh I thought it was like a paralyzation
sort of thing
 Laugh it up Fuzzball
 What Whats this mean
 Thats right
just as sassy as she wants to be I do believe
that the underbelly of the manticore is still
waiting there for Estelle to tell him all kinds of
horrible things about what its like to live in
South Florida
 Nine plus five
 With advantage Why with advantage
 You got healing in there
 You could do a cantrip as an action
Because you got enough distance
him again with Sacred Flame
 Yeah d radiant
 Dont touch it I wonder if that makes
spells better 
 Yay Find all the shit
 This is so exciting
 Im going to walk up and pet the
manticores mantle
 What was that
 We should get out of here
wouldnt have made it we wouldnt have succeeded
without you so I say you earned that gold But
make no mistake be careful where you put your
fingers
 Should we get out of here I guess
 Anything else in the chamber Does it look
like theres any other little interesting things
in there
 Yeah
 Well Im still here with this big giant
manticore head so you guys got Caleb
 I think it might be easier to put it on the
cart
 I mean if its all slow then it doesnt
matter I can walk alongside it and pull the
manticore head
 We should probably just get there
 The saviors of Alfield have returned
 Its a manticore head
 Oh fuck
 Were still a
 I pull out the jar of ears

 Before I hand them over I open the lid and
shut it I think I did what he asked
 They heard it
 Hes the coolest
 Youre so epic
 Do you have a present
 Its so pretty
 It was up Wills butt
 I cant believe we survived
 Where did Shakste go
 Hes like the wind  Maybe he was the
Traveler
 The Traveler
 Well yeah mostly Yeah
 I mean he takes many forms
 Maybe Im the Traveler
 I mean yeah sure I worship him sure
Hes more like my best friend
 Probably
 How do you know what the Travelers like
Do you hang out with the Traveler too
 Oh right Well hes probably not the
Traveler then
 Have you ever killed someone before
 Im okay with that
 Oh yeah Who was it that had that stuff
 Can I have it
 I like rings
 Ooh
 What does it look like Is it like a
kaleidoscope
 I dont know what does it look like
 Do they fit over your
 Ooh then look at the ring that I want
 He totally just took the ring from
 Ooh do any of the rings that I have on my
fingers have a pearl on them
  You have a pearl
 Do you want me to carry it for you
 Lets do it
 I hope they have milk
 Im going to sit next to Caleb and watch it
all happen
 Dont you need to pull out your book so you
can look at your spells
 Oh
 This is true
 While hes doing everything hes doing Im
going try to very subtly draw a dick in his book
 Natural 
 Its our first item
 What is it Caleb
 You can stand on and move across any liquid
surface
 Where did that come from
 Probably It was probably Nott Wow this
ring is so cool
 What is it
 How fortunate
 What is it
 What is it
 Of course I do
 Yeah Im on the level
keeping this one
 No just tell me what it is Caleb
 You have to tell us

pickles then I probably wont try to steal it probably
 No Caleb

 A glaive
 Whoa
 Is it too dangerous for me to have
 What is a glaive
 Is it something that I could use
 Can I use a twohanded weapon Oh I have a
shield
 Yes
 I need to get a better weapon though you

it worth
 Okay
 Zadash

hands Can you shoot lightning from your hands

 I dont like Caleb looking at our shit
anymore He just looks at it and steals it
 
 This is so cute
 This is a great wand
 I point the wand at Nott
 
 I pull the mask down
 Oh my goodness Thats really creepy Nott
 How do I make it stop
 I think it lasts for a while
 Yes its a Wand of Smiles They have to
roll a DC of ten for charisma saving throw or be
forced to smile for a minute
 Thats the cutest fucking wand
 I love it
 Well find out Wheres oh Frumpkin
 Frumpkins gone
 Okay
 Oh Well you dont want to keep it You

 Look This ring is perfect for you That
way if we get near water you dont go in it
 Cheers to Caleb
 Thank you Fjord for saving my life
 Didnt you give me a potion
 I woke up and you were over me giving me a
potion like a knight in shining armor
 I probably would have Probably I did do
it for you though Nott
 I saved your life
 I hold the wand under the table at Calebs
leg and try to do it to him too
 Its charisma You had me do charisma
 You succeeded but you didnt even know I
tried

still my best friend and if you want me to be
alone I will be if that means that youll be here

 Oh jeez
 You stole an old blind mans food and
money
 The pearl pops out and flies across
the room never to be found again
 One ears up
 Hey what

flower superduper red I know because I tried to
make a paint out of one of the flowers one time and
it made me want to like seriously puke my guts
out And do the spins if you know what I mean
Super bad Thats bad
 That means it would be extra strong yeah
 Oh my gosh Well the Gentleman wants to
poison people Oh no the Baumbauchs yeah I
understand Wow do we need to tell someone about
this
 If we hear about an outbreak of people
vomiting
 Or about a ros
 Yeah
 In the coming week Thats soon When did
you steal this
 Oh my gosh what if we could intercept it
Then we could have all of the poison and the nips
 I like it
 Lets make a decision
 We just did it
 Oh man Im really hungry though Im going
to go downstairs
 These ears

 No it was  sets I marked down sets
Technically Matt Im not telling Bryce this five
of those sets are hyenas  of those are gnolls

 Before we leave can you tell me where
Starosta Koshs office is
 Oh we have some unfinished business
 All right
 Dermis is what I wrote down
 Yes Hi Starosta its so wonderful to see
you again
 Yes I was thinking a really good thing you
could do for us in return is to give my friend
Fjord here a letter of recommendation to the
Academy
 He did a great service to your city
 Starosta its good to see you again Its
been a while about hold on I get out my
sketchbook and I look through it Maybe like eight
years almost Your hair hasnt changed though you
should change it
 The Ruby of The Sea says hello
 Of course
 Make sure he spells it right Fjord
 He really should have changed his hair I
mean its pretty hideous
 Oh he visited my mother years ago
 Yes The Ruby of The Sea Youve heard of
her
 No
 Well shes mostly known for her
hmmhmmhmm Outside of that her voice is
amazing you should hear her sing
 What does what mean
 She has sex for money Mostly I mean
people pay her a large sum Its like three guys
mostly she keeps a few people at a time She
doesnt see everybody because shes super famous
 You would you really would
  The Ruby of the Sea is the best
lay ever
 Yeah
 Well I wouldnt know exactly because she
never told anybody that I was there I bet if she
had it wouldve been crazy
 You know in my room
 Well no I wasnt trapped but you know
 She read me some stories And a lot of
times I would listen at the door and hear her sing
 No
 Exactly I totally understand she loves me
so much She really really does Its just you
know people frown upon courtesans with daughters
 Mmhmm
 Yeah
 Yes Thats why Im such a good painter
 Oh no that came from the Traveler
 Well yes
 Well yes But I feel so nervous all of a
sudden everybodys looking at me
 Okay so they were totally in love and she
was going to marry him and he was totally in love
with her and he was going to marry her and they
said they were going to get married and then she
got pregnant with me and he said they got
married and he was going to go set up his house
and then he just never came back
 I know it is really sad
 No Im going to find him so that I have
somewhere to live because Im not allowed to be at
the house anymore
 Well because Im kind of in trouble in
Nicodranas
 Well because I sort of played a prank on
this guy who was seeing my mom
 Well so the Traveler taught me how to
make myself look like other people right
 So I made myself look like my mom and
then I lured him out onto our balcony and he was
wearing nothing but this girdle of hers And then
I locked the door And I thought that was funny
you know
 It looked really good in my sketchbook
 Yeah which is no big deal But then I
found out hes a lord
 He was really pissed off
 It was in the day
 Oh everyone
 It was so great But he said he wanted to
kill me and they said
 that was cool and he could So my mom was
like Go and I was like Okay
 Lord something something
 Lord Robert something something
 Ill remember it eventually
 I thought so too He looked really good
 I know right
 Well I mean
 I know right I mean Ive never met him
I thought it would be cool Thats who I was
looking for when I met Fjord over there
 I mean hes supposed to be pretty darn
cool He wears lots of rings on his fingers too

 Ooh No probably not
 You know what else we should do
 Did we get rooms

 We should look for Claudia
 Sheed
 Yeah
 Lets ask about
 We could ask
 Bryce from Alfield
 Yes I am We went up there I thought
 I was desanitizing him
 Shitty people
 No Im from youre from Port Damali
Im from Nicodranas
 Wait what
 Where are these shrines that you are
talking about
 Ooh we were just there
 That sounds good too
 Do the shrines usually have a lot of people
in them
 All of those guys Of course we knew about
those guys
 Oh well you know
 Okay
 Okay I wont tell anyone
 Well we have the Kings Hall board yo
Thats where the job postings are
 Go fuck yourself No
 Especially one if its furry and you can
pet it
 Was he perchance named The Gentleman
 Oh shit
 Do you know him
 Okay
 Thats the second verse
 Are they going to have an orgy
 Im asking that of Claudia
 Oh
 Im running to find Caleb
 Oh you have to look through his eyes
 I just wanted to borrow some parchment Do
you have any extra pieces of paper though
 I dont know Like  pieces
 A really long one
 I can make do with that yes Thank you
 Ive got you too
 I was spending my time cutting the
parchment up into even little rectangles so I
could make them into multiple pieces of paper
 I figured it was and Caleb was lying to us
the whole time
 Usually in orgies like that they dont
let you stay unless  Youre part of it
 Eww Nice
 So you did that to us
 Its a pretty big group Theres nine of
us
 Are there Ive only met one other person named
Beau
 I think his name was not the same Beau as
your Beau
 It was a different Beau Im going to start
folding my little pieces of paper into little trifolds
 Aww I want a bath so bad but its so
late Molly
 Is it even going to be open at night
 Okay I have important work to do
 Ill come with you too because I really
want a bath
 Its folded like this
 Oh thats really bad Its because Im
folding paper
 Four
 Damn it
 If the people look like you and Caleb they
probably need it
 Shitty people specifically
 I do I do get really mad
 I know
 Oh no It makes sense when youre in that
shirt
 Before I go to sleep Im going to use my
little folded papers and make little pamphlets to
the Traveler So its going to be like Have you
heard of our lord and savior the Traveler
 He sure is the coolest everyone should
worship him hes the best guy around
 Theyre like this little because I had to
make them out of only two sheets of
 Well however many I could make out of two
sheets of parchment so probably like eight or
maybe ten
 Beau You know what we need to do today
 We need to go to the pillow place and go
get some money from my mom
 Youre not with us in our room right now
 How does he do that
 Because I asked her for it
 Yes but its my mom and of course shes
going to send me money Youre crazy
 Its called the Pillow Trove We need to go
there But we need to look very pretty so before
that Im going to see if Molly wants to go get a
bath
 Yes we have to be fancy for that place
 We also need to go to the blacksmith you
guys As Im coming down the stairs We have so
many things to sell
 Good call
 Plus were good friends of Claudias
 And me and me and me
 They really are
 Because we might make so much money from
the blacksmith
 Whats a tabard
 Okay
 Aw man
 Yeah We could be famous
 Have you ever been famous
 You have no idea the kind of stuff that
is given to you when youre famous
 Want me to go tell him hes got it wrong
 Okay I chase after him
 I chased after him already
 Excuse me town crier man
 Where does your news come from
 Where is your boss located
 Because your boss at the Kings Hall has
some of his news his news is wrong Did you
know that the attack on Alfield was defeated by a
group called the Mighty Nein Theyre this really
amazing band of heroes
 Yes
 Yes it is its really cool Because we
were there and we saw it happen and it was really
cool and you should probably get your news
right
 Okay because by the time though that we
get there and then it gets back to you youve
probably been around town so much and then youll
have to retract your article and that would be
really weird
 Fjord
 What is this Is this a new accent youre
trying out
 Fjord you almost sound like Caleb
 Are you planning on sounding like Caleb
now
 What are you talking about Accents are
your strong suit Youre really good at it Fjord
 Yeah Wait can I tell its not actually
him
 Can I tell its not Fjord
 Thats the thing Can I tell from the
physicality Because you do accents
 Fjord you seem even weaker than you were
before pulling me along This is weird
  Caleb Is it really you
 Okay just let go of my ear now okay
 Hey man I was just doing what Fjord told
me to okay So dont you give me shit
 Oh my gosh This is perfect Because if
were called the Mighty Nein people will expect
it to be a different group of people
 Yeah Thats actually brilliant
 He always knows what were up to because he
has his cat follow us
 You killed its baby
 Yeah
 Ill lead the way
 Thin as a wet toilet paper
 I take my pink bag and I put it down on the
table in front of him
 Hi We have things to buy and sell from
you
 I pull out Well it depends do you have a
hand axe that I could buy
 Hand axe Something that is very sharp and
can kill people
 Okay put those on the table and then we
will look at some other stuff first Okay I have
six short swords and I put them down on the
table Ive got two daggers here Ive got two
hand crossbows Two light crossbows and two heavy
crossbows
 Maybe scrap metal is a good thing for this
 But also Also we have some other things
 I have them
 We put everything in the bag then it would
be good
 Then we fucking had them around our necks
 We knew we were going to the blacksmith
 And they were magic
 They had to be real good metal to be magic
 This giant lion thing with a womans head
had them around it and then we killed the lion
thing
 Do we want both of the axes or just the
one
 I need another weapon Just one of the axes
is all I need I dont need both
 Sound good for you guys
 I like it I think that is a very good
deal Whats your name sir
 Yannick Im Jester Its nice to meet you
 Specifically one thats melting
 Yeah
 The bath
 Shes really scary
 I follow behind her and yell
 Town crier
has toilet paper stuck to her shoe

 Wait what did she just say
 We need to get a really big piece of
vegetable
 Front of the blouse
 No shes alone
 Ooh thats good
 Oh my god
 In the time that Nott was gone could I spot
the Allhammer temple Just so I know where it is
 
 Are there people watching the board right
now
 As soon as he walks away is there anybody
any guards looking at the board
 Thats a lot of guards at this one board
 Can I try sleight of hand and just try to
make that into Wangstacker
 It was a 
 It makes more sense
 Dont say it in the open you guys wait
until were in the bath
 Its tiny little Fjord
 Yes Miss Rima
 Oh I think we plan on doing a lot of
stuff so probably all together
 Rima is there someone who can take
clothing and clean it up as well while we are
bathing
 You probably shouldnt though
 They can stitch up the holes and stuff
 No you were Prestidigitationed
 Ew Like the poop splatter
 Four silver
 I run by her and say cannonball And jump
in
 Hair like the Little Mermaid
 Oh my god Yasha
 Is it all upper body
 What about the Prince Albert
 I do
 Did you see what happened in Alfield
 That was us We killed them all
 We told her where we were going to go
 We killed things for money
 Oh are you free of bandages and everything
too and we just cant see it
 Mmhmm
 So we still need a few people left
 Did you know theres a spell that can do
that
 Youre not getting in the water
 Youre just standing off to the side
Nott
 But youre naked
 Youre ready to come in Come into the
 What is it about it
 Yeah
 See How did it feel
 Are the old couple looking at us like were
weird
 Is there anyone else in this pool with us
 Yeah Its all ours Its a party room
now
 Myriad
 Probably a bad thing to do
 Platinum Dragon
  Do you worship the Traveler too
 Oh okay I thought I would have known you
if you did
 We have really small group meetings Its
usually just me
 What about you
 Yeah you dont have anything to hide from
us
 Everything is a milk bath
 He wanted people to join the military so
no
 I like killing roving beasts
 Nott do you want me to wash your hair for
you No one will see Because you look like Fjord
 We made so much money off of ears
 And were going to make a whole lot of
gold over at the Pillow Trove
 Its a fancy hotel place
 Mmhmm
 Shes the Ruby of the Sea
 I know
 You guys have really bad memories because
it was not like this at all
 Ive been sudsing up your hair You have to
do it to dunk your hair
 Which is whom
 Are you from the Menagerie Coast as well
 Are you from the empire
 Sorry Yasha This is a lot If you dont
want to answer I understand
 I trust her fully
 You stand uncomfortably close to people you
know and make them feel awkward And I walk really
close to you Fjord
 Oh no Fjord Are you melting
 Oh no youre turning into water
 Yes
 Is that what he was like
 He called us baby
 I get out and I start drying my hair and
try to get pretty
 They probably folded them up for us
 Who gives up first
 While you guys do that I need to go to The
Pillow Trove okay
 I need to go to The Pillow Trove which is
the nice tavern in the place
 No thats fine
 Its a quick errand I just need to pop in
and pop out you know how you do
 Before we leave I run up and give Yasha a
 Okiedokie
 Yes we have business at the Pillow Trove
 Oh well I have business at the Pillow
Trove
 I have a package thats being delivered
there What business do you have at the Pillow Trove
 Oh yes I hired him to protect me because
you know Im very fragile and delicate but if he
doesnt look well enough to be my guard youre
welcome to walk me instead
 
  Sorry Caleb Ill let you know 
what its like okay
  Frumpkin kitty kitty
 You guys are really on top of your shit in
here
 No you said one point
 He looks very embroidered and everything
 So they dispelled it
 What a dick
 Like Caesars Palace
 Can I ask the guard
 What is that
building
 No Im new to town actually
 Oh wow I didnt think you had things like
this in the Empire
 Im from the Menagerie Coast actually
Nicodranas
 Quite
 Thank you very much kind sir I walk
grandiosely up to the woman Hello I have a
package thats being delivered to here
 Jester
 Thank you very much
 Is anybody watching me
 Good day
 Maybe under Lavorre
 Okay
 Anything from The Ruby of the Sea maybe
 Okay thank you
 I smile back at the guard like pained
laugh this is crazy isnt it
 Well thats really weird Okay Well tell
you what how about because its probably going
to be coming you know Im here really early for
it you know so if it comes for me when it
does could you leave word with the guard outside
the TriSpire
 The guard house you know
 Then I can come and ask if its been
delivered and then I can come because I dont
want to have to walk all the way here you know
if its not here for me yet
 Okay Unless I should maybe stay here
waiting for it
 Oh Yes how much would that be
 Well I normally stay in the diplomatic
rooms but I guess the smallest room because you
know Im small
 Probably just tonight because itll
probably be here in the morning
 Yes
 Oh yes here you go thank you
 Oh thank you
  thats my favorite number
 Okay I go upstairs
 I sit down
 Right Hmm Traveler Are you here Shit
Okay I dont know where Im staying tonight
Traveler I might be here I might be with my
friends but Okay Ill see you soon okay And
I run back out of the room
  Hi
 Okay Do you think you could help me
though
 I know You do
 I dont know how to let her know I dont
know what to do
 Okay I pull out the pamphlet Look what I
made for you
 People are going to worship you like
crazy
 Yes Okay I missed you
  All right Im going to
walk if you want to follow me Im going to go
over here then
 I skip away
 I go back to the guard Okay I have a room
here I dont know if you need to escort me
anymore because Im staying here at The Pillow
Trove but Im going to go okay
 Okay
 Hey guard whats your name
 Reeve its so nice to meet you Im
Jester
 And I shake it
 Hey so that guy that I hired to guard me
I gave him some money What am I supposed to do
am I allowed to get him in here so he can actually
do his job
 The guy that was all in his tattered coat
and stuff
 Yeah
 But I hired him to guard me though
 All right Okay
 You know for six gold you could buy
yourself some real fancy clothes
 I guess I go back to Caleb
 It was really pretty in there People are
kind of stupid but I did talk to the Traveler so
everythings cool Also I dont have any money
 No I mean I have
 I mean thats about as much as I have now
Its so stupid though
 Its not Caleb
 Its not
 Thats what I made like every day for my
allowance
 Caleb I didnt mean to make you put your
shit on your face again
 Guess what Molly
 I got a room at The Pillow Trove
 Well because my package didnt come so I
thought that maybe if I got a room there then I
can check in in the morning as well maybe
 Yeah its been not enough time I dont
think
 Itll show up of course it will
 You just got to get some fancy clothes
man
 Oh hi
 No Not so much Not a lot of money
 No
 No Nothing really But I saw the Traveler
so thats good news everyone Hes still
around hes here Hes probably hanging out 
with us right now
 Yes Well probably yes
 Well not a lot of people know who he is yet so
really no I dont think Ill get in trouble
 Well I dont know if hes new but he is just
not wellknown especially here Im sure where
hes from everybody knows him because hes
really cool so I bet a lot of people are like
Oh my god I love you
 Yes basically
 Yeah Yeah hes really cool Hes so
powerful You guys should really see what he can
do because its amazing
 Well he can do lots of magic and he can
appear out of nowhere Thats cool
 No
 I can ask him Yeah
 Well Traveler you heard it yourself If
you like everyone here you can just show up anytime
 Well its possible hes just invisible right
now He does that sometimes
 Yeah
 Yeah it happens
 Yeah You know hes just this guy I dont
know exactly what he looks like because hes got
this hood
 I imagine that hes really handsome
 I think hes really cute He sounds really
cute He can probably hear me right now Im so
embarrassed

 Right Maybe hell start talking to you
too
 Oh well he might get you know what He
might think thats really fun That could be fun
 Maybe you have to get somewhere really
quiet because the first time I heard the Traveler
it was super duper quiet
 Fjord can I ask you a question
 Do you remember how long it took us to get
from Port Damali to the border into
 So wait If I sent a message from Alfield then
or wait Where were we when I sent that message
 Then would it have got to Nicodranas and
to Zadash by now
 Okay
 No I just had an itch you have a little
dirt on your face but other than that
 So maybe thats what it is thats why
 She was going to send it to The Pillow
Trove
 Yeah
 It would be a pretty expensive package so
I feel like maybe I could do that
 I dont know what it is but Ill look into
that I have a room there tonight you guys
 The thing is that apparently its not easy
to get into that district
 Shabby chic
 Maybe we can go somewhere and they will
make a coat exactly like that coat with all the
same pockets only it wont have the holes in it
 Yeah thats probably good too
 Or we just keep going to visit that guy who
made you clean Every day we could go see him and
then he makes us all clean
 What to use his power like that I want to
ask The Traveler if he knows how to do that
because I wonder if he could make me do that
 No Ive only seen that guy
 Mmhmm
 No theyre just unicorns
 Weve got to get to that sewer you guys
 But well have to get clean or else we
wont get in there
 I think they only have to let me in
technically
 I have this key It says Pillow Trove on
it
 Oh yeah Beau has it right now
 So is it better to go now or tomorrow
morning
 Late afternoon you said
 You have an adventurers kit
 Oh I have an axe now
 Yay
 Yes
 Yeah
 Its cold
 Hey guys were about two blocks away from the
outer wall Were super close
 What guard was it that ran away
 Theyre probably eaten completely by now
 Oh no but how will we get out
 What if we get trapped at another one and
then we cant get out
 Okay
 I move to the other side of Nott
  Do you see any monsters down
there
 Oh sure Wait which one was it
 What about this one
 You dont
 Can we come down
 He locked us in
 I think a monster would be down
 I feel like were walking in a stinky
crotch Why
 The Traveler
 Do we see any rats down here
 In the direction of where we came from
 Does that mean were going the wrong way or
the right way
 Ew
 Oh my God I didnt even put it together
 I just want this
 Is it blood
 I might throw up
 Yeah youre right
 We turn around
 You should probably lick the ground
everywhere and see if you taste that blood
anymore
 Any webbing
 Perception
 
 Guys guys look look Bring the torch
over
 Its a webbing
 Maybe that would be bad though Maybe you
should be in the middle Have you ever been at a
haunted house They come at you from behind
 I guess Ill be right behind Molly
 Yeah
 I bet thats where we need to go Its
blocked
  What is it
 Poke it with your stick
 How close is it to us
 Were fighting pooprats
 Thats what happens when I roll
one that I havent been charging up
 It just looks wet
 Matt is very committed
 Oh no See Caleb look you shouldve been
in the middle of us
  Level three
 Oh shit really
 Eight
 No mine was nine
 It mightve been eight Lets just make it
eight because I cant remember if I rolled a five
or a six
 You just got bit by a rat
running away
 Is it also yellow water
 Fjord Why you got to fart while were
fighting
 Oh no
 Thats good
 I look like I have an unarmed strike too
but I dont think I do
 Okay Im going to run up to the one that
just attacked Yasha Yeah and Im going to hit it
with my handaxe because Im not very smart
 That definitely hits Thats 
 Thats a seven
 Aw you see it was like  no fuck
you
 Oh no
 I think so
 Wait Yeah I dont want to use that just
yet
 Oh no
 Are there more rats
 Its really pretty though what a pretty
die
 Oh no Matt Wait how do we know where
were going though How will we choose
 Okay we go that way
 Oh no how hurt is everyone
 Right I should do a Cure Wounds on you
 Okay I cast Cure Wounds on Yasha
 Thats above your whole
 Thats why I said it Eight points
 Oh How hurt are you Beau
 Oh okay Let me know you guys because
Ive got lots of healing Because Im the cleric
 I think somethings making those things
like that
 Oh god what if its a giant spider
 And its infecting the rats 
And theyre turning into poisoned
 Poison balloons
 I think theyre full of pus
 Just really infected rats
 We should keep going Should we be more
sneaky or should we just walk
 We could set them on fire from a distance
 Yeah but what if they all spring up We
could just set them on fire
 Okay then let them live and die in
horrible pain
 Oh yeah here you go
 Who is the most noisy of us all Which one
of you fuckers needs some help
 Well here take an advantage
 Just kidding
 Hold on I have to check
 Eight Not so good
 Lets set it on fire
 Or it could be somebody thats being slowly
sucked dry of all their blood
 Should we set it on fire or should we see
if its living
 Is it wiggling at all
 
 I think its dead
 Or its sedated
 Its a dog
 Lets cut it down
 Thats good to know That means the
humansized ones are probably fucked up too
 How long ago did they say the guards went
down and didnt come back
 Yeah What if we back up and burn it
 Thats why I said why dont we back up and
burn it
 Well Caleb how about you send your
spectral servant to poke at the little masses of
human and see if they start wiggling
 Theyll probably end up as giant pus sacks
if they survive
 I said poke it Then if they wiggle then
we know that theyre alive
 Do it Caleb
 Its unseen
 I go up and I push it
 I think your unseen servant farted on me
 I wonder if the giant spider thing heard
that
  I said I wonder if the giant
 You
 Burn that shit then the spider will come
and we will burn that shit too
 Ill stand behind Fjord
 We could take their weapons I bet theyre
nice weapons Or we could return them to the
Crownsguard maybe they would reward us
 Can I take their helmets and put them in my
pink bag
 What about their weapons Do they have
any
 Does it say anywhere Property of the
Crownsguard
 How is it to try to chop through it with
the axe
 Yeah I want to try doing it and see if it
sticks to the weapon or if it cuts through
 Yeah
 Seven
 
 Except its covered in webbing so not as
much sound
 Can I get my handaxe back
 Thanks Caleb
 Its a dead end past all of this Its a
dead end and just goes up
 Its got to be around here somewhere
right
 Should I go up
 Okay
 Is it blocked in and webby all along the
ground
 I stop walking
 I dont like it either
 Is he reachable
  Hes still  feet away from
me You guys Hey fuckers
 Im a little worried about walking any
further because my feet are starting to stick to
the ground like a lot But theres a halfling
stuck to the wall over here and I dont think hes
dead
 No Im  feet away from it
 How close is it to you guys
 Oh no
 Its an invisible spider
 Were not invisible those are dead people
I see dead people
 Where before it disappeared
 Wait why are all the other things

 Its Relentless
 Yes
 You have something in your throat Molly

snatched it up
 Yeah she didnt get a session zero
 Yeah
 Its blinded
 Okay can I come around the corner and get
out of this nastiness Ooh it really did stick to it
 Can I see everything

thing didnt get there
 Thats so stupid Okay

 Does he look injured at all
 Oh shit Can I have grabbed that as I walk
over to him
 Can I put my hand on his head and cast Cure
Wounds
 Now 
 Blessed child You are alive Your saviors

 You dont know how you got down here You
didnt come to the sewer on your own
 No need to scream Were getting you out
dont worry
 Do you have a key to the grates
 Can you give us the key
 I thought he said dead
 Thed where is the key Which pocket is it
in
 I can start digging I start digging
through his pockets
 Thats a tattoo you said
 I rolled an  checking through his
pockets
 Okay
 Oh no eggs Oh no
 Kill it with fire I Sacred Flame it
 Got to kill them all
 Just keeping all that for yourself then
Yasha
 Did you say two sets of armor Would that
fit in the bag
 Would that fit in the bag Two sets of
armor
 Okay well bring these back to the
Crownsguard and hopefully get some reward
 Is everybody a greedy fuck in this game and
we just keep whatever
 Cool
 Vex never lied about the loot we found
 Never once Never once for all the shit
she got for being greedy she never once lied
about the loot
 Shes a terrible halfelf
 I didnt take anything from you
 I didnt take anything from his pockets
 
 Yeah its in the letter
 His name was Thed
 I didnt take anything from your pockets I
really didnt
 You really do have like a key to the
grates like an extra one
 Anything else interesting in the room
outside of the bodies
 Aww
 Both
 I wonder if this grate leads up into the
TriSpires then Maybe it means lots of rich
people are up here
 Maybe Easy pickings
 If they dont allow the criminals in then
theyd be real easy to pickpocket because no one
would expect it
 Well we can probably call up We have the
writ
 Well its all tied up Me and Yasha can
probably
 Sure I put my hands on either side of his
face Can I see anything weird
 Okay
 I do I do
 Caleb I dont
 Those are really really strong
 Okay but Im not keeping it just for me
you know
 Its for both of us
 Of course
 Caleb Thank you And Im sorry
 Do you need curing though Because your
eyes do look bloodshot
 All right well carry it
 Oh my gosh yes
 Because you have a big lollipop to carry
 Up these things into the money pot
 Well somebody that can talk to the
guards
 Is it locked
 Can you pick the lock
 Yeah I think its just two right now
 Hey you guys this is where my hotel is
 Are you trying to figure out if the stores
are still open
 Good call Ill get out my disguise kit and
put a mustache on the spider
 Its really bright and shiny in the hotel
though
 Should we just make it straight
 Just go straight and just stay
 Yeah lets go straight out and leave and
go to the Crownsguard
 Maybe we should shut the gate up and then
lock it
 So they dont know
 Oh yes dont worry were staying at the
Pillow Trove but we have this very beautiful writ
 Thank you
 Oh we are really powerful
 We killed it We took care of the monster
problem
 Were going to clean up well be back
This is not normally how we dress ugh we were in
the sewers
 The evil monster that was killing
everything
 Oh my gosh lots and lots and lots of baby
spiders
 We have armor too of some of your fallen
people will you reward us for that thank you
 Beau
 Stop it were about to get our reward
stop being a shithead right now
 I have them Heres two sets of armor
 And two extra helmets
 Leaky Tap
 At the Pillow Trove yes
 What does that mean of course you do
 I do have a room there I pull out my key
I have a room
 I dont know why it mattered

 Just the armor I didnt give back the
swords
 She seemed really nice
 Yes  gold I was going to wait
until we got somewhere private to do it but sure
Everyone take  gold
 We all smell like poop
 Yeah but we should probably get cleaned
up because theyre just going to stop us the minute we
get inside Should we go and see Pumat Sol and
see if hell make us clean
 Were not in the TriSpires anymore
 We have to get not stinky before we eat
okay
 Are we going to bed or are we what
 Were pretending that theres a bath
 Thats why we should have gone to Pumat
Sols
 His letter
 So I walked in and the guy was like you
know he had his arms above his head he was
chained to the bed right He didnt know where he
left the key I know I dont even know how long
hed been there
 Oh people will pay for all sorts of weird
things
 Oh hi guys
 The cult The orgy cult
 So they offered you money
 They offered you money to join in
 Dont you think its stupid to say all of
this right here
 Yes
 How can we be sure hes telling the truth
 But how do you know that he isnt setting
you up to be turned into the Crownsguard
 Like kicked to death
 Wait a minute is it wrong to pick wings
off flies Because thats not
 Not if theyre already dead then you can
pick the wings off super duper easily
 Whats a firefly
 Oh wow
 Oh yeah we can go back to the Pillow Trove
and all hang out and sleep in the same room if you want
 No its kind of little actually You
guys its really little actually
 Yeah we all look nice enough they might
let us in If not lets all go
 Yeah
 Sure we walk back to the guards and I show
them the key Can we get in
 All right
 Oh I dont really want to stay in there
alone
 The Evening Nip
 Does he look like mean at Fjord
 What is his type
 Pretty See Fjord youre just so
handsome
 Yeah maybe not the best place to
celebrate just putting it out there
 Maybe you should ask him about his tattoos
since you have tattoos as well
 Like unless were going to do this we
should get out
 Just go back to The Leaky Tap and then you
know
 This is awful and I dont want it
 Thank you Clive Bens
 I know I feel like its just at home
and we can just like
 Hes so stinky now
 Thats so cool
 Ulog
 Im tired This was a long day Are you
guys going to keep drinking
 Going to just drink at the Leaky Tap
 I guess we wont sleep at the fancy place
tonight
 Its a pain in the butt
 Nope it was just kind of fancy
 Mmhmm
 There was a minibar but I think you had to
pay a lot of gold for each little thing of it
 Hey Its like we dont even have to bathe
now
 Should we go to sleep
 We should fold up a blanket and put it
under there it muffles the noise
 Like 
 Or like 
 Yeah I bet that would be annoying if you
didnt like it
 What about like 
 Okay
 Yasha
 I didnt even know you were in the room
with us
 Yeah were all awake
 I sit down next to her and I show her some
of my drawings to the Traveler that I did before I
went to bed Look Yasha its rat balloons I
show her a little drawing I did
 Little rat balloons and one of them
exploding with poison coming out of it
 No Do you want me to draw you right now
Ill do it okay
 Okay
 I draw her lit up by the lightning and then
I go to sleep
 Maybe the lightning exploded her
 Yeah Maybe she wandered out into the rain
and lost her memory
 Doesnt it
 It seems possible
 Probably We should ask Molly
 Yeah
 What are your hit points this time
 Yeah I want to know
 Thats at least two kicks

 Im eating a carrot you guys figure it
out
 I will watch Im really good at keeping
watch
 Its really good
 You look just like him only slightly
shorter
 Ooh yes butt chin Those are always good
Ooh yes and give yourself red hair
 With red hair and a big patrician nose
 Ooh that sounds really attractive
 Molly
 Yashas gone
 She was staring at the storm and then she
went away
 Like in a protector I felt safe when she
was standing watch sort of way
 Were very normal
 I mean youre weird We already
established that
 What does that have to do with anything
 I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows
like this
 Oh this storm is so crazy
 We might stand out a little too much It
would be easy to recognize us as part of a meeting
like that Youre green but mostly you look
pretty normal outside of that
 What do you want to do when were supposed
to be keeping watch
 We could find a candy store
 There were in Nicodranas
 Did you want to go see Enchanter Pumat Sol
 I have to return my key to the Pillow
Trove
 Because I have a key to The Pillow Trove
Theyre going to keep charging me a room until I
give it back
 Well yes Eventually she will pay for it
I dont want to waste all of the money she sends
on paying for the room you know
 Im trying to be smarter
 Thank you Beau

 Open the curtains up
 Im dancing around the room while youre
looking
 Literally dancing around
 I crawl under the bed
 What makes it bullshitty
 I was seeing if anybody left anything good

 Are you going to do something Beau I
stick my head out Are you planning a rebellion
 Okay
 I believe you
 Oh sure I crawl out from under the bed
Caleb I got you a present

 Are there any religious temples here
 Thats shit Six
 What about in the Pillow Trove Do they
have a little library there
 Okay
 No I think Im good
  Lets go back to the stinky part
of town
 I guess I can go check out one of the
temples
 You probably got away with it You looked
like you were  when you were 
 I dont think were going to kill him right
off the bat
 He could have a whole infrastructure of
people supporting him and then they would come
after us
 Yeah
 I mean we could hang out in the lobby in
this bar and I could watch every person that
comes inside I could draw their picture and know
every single patron thats in here so that we have
something to turn into the guards when we rat
everybody out
 Just be distracting
 Were good at that
 We will hang out up here and just be weird
 Oh yeah I have the Tusk Love too
 I read it and I keep looking at Fjord
like and then go back and read it I assume its
about some sort of orc love
 Whats the name of the halforc
 Nothing Oskar Dont worry about it

 Thats the helmet we found in the
graveyard
 Did it look like an undercover cop trying
to blend in
 
 Should we be outside too Or should we stay
inside
 How will we know if you see anyone coming
 Okay you will Message us and then you
will Message the others
 Can you do it twice
 Okay
 Then well just hang out in here and have
some fun
 Is it just the four of them
  This is like us planning
 Taking a few licks
 Yeah lick those gladiator assholes
 I really have
 Does it say which one
 This is weird
 These are really really really good
 Thats a good fortune
 You have a booger on the tip of your nose
 Oh I just told a random person they had a
booger on the tip of their nose
 Youre a random person with a really
familiar voice though You need to talk to Fjord
and see if you can figure out how to sound different
 You were down there a really long time
 We should follow one of them
 Have the ones downstairs already left
 Wait blessings
 Its like a dry skin You got it
 Stealth role With advantage
 She basically looks like a Pennywise like
a teeny Pennywise peeking through their
 Maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her
house
 Its hard to find that out without seeming
suspicious isnt it
 But isnt it weird to go Where does the
HighRichter live
 Oh okay
 Lets disguise ourselves
 Yeah
 Do you want the rest of us to go tomorrow
or do we still need to be look out
 Should we look like ourselves or other
people
 I dont care
 Okay Ill decide on the day
 Maybe we can ask the owner of here
 Yes
 Okay Im going to go ask Claudia
 Oh its already that late
 Claudias not awake
 Maybe the barkeep
 Hey Wessek
 Hows it going with you Its really late
 Well I just remembered that I was supposed
to deliver a personal message to the HighRichter
and I cant remember where they live Do you
know
 Do you know what area of town it would be
in
 Probably like the TriSpires or something
 Okay that was a fun conversation goodbye
 The Pillow Trove is an inn of course its
open
  We totally can
 I said we totally can do that
 I feel like that would be a really big
enchantment to put on the the entire thing
 I like it
 Probably 
 Really
  What is it that you want knocking
on our door so late at night Caleb
smut

 What is it Caleb
  I think he was bragging at you
Good night Caleb
 That is majorly cocked
 You should have taken the cocked
 And then Oskar falls in love with her And
he carries her across a field and they love each
other so much
 Its the most beautiful story Beau
 Yeah
  Oh youre back again already
Caleb
 Whats wrong Did you guys get into a
fight
 Here Nott You can read this now
 Thats the Tusk Love
 Not poor folk rich folk
 It doesnt matter we cant be poor folk in
the TriSpire We need to be rich folk that need
help from the Richter
 Very high middle if not low upper
 Like a warm pink center
 Yes Oh Yes how about we have a trading
company How about some of our wares got stolen on
the road on the way to Zadash by a group of
bandits
 I have a forgery kit you guys
 We could change the name of the Baumbauchs
to something else
 What if we say Were from the Timalt
Company they never paid our invoice and they
stole our puppies
 Thats how we would know that it was a bad
guy Okay
 Yes and it is very sad
 To get all of us through
 Who all can make disguises for themselves
 You can cover up your face at least
 Why
 Blessing of the Trickster Advantage
 No we dont have to its not locked
 I try to break the gate I try to pull the
gate Im trying to pull it open
 Oh 
 Go go go
 Keep going
 Oh yeah avoid all the rat balloons
 You still have the blessing Does anybody
else need a blessing
 Seven
 Im going to cast Disguise Self and Im
going to be tan short elven woman in a royal
blue lace dress very similar to the one the lady
was wearing with the cut out And soft medium
hair pulled back in waves
 No we didnt I dont think we did
 I walk like him
 This looks really well fortified
 I want to come  I want to
come
 How about Marge
 They dont like cats here in the
TriSpire
 I follow behind him
 I like her already
 Terrible evil the Baumbauchs
 And they took our puppies
 Six
 A favor for a favor
 Also what do you think of puppies
 Erikson
 Every time Every time
 Like the puppy thing wasnt enough Come
on
 How dare you Erickson
 With a mustache
 And she said that tieflings were terrible
 Yeah but puppies Nott puppies
 Nott
 Yes
 She takes bribes Shes a corrupt
politician
 I guess we have to leave the TriSpire
then
 What time
 Just after noon You didnt get an hour
 Before we leave are there any benches
around just sitting
 I want to leave one of the pamphlets for
the Traveler sitting on a bench
 Minus one
 Any guards in the tavern
 Does it look like anybody is looking at us
anybody else in the tavern
 Ooh 
 Tonya Fancybottom Nice to meet you
 Im blue
 Would we be all going to this gala
together
 Oh so no party
 Hes pretty stealthy
 Do you have healing potions
 Just in case we get hurt or something
 Thank you
 He created them for us
 I watch Ulog
 I think it sounds fun Sure why not
 Ive never eaten a dog I feel like I would
feel really weird about it
 The Fancybottom name is one you can trust
 Do you have a good way to get into the
TriSpire
 Okay
 I feel like I wouldve been looking too
because I was watching for people at the beginning
of that
 I also have a spell that can make people
tell the truth
 Or no we can just go to the hall of the
Hall of Justice

 But the TriSpire
 Yeah
 Were going to do all that during the
gala
 Well half a day and then a whole other
day
 Where are we right now
 Wait what did you say I wasnt
listening
 There was a spiderweb in the corner of the
room and its really pretty
 Yes I am Why do you ask
 Yes Im very good at writing letters
 Well I guess we well just have to find a
letter within their house and then I can forge it
right away
 Im a really quick thinker and Im also a
pretty fast writer
 Okay
 But how will we leave something from the
HighRichter if I dont know actually what her
handwriting looks like yet
 A public record of her handwriting
 She is a judge after all right
 This is very complicated
 What if I go find the HighRichter and ask
for her autograph
 Yeah
 Really
 Thats right She was vain
 Oh yes we had one of those at our house
 Well no we just had a lot of secrets

 I bet that the people in the Knights
previously Knights they would know where Lord
Sutan lives
 Dont we know where Dolan lives
 Oh yes Harold Horris
 We cant be seen Wed have to be in
disguise or one of us
 Yes Lets go that way
 Go get him monk
 Should we go to Dolans house
 Maybe the Richters handwriting too
 Ulogs probably listening to us right now
 We shouldnt be seen with them
 Go do it Fjord
 Youre not going up there with him right
Because hes in disguise now You look the same Beau
 
 I thought that was a hawk
  HighRichters handwriting
 Oh I thought Sutan was a title like Lord
Lord Lord
  We need it more HighRichter

 We need the handwriting of the HighRichter
more than Lord Sutans handwriting
 

 Fuck  HighRichter
 Did you get the handwriting
 Fjord we need it Really bad
 Did you not get it
 Just say hey the whole point of this was
to find the HighRichters handwriting as well
and maybe
 Whoa that is really good Fjord you did a
really good job in there
 What if we get some parchment that says
from the home office of Lord Sutan
 Or we can go up a few of us through the
actual front gates and then meet up with everyone
 Okay
 Oh
 I thought Beau might be able to get through
the gates actually
 Huh
 Yeah and its not a magical disguise
 Okay
  Well its such a thing to get
into the sewers We have to make a distraction and
everything every time
 Right
 Yes we wont get into any trouble
 We know our way around
 Or just at the Leaky Tap
 Lets just meet back at the Leaky Tap
 Yeah
 Lets go
 Woo
 She came through earlier Shes with me
 How high are the buildings next to the
house
 Okay That seems usable
 Like a five feet jump
 From like a swinging branch
 Are there windows on that side of the
house
 Is there a balcony connected to them
 So a few guards
 A dog
 I love dogs
 Okay I wonder if anything would lure the
guards away from the house
 Maybe
 Maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the
front of the house or something
 Or in the back
 Yeah
 Some people jump up and over
 Yeah Oh man Maybe we could get some rope
and a grapple
 We could throw a grapple for ten feet I
know that
 We can go get a climbers kit
 We did a good job scouting this place out
and stuff
 Are they pointytop iron bars
 I bet it does
 Can you stick your fingers through the
bar
 Yeah
 Disintegrate
 Oh no
 Mmhmm
 Thats personal Marisha experience isnt
it
 I feel like that would be a really good
idea I feel like it might be a little noticeable
to carry around a rug
 Most people in the TriSpire dont carry
around bedrolls
 Yes but its little
 Youre not there
 I think are we good
 What if we dont want the whole kit just
the grapple part of it and the rope
 And the rope
 What is fully included in the climbers
kit
 Yes that would probably be a good idea
  The cheaper one
 That I use for different things
 I dont use them at all
 Okay
 Ill get rid of Ill pay for it
 Simon became a real boy
 Gross
 Spend an hour painting your dick
 Ugh
 In your butt
 No no hes pointing the other direction
 Theyre looking at him but you were
running away
 Why do you smell like beer
 Gross
 Did you go in and say Can I speak to Ren
and then somebody else go in his office while
somebody was in the front asking to talk to Ren
 Oh okay
 Oh well we cased out his house We found
a big tree that we can hop the fence with Oh and
we bought this rope and this grapple so that we
can climb
 Well so that we can break into the house
yes
 Is that what all of these things are
 I cast Cure Wounds on Molly
 Yeah nobody mentioned anything about
needing handwriting right
 No talk of his father at all right
 Well we have Rens handwriting We could
potentially put a note in somebodys house with
his stuff but I dont know if thats what the
plan is
 HR wants a meeting with you
 The Big O We should say Big O
 Ill start writing that note right now
 Ill make it look crisp and
 Yeah like evil handwriting
 Yeah Got your messages I will move the
meeting up and the Big O is going to die for sure
 But where are we going to get this money
you keep talking about
 Heres the thing having seen people be
for bribing Especially with rich people Theyre
not going to need  gold to do this sort of
thing they want  gold for this sort of
thing
 A check An IOU On behalf of HR 
 So no hearts above the is then
 I write On behalf of HR 
 What comes after that
 On behalf of HR the plan 
 The plan is moving up to tomorrow night
at the festival
 Thats what I write
 Yours truly forever and ever your BFF

 No
 Yeah I thought it was good
 If I fold it up like a little triangle
Just a simple
 Oh wait Should I fold it or should I
scroll it
 Can the cat get the dog
 Yeah
 Theyll chase after the dog
 We can try that If it doesnt work then
we try to jump up and over
 And relieve him
 Say that somebody really wants him over at
the party
 Watching your face Matt as all that was
happening You were like what are they doing
  Pillow fight
 Ow okay Were done
 Maybe we should so that we stealth better
 We can put it in the pink bag
 The carnival is going on today
 Well were not actually going to the fancy
gala so we probably dont need the fancy stuff
because its just for the rich people
 Well I figure for all of us to get in we
should go through the sewers probably
 Sure
 Yeah
 Lets go buy some masks then
 Theres no point in worrying about things
you cant change yet Caleb
 Oh and Im going to write another letter
that says something about the Knights of Requital
That says like what should it be Im glad to
be working with you You sure are nice
 Yeah Ill end it with the big red door
The Knights of Requital Then rip it and then it
is just the bottom part and leave it in the
HighRichters house
 Oh can somebody burn the edge like the
rest was in the fire or something Oh and then we
can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the
letter was burned
 Caleb burn just these edges here
 But just the edges dont set the whole
thing on fire because I spent a really long time
writing that little bit
 I write all of that okay fine
 Yeah Then Ill put the symbol But Im
also going to keep this one to put in the
fireplace because I think it will be really cool
 Now we have those letters Im going to
keep track Im putting them in the side pouch
those are the side pouch ones
 Is that going in Lord Sutans place or the
HighRichters place
 So Im putting that in the other pouch
 We are definitely this is going to be
real good
 What are we being paid for this
 Is Ulog around Im going to look for Ulog
 I want to look and see if hes around us
though
 I cant see shit
 I should definitely go into Lord Sutans
place because I have this really fun spell that
lets me find things So I could find the seal
 I go I want to find this wax seal and
it will help me find the one thats closest
 Youre going to steal some stuff
 Sausage for the guard cat for the dog
 Where are we meeting Ulog
 Do you want to eat him even more now
 Oh I wonder if we can hide under the
carriages and just ride in
 Its all about trying to get into the sewer
system
 Lets just go to the sewers
 Maybe I can go talk to the guard Distract
him
 Oh hes not even looking at the gate
 Its dark outside too
 Oh sure Ill go meet you at the sewer
entrance on the other side
 Okay I walk up to the guard
 Evening how are you doing today
 Pretty good I was wondering if you could
answer a question for me
 I was looking around this area earlier for
a candy shop and I couldnt find anything that
seemed good I was wondering if you could point me
in the best direction
 The Pentamarket um okay Can you tell me
exactly where that is Because Im not familiar
with the area
 Oh no Oh thats okay

 Yay
 Oh come on
  Can you help me I
think Im choking
 Oh no Seven
 
 Oh no I cant breathe at all though
 I fall over on the ground and really like

 
 Oh it was my spit I was choking on my own
spit
 Thank you very much for all of your help
 Oh we didnt meet the guy at the Song and
Supper
 Yeah I just remembered it Im going to
the Song and Supper Inn
 We were waiting for you Its so weird that
we totally missed you though
 Well well well 
 They are Heres the thing How rich do
you look How rich does he look
 Can I put some of my costume on him
 Ill put some of my festive wear on him
 Itll get you in the door dont worry
Here put this mask on
 Oh thats great
 Guest of honor for the night Hes a
comedian
 Come on It is being so mean Seven God
damn it
 Heres the thing Hes not a joketelling
kind of comedian Hes more of a farce kind of
comedian Physical comedy Its more like a
jester if you will And I push him and so he
falls down See
 Hes so good He really sells it
 But I got you in the door right
 I got Ulog
 I know
 I have no freaking clue Hey Ulog what do
you want to do
 Okay
 We cased it earlier
 Yes
 It would look really pretty on you
 I think yellow would look good on you
 Oh wait Who sucks
 Who hasnt rolled yet Taliesin I give you
a blessing
 
 But theres still a gate
 How wide are the openings in the gate Does
it look like the mastiff could get through the
openings in the wroughtiron fence
 We could use the tree to get over the fence
and then run to the cellar
 He walks up to him and say
 Ulog What do you think Youre really good
at this
 That was at the HighRichters house That
wasnt here
 Right
 We can climb a tree Were good at that
 And I got this grapple so we can swing
across to the roof on the other side
 Or let him create it the first time
because we might not need it
 We swing it over Somebody needs to make a
loud noise when we throw the grapple over
 So that it doesnt make a clang sound that
they hear
 I could maybe use like Thaumaturgy to
create a thunder sound
 If it happens at the same time
 Okay Ill do that
 Sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere
 Oh good
 Do we get advantage because Beaus helping
us
 Shh
 I rolled 
 Should I try it
 Its a grapple Connected to a rope
 So I hand the other side of the rope to
Ulog so it doesnt fall
 Well Im strong
 Yeah but youre weak arent you
 No but youre precise
 Yeah On three
 Okay Ill throw it
 Oh that was good okay
 No 
 Thunder thunder When I did it
 More thunder Another thunder
 I do another thunder sound right when I
pull it so it doesnt make noise
 Here It is a strength thing though
 No No Ulog was holding 
onto the end of it
 I catch I try to catch the rope to try to
keep it from hitting the ground
 Ill try
 I did I tried
 I rolled a  I dont know what Im
adding
 You can jump ten feet
 Oh dear lord What if you fall on the
ground Beau
 Yeah
 Just so its not a one No ones
 The ropes not Oh were you holding onto
the grapple
 Great So well tie off the other side
Yeah
  We shimmy
 Well we do that
 When we lower into the cellar right
when
 Well how

 We run as soon as were in
 I guess Ill cast Cure Wounds on myself as

like it had wine spilled on it Like covering up
the rest of the outfit a big
 A white cloak that looks like it had red
wine spilled down the front Fjord you explain to
the guards that Im very pissed off because
someone spilled their drink on me
 Why are you going in
 Were disguised and were walking straight
up
 I look incredibly angry
 Just walking Why Im walking
 Thats 
 I breathe really hard
 Is anybody inside the house
 There were a lot of traps in the last house
we were in
 Why Why are we adding more things to
this
 Same Im looking around
 There was a little brick that turned off
all the magic things in the other place so maybe
can I look around on the walls and see if theres
some sort of
 To see if theres a trigger to stop all the
traps
 Lets turn them We turn them together
 Yeah sure We start walking to look for
her room
 Youve been made
 Whats that Do you think somebody just got
home
 Okay We keep looking for traps up on the
top floor and looking for a bedroom

found is there any other good place like in her
bedside tables or anything like that
 Is there clutter on the desk at all or
decorations and stuff
 Ill fold up the Knights of Requital letter
and hide it under her clock
 Leave a little bit showing in the back so

 I think we should let him go I think hes
handsome
 How long does charm spell work

 Will the beacon hurt people though
 Im going to insight check him
 
  Was it the Gentleman Is he who
helped you in
 Ooh thats not bad

 And then you can be our friends later
 He wont He likes us right You wont do
it Will you promise not to hurt us later
 But what if we give it back though
 Oh man This is a really tough one
 What about the beacon
 I think we give him the beacon and we walk
away
 Maybe you can look at the beacon one more
time and try to see what it is and then we can
give it back to him
 Can I look at the beacon
  Give it back to him
 You have it
 Oh it is I go and look at it
  I hum back at it
 What does he do when were looking at it
 Yeah
 It didnt do it The beacon wasnt the
thing that did it

 He doesnt like the other wizards
 It was stolen from him We should just let
him have it
 Leylas Krynn Did I say it right
 Nice
 Empress o the drow Or o Marrow Valley
 Oh right My facts are
 So thats where youre from Xhorhas
 And the Dwendalian Empire is fighting you
And theyre stealing your babies Because this is
the only way you can have babies
 It all makes perfect sense to me
 I say we give him the thing and let him
walk around naked because thats better
 Then you can get out
 Were leaving the beacon on the ground
Beau
 Im okay with this
 Maybe you should stare at it some more
 I pull out oh wait you know what I
think I dont have full armor for the crownsguard
because I gave them away I gave them back
 We dont got no crownsguard armor
 He gets his armor back But you dont have
the shoes okay

 You asked for two people
 Nobody else spoke up

 Is there a crowd around it
 Can we run interference and try to trip the
guard and get the thing back
 What if we go try to look at the body and
then we accidentally fall on one of the guards and
we make him drop it and then Nott picks it up and
runs away
 I run up and try to look at the body
 Whoa what is that Is that a dead body

 Can I trip and fall right in front of the
guard thats carrying the thing

guard carrying the thing as Im trying to look at
the body

 Whats her name
 I look down at the paperwork on the table
too
 Is that what it says
  Okay Lauren Thats a good name
I heard when we were coming back that they were
putting the city on lockdown so if youre going
to leave you should probably do it quickly
 All right
 Good night Thank you Claudia for all of
this
 I walk very slowly out of the room and keep
looking over my shoulder as Im doing it and
smiling back at her
 Okay Im going to put this in my room
thank you
 Oh no

instead of in the
 Yeah
 Mmhmm
 We did have a pillow fight
  Nott what is this made out
of
 Is it made of lead
 I really was trying to get a lead box
 Its true
 Well we can still put stuff in it if we
want to
 Hey Claudia was aware that we guys were in
league with the Knights of Requital
 Claudia says shes selling the tavern
 Yeah Like tonight
 To a girl named Lauren Spizzick or
something
 So she said she was selling it and I said
Wouldnt that draw attention to the tavern
though and she said no just her But if it
does and she knows then maybe it could lead the
guards to us though
 It might be smart but that might be
 Wait Horris came with us
 Horris is in this room right now
 Aw come on man
 You should go to the coast You should get
out of the empire
 I dont know if shes leaving town Shes
just selling the tavern
 Why Are you not going to
  Where
 Thats a lot of platinum
 Okay so we also got lets look This
sword
 Its pretty wickedlooking
 We also have these really super cool spiky
boots
 I think you put them on your feet and they
protect them
 I dont think they go with your pants
 Its weird to see the bottom of your pants
because you normally have those thighhighs on
 Yes Okay we also have these three
daggers which look like Are they ceremonial Do
they look
 I lick one then I lick the safe Is it
iron then
 Oh and we dont have the armor anymore we
gave it back to him
 You take your pants back off
 Exactly Will you send a message to Caleb

 So were doing it
 Okay okay okay
 This way
 Bye Caleb
 You dont roll a d for hit points Sam
 Im grabbing my bag
 Oh gosh
 We had no time
 Whoa nice
 Because thats your modifier
 Aw three
 Thats amazing
 I feel like that was really bad That was a
really bad roll
 Yes thats the rule
 Get the rest of my morning on
 Wasnt there a woman who was also
 part of the Knights of Requital
 What happened to her
 But she saw you guys
 At one of the meetings
 If anyone is going to turn us in it would
be her
 Wheres Horris Maybe he knows something
about her
 Horris
 Do you know where Kara is
 Do you know where she lives
 Do you know what she does
 The Evening Nip She works at the Evening
Nip
 Okay
 Do the sewers lead out of the city
 The manticore head Oh I bet it smells so
bad
 Oh god
 Yeah we do know a smuggler
 Ulysses Ulysses Stanneras
 He was in that yellow cloak Remember
 We need a lead box Should we go try to buy
a lead box
 But how would we tell him why we need it
 Dont you think somebody would be asking
Who recently bought something that would protect
against scrying
 I know I wrote it down
 Im trying to find where I wrote down
Bryces connections I think I wrote it down in a
different
 So its got to be that
 The radiation area in Fallout Its like
get out Get out now
 And I cant find it in these notes either
Shit
 Yes
 being a sister It was Claudia
 No wonder I dont have it in my notes
 We figured it out
 The Evening Nip
 Thats going to be me in a few months
 No we need a lead box thats
probably more important
 Or a blacksmith I feel like a blacksmith
would be more
 Yeah Lets go to that
 Yeah that was the first place we went
 You need to take Luck as a feat again
 Yes Do you make anything out of lead
 Could you perhaps make me a really pretty
so my mother is a big fan of things made out of
lead She said she likes the color of that metal
 She gets a lot of things in gold and
stuff and so she says that lead looks very
different from that and she thinks its pretty
 So I want to make her a really pretty
jewelry box out of lead
 Okay Its like she has a lot of jewelry
so something like around this big
 Oh so not a whole lead box maybe like a
box made out of wood and then pretty lead on the inside
 Or maybe on the outside so she doesnt
realize its not made of lead
 Hes a good friend of my moms
 I think that is acceptable yes
 Here Will you also engrave it with Love
you so much
 Okay
 Okay If we give you more could you make it
faster
 I noticed theyre blocking up the gates
and I need to get it to her because her birthdays
coming up
 All right
 Okay Thank you
 Thats a couple days
 Should we check with Pumat Sol and see if
he has something like that
 He would be more aware of what were
asking for if we asked for it As opposed to the
blacksmith
 Okay
 Just me
 What is it
 That attacked us you mean
 Will they be able to find it through the
fancy bag
 I hold it up to my ear Is anybody trying
to talk to me right now
 How do we oh okay Can they hear me
talking to it right now
 Wait Dont pass it out out here
 Before
 Would it hear our voice or would it 
 What if we say to it Hey man We found
this stone on the ground Who do you belong to
What do you think
 I know and then you call the mom
 Okay
 All right Its in the bag
 How do you know How do you know hes not
working for the Empire
 The only store in the Empire
 Hes probably working for the Empire
 I dont want to trust him
 I had a dream about Pumat Sol attacking
us
 I did I had a dream about it
 This is Laura actually I did have a
dream
 No it really was It was a dream that
Pumat Sol betrayed us and he attacked us all
Anyway
 Im just letting you know We dont know
anything about him
 Anyway I dont want to bring out all of
this stuff from the assassin guy in front of him
 Yes
 Are you open all the time
 Well my moms birthday is coming up and
she really likes boxes that have Do you have a
leadlined box
 Oh good
 Can we get one of those
 Probably the grande The middle
 Still out of the reach there
in the window
 What does it look like though
 What does it do
 Oh Thats pretty cool
 How much is your fancy box
 Its probably smart though huh Its probably
made a bit better
 She really is Shes always asking
questions that are weird
 She can catch arrows out of midair
 Thats a lot of gold
 We should buy that box
 It was  gold
 We should probably get back and put the
thing in this box though
 What should we have him make
 Ill buy a healing potion
 Sicrulalium
 What mages were you with What mages found
you Were they with the Academy
 Thats right you were talking about them
before
 Okay
 Shocking Grasp
 Did you just call him asshole
 Should we go
 What guy
 No
 It sounds like smut to me
 You just wait
 Lets go Come on there are things that
need to be taken care of Caleb
 But we will be back because we like you so
much
 Thank you
 Lets go Come on weve got to get back
to the Tap
 Yeah and to look at the stuff Caleb
identified for us
 Yeah
 Lets put it in the thing
 What like on me all the time
 I mean I can carry this box with me all
the time but dont you think its weird to carry
around a box all the time
 I put it in the bag

 How long does it take to take effect if were
all going to die
 Eventually I put my bag back on
 What is it What are they What do they
do
 Is it
 Could I use that A longsword
 Did I put that down I might have written
my proficiencies
 Simple weapons
 Could Yasha use that
 Oh Thats great
 I hope shes still in the city because
otherwise shes going to have a really hard time
trying to get back in
 I dont think anyone can use it
 What do the boots do
 Is it kind of obvious
 Well normally youre barefoot so it looks
pretty good It makes your pants billow a little
weird but I like it
 Can you handle the truth
 Ooh I take out the Wand of Smiles and I
cast it at her
 Charisma
 Now you look so happy Its so wonderful
 Oh right What are we supposed to do now
 But wait
 What does The General have to do with
 What does the Gentleman have to do with
this plan though
 Oh thats what it was Okay so we go to
the Evening Nip to investigate her and then we
just happen to talk to the Gentleman too
 I wonder if its all a distraction though
for the big stuff
 Well that was the HighRichters house
But Lord Sutan probably went home and noticed his
rug was missing
 And so did he go to the guards or did he
go Oh shit I was hiding something
 Yes but we put evidence in his house So
if he noticed that the rug was missing
 He goes to the Crownsguard to report a
robbery Then they go in and they find the
evidence that he was actually trying to be behind
the attack that happened So it actually is good
that we destroyed the rug because it led the
guards into his house
 But he Are you okay Beau
 It can be
 Should we go spy on his house and see if
there are crownsguard in it
 Do you think they would let anyone back
into the TriSpire
 For what
 I am sad that I did that to her because
 Shit
 Hi
 Yes I would like some milk
 Do we follow him
 All of us
 Lucien Thats a cool name
 Everybodys a liar
 You sneaky bastard
 Wait what
 Just kidding I was watching
  They killed him
 Nonagon
 I remember that Fjord asked me to be in his
boat
 Yeah
 Nonagon  Na na nana
 Yeah
 Our ship is so colorful
 Although I think probably Fjord I should
be the one paddling the boat because Im a bit
stronger than you
 Okay
 No I just no
 Im glad Im back
 Oh gosh
 Are we going to fight undead things What
is going on
 This is just like that scene in Tusk Love
 The scene where the ship is sinking and
Oskar and Genevieve have to paddle to shore
 Guinevere Thats was it was I remember
Oskar a little more Only Oskar was paddling in
that one
 It is
 Should one of us go in one and one of us go
in the other
 Should we go in the bow or the stern
 Can we feel more wind coming from either
side
 
 You should row backwards too Yasha
 I think left
 Should I follow them
 Okay
 So youd be fucked
  Its just like the rug
 Oh my god
 I rolled a one too

 Oh cool I like the cat just like blah
 We rolled real bad
 Five
 You dont have any initiative
 Okay so you rolled a three Good job
 It looks like no Im seeing your angle
 Oh my glasses are in my car shit
 Oh its like Hunters Mark
 Wait another one came down on Fjord
 Oh no
 Its going to make us blind too we got to
kill it quick
 It looks like he was being born
 I cant see anything on the other side
 Yeah I mean I will move the boat closer
up
 Oh that was terrible six
 I cant move the boat yall
 Okay Does that count as an action or a
movement
 Cool
 Thanks This is fun guys All right then
Im going to save
 Yeah Thats what I got I guess Yeah
Sweet
 Did you hear a splash
 Oh no
 Oh
 Thats not a rock
 Things are looking up you guys
 Leap for it
 Because its a ranged attack
 Skip off the ground
 Earth elementals
 
 Oh my god
 Oh gosh Well I hate to use my action to
do anything else but I should probably try to get
away from the thing thats on the shore huh
 Im going to action row
 Strength check
 Thats a good one Thats just Jesters
strength Thats a 
 Im going to use my bonus action to turn
 Oh god
 Its pitch dark
 It got eaten by the darkness
 We crash into each other and get stuck Ah
let me go
 I think those things are going to get us
 I know Actually Im feeling a little
guilty for calling him What if he just wanted to
be friends
 Im trying
 
 Yeah were rowing backwards
 Slowly
 Should we park the boats
 Can we have some light
 A little less blue
 Can we clear out these rocks
 But were right here
 Well thats totally cocked that was
terrible Athletics
 
 Ooh Hey Caleb look Dont you want to
steal that Its probably magic
 Would you want to go up
 Its a couple flights up though you
said
 Lets go down Usually scarier things are
down
 Yeah so Nott in front
 I guess I can be after Yasha
 Okay
 Are we free of traps in this little
 Okay
 Should we send Frumpkin down there and see
if its clear
 Oh yeah Cats can see
 The rules need to be changed
 Why dont you send your little dancing
lights down there with him
 What if I just send something thats on
fire and I throw it down the tunnel
 Really
 Oh its resetting
 Were just seeing you Youre really close
to us arent you
 Can you disarm the traps so you dont keep
just setting them off
 A button
 Are there any more
 Oh no is this going to be a puzzle
 Oh fuck me
 No Im going to run
 You can do it
 Its okay Nott
 I pat your head You know its a lot of
stress Youre learning still
 Then the log coming down
 Were at Burning Man arent we Were at
Burning Man
 That things going to try to kill us
 Oh wow Its big
 What skills you got
 What This is intricate
 Are all those facing towards Fjord
 On the ground Just on the ground
 Yeah take your time
 Are the symbols just painted on the ground
or are they carved into the ground
 Theyre on the ceiling
 Does that mean we have to cast some spells
or something
 I wonder if you have to stick something in
the hole and twist it
 Stick your wang in it
 Oh because of the thing in the middle
 Does the pillar coming out of the ceiling
have a hole in it as well
 I am really good at finding holes
 Yeah 
 But the hole is
 Yeah the hole is
 I open up my sketchbook and I start drawing
the symbols Here look I made this beautiful picture
 Well Im really talented
 Cantrip No
 
 Im sorry
 Oh I can help you You want me to heal
you
 Im going to cast Cure Wounds
 Yes
 I did it on you too So thats seven
points of healing for you
 Does that help
 Yeah Ill looking for willowisps
 Yes Thats real good
 Seven
 Deadless
 Does that look like that shape
 How big
 Do you want me to throw something up at the
vase and try to knock it over
 Im going to get down on the ground
 Ayyyy Theres a rod
 Where are the faces on the ground
 Yeah
 Whoa
 Should I stick something in these eyes
 Dont break it
 Wait do you double it because its a
critical
 I was wherever those bodies where because
I was kneeling down and looking at them
 It look like lightning corn on the cob
 Oh no Its like never ending
 Its not a surprise at least
 
 These are the willowisps
 Arent willowisps like kids Arent they
the spirits of children
 Thats what I learned in Quest for Glory

Shadows of Darkness
  didnt hit them
 Okay As a bonus action Im going to cast
Sanctuary on Nott
 It doesnt say concentration
 It doesnt have that on the
 They have to make a wisdom save if they
attack her Then as an action Im going to use my
cantrip of Sacred Flame
 The one next to Molly
 No its a dex save
 It definitely saves
 She rolled six
 I should have thrown something at the
vase
 Those guys were so stupid They could have
broken the vases How dumb are they
 You want me to try to heal you
 Ill try to heal you
 Im going to cast at a ndlevel Cure
Wounds because Nott seems like shes dying
 Goddamn it Really
 One and a two
 I couldve cast it at stlevel Damn it
You still only got fucking seven points of fucking healing
 Goddamn it
 I just wasted one of my ndlevels yall
 Which room Lets take the piece of metal
down Wait does each of the urns have a different one
 Oh
 Yeah
 Charred
 Fjord do you see anything cool down
there
 Does anybody have weapons or coins on
them
 Well get you out Just look for something
cool though
 You can ask nicely
 Everybody else was resting up top while
 Its okay because I dont get my spells
back with rests so thats really good that I used
it and everything
 Yeah
 She needs better organization
 You got to divide them out
 I think the corkscrews going to stick in
the hole and move the whole room or something
 We can try to move some of the rubble
 Do we know which way were turning
everything now
 Oh everybody knows it already
 But why did you decide the way that youre
saying it
 Yeah I like the way you guys think that
sounds smart
 So thats evocation you guys and
divination and necromancy
 Maybe its got to be a real person Maybe
you have to cast a spell that has to do with the
class of magic
 Cast a spell on one of the bowls
  No its fine
 I dont know I could Inflict Wounds on it
or something or Toll the Dead on the bowl
 Well no Im going to use a cantrip because
its better So Im going to Toll the Dead on
 Necrotic divination and evocation So
Ill try to Toll the Dead on one of the bowls the
one that is sitting on the diamond
 Wait is it turning
 Yeah
 See this is why I shouldnt have used my
spell
 That wasnt a dick joke
 
 I dont know how do you fight a gelatinous
cube
 I know
 But I dont know how to defeat them
 Can it By magic maybe
 How long does the spell last
 Im going to back up away from it
 Im going to use the Sacred Flame cantrip
because I figure its not very dextrous
 Its a d radiant damage
 Six
 Did it look like it did anything to it
 Yes
 Is there something in it
 Back away from it What if a tentacle comes
out of it or something
 Theres no harm in raging
 Assault it
 Advantage She has advantage because
 Its a cube
 Did she get oh nevermind
 No its more than that
 Heres ten plus five 
 
 Stupid cube
 Oh no Is she poisoned
 I know right
 Highlevel rogue was still pretty cool
 Oh no it breaks free
 Beaus right next to it Its going to
slurp you
 Half of its movement
 Oh no Whos it going for
 No
 Oh man and its right next to me now Oh
god Okay
 Ooh Im going to cast Toll the Dead on it
 Its a wisdom save
 Also 
 Balls Okay
 Okay then I guess Im going to 
try to back away from it
 Towards Fjord
 A little further if I can please
 Because it probably cant move very far
 Bitch of a fucking marshmallow
 Im out Im unconscious
 I was
 Yeah
 If I die tonight when I decided to come
and play even though Im coughing
 Im going to die you guys
 When does the cube go
 Oh Oskar
 Thank you for saving me
 Sorry I mean Fjord
 Yes
 Oh Did we kill it
 Sorry I think that was my fault you
guys
 Who has divination though
 Does anybody have one of those
 Can your mage hand lift you up
 Wait I have an idea Maybe we should take
the bowls outside of the room and cast something
on the bowls and see if one of the symbols on the
bowls light up That way the staff doesnt absorb
the spell immediately Because when I cast Toll
the Dead I was trying to cast it on the bowl
right But instead my spell went up into the
middle of the staff Maybe if we try casting it on
the bowls outside of the room that wont happen
 Just so we dont have to fight another
cube just in case
 How many points of healing did you give me
When you poured the spell in my mouth
 Im feeling like Im a little sick right
now but you know
 Im feel like Ive got very little health
Like Im bleeding a little bit from my ears
 Caleb I have healing spells still Its
okay
 I wasnt bitching at all You asked
 Lets fucking go out into this hallway
okay
 Should we try casting a spell on one of the
bowls and see what happens
 No we dont I dont think so because
were not in the room anymore so we can try to see
if the bowls do anything
 Im going to cast my Spare the Dying
cantrip
 Necromancy
 Wait I blow on the bowl Does it look like
any of the symbols got any brighter
 Do we need to set these on fire
 You need three spells
 We need to set it on fire
 Hold the torch under one of the bowls
 Just hold it under and see what happens
 Hold the torch under one of them for a long
time and see what happens
 Woah Here we go
 We were wrong about what we needed to
cast
 Thats that one
 What is this
 Illusion We need an illusion
 Transmutation
 I have an enchantment
 I can transmute or something
 I think so
 We dont even need the bowls
 Wait I got to find my spell that actually
does the thing that I said I could do
 Wait I have enchantment
 Enchantment
 I have enchantment
 Okay Ill go stand by the enchantment
under the symbol for enchantment just in case
 Can you do enchantment
 I think were casting it at the staff
 Do we need to be standing in front of the
symbol that it lines up with
 Ill go stand in front of the three dots
 We count to three and we go
 Im doing Hold Person
 Hold Person
 Oh man
 Thats good because who knows what else
well run into while were down here
 You should detect traps
 Beau should I use my last spell to heal
myself
 So I should cast the spell on myself
 This seems like a waste of money Im
trying to be smarter with my money
 Be careful
 Im hanging out with Caleb and Beau
 The willowisps
 Are we in the other room still or did we
come in
 Can I look around the room
 Were in the room Lets go
 Ooh Ill climb up on the bookshelf
 Does it look trapped Is this trapped on
the wall
 Climb up on the bookshelf with me
 Should I try to pull it out
 I lift I pull and I try to pull it off
the wall
 Good job not getting stabbed you guys
because this is sharplooking
 This is a sacrificial blade for sure
 Im holding it
 Its pretty girthy Can you identify it
 Ill strap it to my back
 Its very sharp and the bag is easily
punctured and I dont want to risk it Ill strap
it to my back
 Ooh
 Why
 The thing is he probably wont ever tell
us
 Say it all out loud
 What
 But then this sword belongs to the guy who
came to save Siff The bounty hunter
 What was the thing about fire or ice
though It was like fire or ice
 Hold what still
 Im good
 I dont have hardly any hit points
 Ive got a ndlevel and a stlevel
 We should probably run
 Was he coming up out of the teleportation
circle
 We could run away bring the book and run
away
 This guy is way beyond our level
 He keeps saying seemingly He keeps saying
that
 Thats right We marked our places on the
map where we left last time
 Are you Siff
 Secrets are fun
 I have a secret for you Did you know that
in Nicodranas the pastries are made with cinnamon
and here theyre not

 Oh no
 I gave him a secret
 Oh no I thought I was helping
 Hes in the teleportation circle
 
 I wanted to talk
 Shit balls
 Hey I just made us  you guys

 Run away
 That was the weirdest cutest hiccup Ive
ever heard
 Theres going to be a thing that comes out
there I think
 Thats what he did to Beau
 You got it Yasha Take him down Its one
hit
 Maybe we can activate it
 Kill that floating dude Maybe he just
flies Maybe hes got feet and his robes cover
them up
 Yeah
 Can you hear it
 
 Wait I have a question When were
paralyzed does that mean every attack against us
is a critical
 Okay Im done
 Theyre making so much money tonight
 Hes about to
 Are his robes floating around him all cool
like a Nazgl
 Thats a less shitty roll
 All Im hearing in my head is Careless
Whisper now
 I mean we should take those out too
 Im going to pull out my symbol of the
youre with me right now because I really need
your help Im going to try to Turn Undead
 No Im going to jump up behind Frumpkin
  feet
 Wisdom save yes
 It has to make a wisdom saving throw yes
  succeeds
 Thats my action and for my bonus action
Im going to cast Sanctuary on whos the lowest
 On myself

 It was also the only wisp that wasnt
affected by the Turn Undead Where did that
confetti come from
 Oh I missed your welcome party
 Are you going to do your thing
 All the stuff
 Thats a good name for it
  Steal his heart Take his
heart
 Wait dont you have to make a wisdom
saving throw against my Sanctuary Because you did
a harmful spell against me right
 I didnt roll anything yet
 Ten
 Im unconscious
 Dont waste a healing potion on me
 I have healing packs in my bag
 I have doughnuts
  Molly
 This is a bad day you guys Today is
really hard
 I guess Ill walk over and try to take out
the pot
 Can I try to throw something at it
 Yeah I dont think I have anything that
will fit through that little hole I could try
picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at
it
 I probably dont see one If I did it
would take a whole lot of time
 Three
 No its fine
 I just woke up you guys
 Good job
 Oh no Hes back Okay we run away
 Grab his heart and run From the ground
 Lets run away
 Its a twohanded weapon I cant do it
 I cant use twohanded weapons
 Oh his bodys somewhere
 Maybe theres something behind the
bookcase
 Its immune to fire
 Can you catch fire to the bookcase
 Should I try to heal Yasha or move the
bookcase Im the strong one
 I can use my last spell I have a ndlevel
spell Im going to bonus action use Healing
Word at ndlevel on Yasha to bring her back and
then Im going to run over and try to crash the
bookcase down
 Six plus four Ten
 Can I get all the way over to the
bookcase
 I try to yank it over
 
 Is there anything behind it
 I bet its remains are in there Kill it
 I dont think I can do anything else
 Wait We should heal you guys Should we
take a short rest and heal up a little bit
 Oh Youre welcome You deserved it so
much You did so good
 Lets see Let me look in my possessions I
dont think I have any butter
 Is it pretty
 Can I look at the art Do I know the
artists
 I dont know whats going on
 Well thats not as cool
 Ooh theyre antique
 I put them in the bag How about that
 What is it
 Ive got an herbalism kit
 Can I use my herbalism kit to get rid of
the poison
 Thats 
 Are there any rings
 Caleb You should see if the rings are
magic
 It also includes the sword and the vases
 Can I try doing the Mending cantrip on it
Would that help
  Le le le le le
 Thats still cool
 Hey thats good
 Whoa
 What else does it
 Its a twohanded then because its a
great
 We could use it on notpeople as well
Maybe on objects
  Thats how you hold a
greatsword
 Oh its dark Is it cursed Does it feel
cursed
 So Siff didnt have any feet
 Do you think taking the sword off the wall
was what made Siff be able to come back
 Hmm
 At least were not dead you guys
 Oh We can put them on now Theyre not
magic
 I should get an extra one for healing you
for poison so thats two for me
 I get Calebs because hes not saying
anything Thats three for me
 How many is that Seven eight
 Yasha thats two rings left for you
 Or in your nose
 There has to be a hole in it for you
to be able to do that
 What is he writing
 No I didnt lose the page I lost the
whole spiral
 Yes well things moved for some reason
 Does anybody see a little
 Yeah because I need it
 Get evidence of something
 He may let us keep some of the spoils
 I bet theyre worth a lot of money though
Rich people love old things
 One ring
 Mine rules them all though
 I already took his ring so technically
Here
  I have two rings now still
 What about the sword
 I mean he probably cant even hold a
greatsword
 Its a little big for the Haversack
 Not quite so much Its only eight cubic
feet
 I dont think it works quite like that It
has to be a broken thing
 As long as there were no ashes in it
 Oh it wasnt an herbalism kit Im stupid
It wasnt an herbalism kit that could heal the
poison It was medicinal herbs Thats what I had
in my inventory that I remembered
 I definitely start drawing that in my
notebook
 You can keep a dream journal Thats a good
way to do it
 Write it down immediately what you
remember It really helps
 Are we going to tell him about the sword
 Only if he notices the sword
 I can try to fit it in the bag
 If it pierces its bad
 Rub some of the ash on it
 Like it can be up your butt
 I have some crossbow bolts and this
crowbar and the sledgehammer
 I have this longsword I have these old
vases that were going to give him I have this
old dodecahedron and I open up the lead box This
is really taking up a lot of space
 I start shoving it all back in
 We have boom sticks
 Im listening What
 It might work we can try to fit it
 Yeah does it have a scabbard
 We should probably get one of those made
 It works It doesnt get pierced from the
inside It can only be pierced from the outside right
 Yeah
 Its too big
 What if I take the sledgehammer out Ill
take the sledgehammer out
 Will it fit once I take the sledgehammer
out
 I dont think the sword is going to fucking
fit Here
 He probably thinks were dead you guys
 Oh man we should have tried to go through
that teleportation circle
 Yeah we should have tried harder
 Thank you for saving me Molly
 Thank you for saving me Fjord
 I have to go in the other boat
 It has been a really long day so far
 Or we go check out whats farther along
 Just a little bit
 I feel like this is stupid
 See you never
 If the current starts to pick up were
going to fight it and try to go back yes
 Yeah Oh I dont think it works that far
away from him
 Oh thats where the fork was It comes
back together
 Yeah keep going straight ahead
 Were turning back and going the other
way
 Constitution check Thats pretty good

 Oh no theres a waterfall
 Does it seem like there are any boats that
are broken at the bottom of it
 Is there anywhere to stop the boat
 I only rolled a ten
 Is the waterfall really hardcore Could we
see if theres anything behind the waterfall
 I try to get closer so that she can poke
through the waterfall
 Should we go
 Do you think its going to bludgeon us
 Oh youre going Youre jumping now
 Youre not going to try to get the boat
through
 I try to get the boat through
 I save the boat Okay I try to push off
and not sink the boat
 Jeez Oh much better
 
 I really want to go see whats behind the
waterfall but I dont want to lose the boat
 Well lose the boat if I jump out of the
boat
 Is there anything to tie the boat on
 Do you see anything on the other side
 Itll be like a cold peppermint drink
Itll be good
 It does because Ive been doing it at
home
 Did you find anything
  Okay
 I lift him up by his armpits

 Oh thats ooh
 Its a good place to hide though too
 Fjord even wet youre like 

 Right
 Fjord  No
 Its even better right
 Oh shit Im getting real tired you guys
Oh Im not Im not getting tired at all
actually 
 Do we want to long rest or go back
 Lets camp
 Just inside of the rock collapse
 It is Immediately
 Then yeah at the bottom
 Right before the staircase right inside
  Because he was in the water
before
 Sorry I want to bring this with me thats
all
 Yes we did a longy resty
 Are you all wet again
 No dampness
 Fjord you have a little something right
here
 Did you bite your lip
 Is that why Is it a sleep thing
 Is that why well you know
  Well I dont want to say
anything Im afraid it will offend him
  Well most of the halforcs
Ive seen have bigger tusks  Its okay
Fjord if you dont have a big tusk Its not a
big deal
 Its totally fine
  Just on the tusks
 Who
 It really is Do you still feel the same
way about your teeth
 You have to continue to do it
 Is that why you have blood on your mouth
Were you filing your teeth last night
 Is that nine
 No way
 The emotional poking was too much
 The guy in Tusk Love had them
 I think you would look fine either way
Fjord
 Im saying if you want to you would look
good that way as well You look good this way you
would look good that way
 Im good Warm blooded
 Nott on the sword
  Sword up the butt
  Yep straight up
  Just like a puppet
 If he notices it then he notices it if he
doesnt then he doesnt
 Im really good at lying
 Lets get in the boats
 Harder because therere things there
 Yeah Eyes on the side where the rock guys
were
 Oh no
 She rolled well This a strength check
 Five
 Oh Blessing of the Trickster sure On
you
 You get advantage
 
 To be fair I am rowing
  Im rowing a boat
  Thats a 
 Its because you went so fast through the
other area You have to pace yourself
 We killed stuff We are really badass
 No she said he was probably awake
 Well the Moontouched Sword is it small
enough to fit in the bag or is it
 
 Early in the morning
 Yeah so many willowisps Did you know
you just have to break a vase and you kill a willowisp
 Yeah this big cube came down from the
ceiling and it tried to eat us
 Its pretty scary
 Oh yes I pull out the vases Look at these
antiques
 Careful theyre very old
 I bet theyre worth a whole of money then
huh
 We found some candlesticks too
 It was seven I give one of the extra
rings
 Yeah I know
 
 I think we killed everything
 We see two rock creatures that were really
big but theyre really slow so bolt on past them
and they wont be able to catch you
 There were a lot of burned books
 Mostly be careful walking on them Youll
see them
 Theyre pretty obvious now
 Well there were two paths in the river
and the second path lead to a waterfall I dont
know what was at the top of the waterfall There
could be a chamber up there I dont know The
other side lead to the thing
 Is there anything else
 Were the worst
 We almost died
  I could look in my bag
 Do I believe him
 Is that an  or a 
   Yeah thats a  
 Hes being honest
 Were really good at that
 We have stuff to sell
 Should we go do that now or should we lay
low for a little bit and make sure that he doesnt
have anyone following us
 Lets go back to The Leaky Tap
 We do have some rings to sell I guess if
we wanted to
 Did you ever look at those chains Did you
look at the mantacles
 The mantacles To see if they were
magical
 We should probably stop going to
 Maybe not to Pumat Sol for a little bit
 Im sure
 You should probably take a bath
 Nott I know you dont like water but this
is an extreme version
 I think probably at least a damp towel
 Oh yeah there was something about that
 Yeah in the Victory Pit
 What happened to the children
 I start yelling out
 The third of the
Fessuran is the end of the harvest
 Hide your kids Hide your wife
 Theres a Victory Pit
 I have a lot of rings I should see if I
can get any good money for some of them
 I have some fancier rings though from
before
 That were stolen from your boss
 What happened to Sean Connery
 I want to scout out the Hearth of the
Allhammer the Ravens Den in the graveyard and
the Platinum House and see if theres a lot of
guards or if theres any of those that dont have
a lot of guards
 Is there any one that seems emptier than
other ones
 Could I try to get in there when nobodys
in there
 Can I get in my disguise kit and affix a
mustache onto her porcelain mask and put a wig on
her and then write across the bottom of it The
Traveler was here and leave a pamphlet
 I want to see as much as I can do in that
amount of time before anybody comes back
 Oh no Off to a good start Nine
 Oh hello yes
 There was a smudge on her face and I know
that the people get really pissed when theres
stuff on their statues I was trying to clean it
off for you
 I rub my arm across it to try and clean it
off
 I think I got it though Dont worry
 Im going to sit here and worship her now
Thats all
 Oh thatd be great
 Does that always happen when you pray to
this lady
 She does I know she does because she likes
me so much because I worship her real good
 You too
 Shit Damn it Is there anything to tuck a
pamphlet into
 Yeah Ill do that at least
 Yes Im going to try some other time
 I can do a medicine check Do you want me
to look at it
 I mean we could poison somebody later That
would be fun
 Like Legend
 Can I look at the stuff
 Wait what
 Im going to follow behind and throw
pebbles at them from behind
 Oh no
 Were following behind you guys right
here
 You guys looked like idiots just so you
know
 We need to get Nott cleaned up too
 Yeah Notts covered in ash
 Hey you want to see this map Youre not

 This is the Xhorhas side
 Ooh the Brokenveil Bluffs look scary
 Are you coming onto me
 Why do you have to do that Its pink Its
mine I paid for it
 Im not going to do anything Do you want
to hang out with me and then you can look in the
bag with me
 I dont know what youre talking about
 Theres a lot of people that inspect their
special packages You get to know yourself real
good Caleb

  Hello
  Hello Caleb Hello Nott
 Caleb and I have a date to talk about his
special package
 No were good I open up the haversack and
pull out the box
 Okay
 Okay
  Yes
 Thats probably good because people are
still looking for it probably so its probably
stupid that were fucking with it right now
 Yes Are you going to go all like tonal
sound while you look at it or are you going to
be normal
 Okay cool
 Totally game
 Okay
 Im looking at Caleb

 Oh okay
 Ive got his hand
  Oh no

  Lick it
 Did we hear him talking
 It means hes lucky again
 Did we get it too because we were holding
his hand
  Damn it
 Caleb we heard you talking though Are
you okay Caleb
 Uno dos tres Quatro
 I think he seems like hes pretty okay
though
 I dont know
 You could read it out loud you know
 If you read it out loud then well shut
up
 Thats right Then we can all be a team
 We can pass it around
 We could literally we could each of us
every day pass it to a different person and then
we could concentrate on it and we could have the
Fragment
 Why were you talking about your mom and
your dad though

 Was that a weird question Should I have
not asked that
 You said Mom and Dad I hope that I make
you proud
 and I dont disappoint you and stuff
and also gee whiz I should probably take baths
more often
 Well you were going to say that and then
the gray thing went into you
 Yeah thats what youre saying I remember
hearing that part

 If you ever want to talk about it you can
just come to us
 Were super good at talking both of us
 Tomorrow I want the thingy okay
 Youre right I am
  Oh my gods What if now that the
gray thing is in you the wizards in town will
be able to sense you
 Maybe you should be in the lead case
now
 Are you sure though
 The next day the gray thing will go in
someone else
 Or if like you really want to put a
mustache on a fucking statue
 Yeah just in case you ever wanted to do
that
 Your son is just the cutest
  Okay well goodnight then
 Goodnight Caleb If you need anything
Ill just be in another room
 Who was it
  Victory Pit
 A Mote of Possibility
 Well figure it out
 That was fun you guys
 Well struck my lord

 Well take it off
 Oh Thats the garrison over by the

 There could be
  times two is 
 That was amazing
 Im going to cast Thaumaturgy and start
Yasha Yasha Hopefully the crowd picks it up
 Yes Ive got one kit left so Im going to
use my medicinal herbs on you Beau to get rid of
the poison

of 
 Huh

now
 The only thing I have that can get rid of
poisoning is Lesser Restoration which I can cast

 Maybe the dice gods really want the charity
to do well
 Im going to Toll the Dead
 My invoked Jester is going to run around

 Invoke Duplicity I think lasts for I want
to say an hour but I dont know if it does
 Im going to go with me and you Molly on

and drag the giant lollipop out of the arena with me
 Is his hair long or short
 They looked pretty cool

 I use Thaumaturgy to say in the audience
The Mighty Nein are cooler still
 Throw some money instead
 Yeah
 Did you say all the politicians have
already left as well
 Oh okay Okay
 Heal Yasha too shes really low
 Yeah because they had a lot more people

really bad
 But a very tiny dick as was pointed out by
our friend Beau
 Theyre cute together
 Oh shes the one that we talked to
before
 The guy from the
 Have I ever seen an outfit like that
before
 
 Lady Fancypants McGee
 So nice to meet you
 Then the dude in the white robes
 We beat a spider
 Is everything okay Starosta You seem
rather stressed Im good at spotting these things
 The Leaky Tap
 Yeah Sometimes we stay at the Pillow
Trove you know
 Thank you so much What is your name
 She did tell us
 Were not going to die The war is very far
away from us
 We should steal everything
 I need time to go back to the Pillow Trove
you guys
 I like to think you did the entire fight
with it
 Well he pointed them out we should go
talk to them
 What should we say
 Thats actually true
 You want me to come too
 I can listen to the Starosta
 Youll be great Yasha
 Ask about the Xhorhasian that they fought
and then ask them how they do so much cool magic
Then ask them
 Ask them how they fly
 Youre not going to go too
 Oh jeez Im going to constantly stay
within a few feet of the Starosta but not in like
a weird way I just want to like overhear his
conversations and see if hes talking about war
and stuff
 Wisdom saving throw He just did Zone of
Truth on you
 Super cocked
 Oh I spelled it right
 Kryn is the empress of the drow you guys
 Im not here Im next to Starosta
 Is the Starosta still here
 Okay Im still there
 
 Id like to stop the Starosta before he
leaves the room
 Its the legal thing after oh no its
not
 The Dawnfather is legal here
 May I have a moment of your time before you
leave
 Fancypants yes
 Yes
 My friends call me Jester
 Well I couldnt help but notice your body
posture for this whole party has been rather
tense I dont know if you noticed but I am a bit
of a healer and Im from the Menagerie Coast
where I did a lot of mental healing as well as
body healing If theres anything you need to
relieve your stress Im very good at this This
is why I came here
 Im talking about somebody to talk to
 To relieve your mind of your stress
 I know you have people that work for you
 Or the Pillow Trove
 Okay I can help your mind You just
relieve that stress Its somebody to talk to
its very helpful
 Youre going to have the shits later
 Oh man you guys I was really trying to
get the Starosta to talk to me
 I am a healer Im a really good healer
 No I told him I didnt give him a price
actually
 That means Im really good is what that
means
 Not for friends
  Im actually really shit at
giving advice but dont tell anyone okay
 Well any time you have any problems
Yasha you just come to me okay
 I need to go by there anyway How long has
it been since weve been in town
 By this point my mom has probably got the
package here
 Yes I bet theres places in
 We could go to the Silken Terrace
 Why not
 Why do we need to go now
 Its late
 Thats probably because you just drank 
drinks
 Up early in the m Are we staying at the
Pillow Trove
 Did you guys divide the money up
 What did I get
 Yeah thats really cool
 I had the froyo because its healthier
 Good night Hello
 Have a pleasant evening
 I support you too in all of your endeavors
Nott
 Im giving Yasha a piggyback ride
 I like that you have a handle on your mug
but you dont use the handle
 Maybe do the thing you just did
 Shes gorgeous Hey that lady thats who
I was trying to look like that night you
remember when we were at the yeah
 Hi do you remember me I was here before
 You too Did you know we just won in the
Victory Pit
 Thank you were kind of famous now
 We think we might stay here tonight too
because we thought it would be nice for The Pillow
Trove to have famous people staying here for you
 It depends on what you want to offer us as
the Victories of the Victory Pit
 Oh yes but we would tell everybody we
stayed here all the time
 Im really bad at persuading people today
apparently
 Im doing a really bad job I have a
package probably here anyway so Im going to
check on that Ill let everybody else talk to you
about how famous we are now
 Thats it Four gold Do you know how much
she wanted to charge me before Im going to leave
it though because I am walking away Im at the
front desk
 Im going to see if my package is here from
my mom
 I blend in with my environment very often
Its common
 I have a package here probably
 Jester
 Oh yes that would be the one Im
expecting Thank you so much
 It came I guess See I told you my mom is
really cool you guys
 Oh my gosh
  Its probably a lot of money so
we should open it up in the rooms
 Oh here Of course of course Heres two
gold for you
 Im very wealthy now
 Now we dont have to worry about things
anymore you guys
 Not the best kind
 She has the best reputation you know
 Hmm Who does that
 Oh I do ease peoples minds
 Like a tall one or a short one
 What color eyes do you like the most Do
you want people with one color eye and the other
color eye like you
 Yes yes
  Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
 Do they still have those
 Okay when we get the money we should all
go out and buy new outfits and we should go have
a feast and maybe we can buy new clothes for the
horses too because I bet they would really like that
 Its for everyone I open up the box that
says my name right on it It says it right here
my name
 Its not as heavy as I expected it to be
 Thats probably what it is I have no idea
what that is
 Its probably platinum because its
lighter
 Ooh 
 Yes Shes really amazing Do you want me
to read it out loud
 Okay okay My darling Jester thats me
I do so hope your journeys have been safe
fruitful and wondrous Ive always wished you to
see the beauty of the world around us and while
the circumstances perhaps were not the most
favorable it has allowed you the freedom to
become your own woman
 I spent a lot of time inside I told you
this yes Okay To show all of Wildemount and
beyond the gifts you have to offer and the joys
you have to give My sweet girl how I miss you
I miss her too so much Your laughter your
energy Ive been sick in your absence Oh
because Im such a healer you know and I took
care of her so that makes me so sad But it is
the trial any mother must endure I suppose
Youre on your own now and while I will always
miss that little girl Im equally eager to see
the woman you will become Tensions here are less
but not absent Given time I hope things will
vanish into the past and you may come to see me
once more Until then I have included a small
trifle some things to keep you comfortable
creating and free I love you Your Ruby my
mama Marian Lavorre She doesnt tell many
people her real name you know
 Isnt it
 I love my mom so much
 Lets see what she sent us okay I open
the little package
 Do I recognize it
 It smells really nice Everybody really
likes this smell
 Blue green yes
 This is so I can keep painting I used up a
lot of the paint that I had at the festival
  gold
 That is a really good amount of money 
gold is a lot of money you guys
 Well I mean when we left you know I had
a lot more than that But you know its because
Im growing up and we probably are learning about
how to spend money better so shes teaching me
probably that  gold is not needed every
time
  I really thought there
was going to be more money in here
 I did I did tell her that
 But you know what thats totally fine 
gold is really generous of her
 Thats a really good idea
 It is a lot of money
 Caleb
 Im really sorry about that one time when
you were talking about money with me okay
 That is really great She sent my favorite
colors Red and blue and green and black Those
are my favorites to paint with
 You can mix them She knew I had a lot of
white already on me so I can make lots of
colors
 Well it doesnt work like that
 Do you guys want to split up the 
 That is true Im going to put this in a
special place so that we have it in case we need
it Okay
 Exactly This will be Moms Emergency
Fund
 Im going to paint that on the bag Moms
Emergency Fund
 Oh its in the room
 Can we hear Are we next door to this room
Can we hear whats happening
 I rolled a seven
 Can we hear
 Yashas in here too
 You said Message received
 Its weird
 You should try a different one
 We called down
 Oh okay
 Yes Tell them we want cookies and milk for
sure
 Oh thats right
 But Yasha likes to cook hers remember
 I dont know if they will cook rats here
though
 Most of the places that charge a lot of
money for rooms dont usually cook rats But they
do have other animals that they will cook for you
 Probably like a cow or a deer or an
owlbear or something
 What do you guys want to do in the room
now
 Jesus
 Bitch Fine bitch I didnt want to listen
anyway bitch
 Oh no we missed our stuff
 Well its fine We did We totally did
 Well I guess we should go back to the
Leaky Tap there and
 Oh yeah we can load it up
 You guys totally missed it We had the
best time in the room while you guys were gone
for a very long time
 We had a crazy orgy in our room and you
guys didnt even want to be part of it
 Oh you know Im lying
 Did you roll shit too
 Man
 Will they do that
 But then any city we go into wont they
lock us in that city
 
 You know what we should do You guys Why
dont we talk to Dolan about it He would tell us
 He was at the party last night He was with
that really cool guy from Marquet
 Lets go talk to Dolan
 Lets go talk to Dolan and then well
leave and well go to Hupperdook and then well
go to Nogvurot
 No because Hupperdook is a funny
sounding name Then Nogvurot is where our friends
from the other mercenary group live
 We can disguise you as a kid and they could
kidnap you and you could fight them from the
inside
 Of course Yasha
 We could ask Dolan about that too
 Can I say that while it was last night I
painted a picture with the new paint for my mom
 Im going to ask the front desk if they
will send it to her Back to our house in the
Menagerie Coast
 I mean I have paints I guess
 Okay Ill paint it with the stuff I have
 Ooh colored inks I didnt realize that
 Ooh
 Okay
 Why
 Well are we still all together or are we
already split up
 Theres no way well be able to get out of
here before
 Are we still
 I mean its obvious were at war now
Theres not much to talk to him about huh
 Maybe we should see if we should be some
armed guards for some rich people going across the
valley before so that we have you know
 Yeah thats what we can do while theyre
at the library
 Were going to go by the board first The
job board
 To see about being armed guards and then
were going to go to the
 Yeah of course we will
 Well we were right here
 Are we going to war
 Would we get healing potions
 We do appreciate the offer and we cant
wait to talk to our friends about it though
 What is it
 Why not It sounds like a lot of money for
something though
 If only my friend were here Me and my
friend Nott are really good at solving crimes
were the best investigators
 Okay
 Do you think the war will make it all the
way here
 If you ever need anyone to talk to because
you feel really stressed out Im here Im a good
healer mentally
 Whoa that was crazy
  gold What do you think it is Do
you think its a dragon or something crazy like that
 I feel like The Gentleman probably works
with the city you guys
 Back to The Leaky Tap then Get our stuff
together
 Yes he is
 And we count our fucking blessings
 Weve already left the city
 Anything
 It was great
 Molly told all of our fortunes
 We just pushed the giant rotting head out
of it and left it on the street
 Hey you guys I never used my fate thingy
yesterday because Im stupid Did you guys want to
use it today
 Oh did I not tell you about this thing Oh
my gosh you guys you know the weird little thing
that we stole
 Well it gives you this okay so you
focus on it and you go to this place and you can
see it and theres this little gray ball and it
goes Touch me and then you go Okay Then it
comes out and it goes in your chest and you get
control of your fate for one time in a day
 Well like basically like if you fuck up or
something like that then you get to fix it maybe
 No its like all of a sudden you feel a
little lucky maybe
 Lets hide next to the body that we just
killed so that you can try it in the cellar so
that nobody sees because we should probably be
careful pulling this thing out
 Yeah I pull out the box Just focus on it
Fjord Ill protect you
 I cant remember I think you just
 It can only do one person in a day but
well pass it around the group so if you want
it today Fjord then Yasha you can do it
tomorrow
 Did he say anything when he touched it
Like Caleb did
 Did you say anything No you were silent
the whole time
 No its just when Caleb did it he was
like I love you Mom and Dad Then he started
crying
 Yeah
 I close up the box I put it back in the
bag
 We will ride the cart Do you guys really
think we probably shouldnt become legionnaires then
 No We should leave town
 That ladys really nice though Shes like
a grandma
 I wonder how the contract works I bet its
like a magical contract or something like that
where you sign it and then they have like your
soul
 Oh that would be bad
 I bet he doesnt have any more yet
 We should have bought some earlier Do you
know of anyone else that would have some
 Right but seeing as how you dont have any
inventory
MATT There is Grace of the Wilds which is on the
southern side of the Pentamarket You can go ahead
and have Jasna Bree maybe help you there if the
army hasnt gotten to her first But I digress
Respectfully its going to be real difficult this
time of year
 To get healing potions
 This time of year like it happens every
year
 Are you going to go to war Pumat
 But youre such a powerful person dont
you think you would be helpful
 What was the pearl again
 I would like to buy that please thank
you
 Is it the Pearl of Power
 I had that as Vex
 Do you wear armor Yasha
 We already pushed the nasty head out of our
wagon
 Joining the city is protecting the city
more than it is joining the war
 But youre under contract for  gold a
week
 The big ones in Rexxentrum anyway
 If we stop by the merchants guild we may
still be able to be armored escorts for people
 Or we could just go
 Yeah lets not do that one
 Just be armored guards
 Oh I thought yes that was a given right
I mean we all work so well together
 We make really good roommates
 Did you want to swing by and see if Yeah
can we pop into the other shop The old Grace of
the Wild and see if they have any healing potions
just to check out
 Yeah
 Definitely be back in a week Wait do you
have any herbalism kits
 Oh great Could I buy some
 Would I be able to make potions of healing
with this
 Yeah
 Okay
 Oh great How many do you have
 I dont know how I would tell
 Oh then no Oh no I only have proficiency
with a forgery kit and a disguise kit
 No then fuck it I dont want that shit
 Can I ask a question
 With a healers kit can you heal people
when youre not in combat Or is it just for
stabilizing
 Oh okay Ill look at that
 Okay
 Ill do it
 Us three Oh That was bad
 Yes  Oh no Slightly better
Five
 Well I think wed have to wait Maybe we
should just go
 Well swing by and say sorry we are
declining
 I think we are probably not going to be
able to help out right now
 You really will
 After the what
 Whats a Hawker
 Like a monster or something
 From the Menagerie Coast
 The Menagerie Coast is really freaking
cool you guys
 Oh shit that sounds really cool
 What do you guys think Hold on can we
talk about this
 Pros we get to visit the Menagerie Coast
which is always really cool
 Do we have a time limit on when wed be
able to get him
 Makes sense
 Thats what they said
 Were really good at it
 What if we were like lets go after this
guy and then after that well talk about being
under contract Like this can be a test
situation
 No he ran away when he was a legionnaire
 The Myriad does some scary stuff you
guys
 How much of the bounty
 But if we were part of the contract then we
would get access to a bunch of stuff
 Can we decide can we talk about this
 This is where we hit the save point I
dont know
 Level five
 Oh gosh
 Oh Im rolling an eight as well
 Five
 Oh itll go Here let me get Over on
this side you can manage your levels
 My hit points are super low you guys
 He got Uncanny Dodge
 I think I get Revivify now
 I have Dispel Magic you guys
 Great so you can go back to the library
next time
  Too many options
 Holy shit you have so many hit points
 Yes I think we should go talk to him That
seems like it would be smart right
 Is it
 What if what he wants us to do means that
we have to stay here for a while though
 Like for a lot of money would you stay
 What if the table offers you four times the
amount youve ever seen
 Yeah I remember he was trapped down by the
spider
 The ones we made fun of
 Woo go Thed
 Im going to jump up on the table and watch
it
 Jump up on the table you can see better
 Finish him
 Does that happen often in here
 Fight me
 Fight me right now Do you want to do it
 Just hit each other
 You piece of shit
 
 Im going to punch her in the face and cast
Inflict Wounds
 At first level I could do it at third but
Im doing it at first
 Yeah
 
 Oh no
 d I think so
 
 I dont know
 Oh shit
 Yeah
 No it doesnt hit
 Normally 
 I should have done it rdlevel
 Oh god Oh no
 Five No Six Oh no
 I think I pooped myself a little
 That was my shield
 Yeah
 Oh no it hurts already
 Im going to use my reaction because Im
not stunned to use Hellish Rebuke on you
 Fuck
 Oh no
 Nope
 Aww no Im unconscious
 And then Caleb fucked me
  Whoa
 That was seriously awesome
 I would have done it worse but
I thought we were taking it easy on
each other and then you went crazy on me
 I understand completely How come you were
you hitting me so much though Because usually you
dont have that much speed
 That was a while ago
 Oh hi Frumpkin Youre a little evil
creature that drinks blood
 No its totally fine I did it to myself
 I dont like him That was creepy
 Im going to use this time talking to him
as a short rest
 Well hopefully
 Yes we have actually
 Like swap creatures
 Leading to Berleben
 Okay well the other side of that was that
we would get access to some potions and supplies
and stuff Is this something you can provide to us
when we go on missions for you
 Natural 

 I wipe a little blood from my mouth
 I think it sounds like fun
 Shadygrove
 No Shadycreek Well that would be probably
the second one right
 How do you feel about it Yasha
 Well I mean were all leaning more
towards this than going to the Menagerie Coast for
the Empire right
 That is as contracty as contract gets
  It does We can stop by
Hupperdook
 I have no idea
 I imagine that all of the buildings look
like mushrooms
 Yes We have to be careful of those
monsters that came out of the
 Its not sweat I think its
 Im going to peek around and look at the
Gentleman
 Eight
 What kind of shirt is he wearing
 The thing is if he was sweaty then why
would he be wearing long sleeves
 He doesnt look like hes warm though
Normally when people are sweaty theyre going like
 You know
 We go in we try to find Fabron Keyes and
secure the safehouse in the swamp and theres
howling there so probably wolves or something
 Secure it and come back and tell him where
it is
 Yeah so we need to go to Berleben or we
need to go to the swamp come back here and then go
 I think we should call them Dookies
 What are we going to do if hes not
 Exactly Wouldnt it be better if we just
dont know
 The Greying Wildlands are in the north
 I just want to make sure were here for a
full hour though Im going to drink slowly
 Im going to sip it
 I thought you get a point of exhaustion
after Haste
 Am I going to be able to heal enough what
 Ill just use the one little spell
 All of it
 Hmmmm
 Were going to do that one and then the
other one Well say yes to both
 Not quiet
 The passage that we were in
 Poison and healing got it
 You will get  gold
 Thank you
 Well one and then Oh I run back to The
Gentleman Should we come back here after the
first part or should we continue on and take care
of them both and then come tell you
 That way you know we did it timely and we
can get that bonus part
 Okay
 Yeah we already packed our rooms up
 No more Pumats
 As I leave I flick the Wand of Smiles at
him again
 Now I feel guilty
 Its cleared out
 We have horses you can ride a horse
 Two horses pulling the cart
 Five
 We have six horses
 Ill drive the cart
 Ill drive the cart
 When someone kicks him and he poofs does
he automatically go to the other place or does he
die for a little bit and come back
 My mother never did but the Traveler told
me lots of stories
 Of everywhere
 Theres faeries and that is how the
unicorns get over here
 Do you have wolves
 I bet someones going to try to jump out at
us
 They do that to people that are on the open
road
 Thats really shit
 We should probably pull over or something
and look around and see
 Thats a fast burn thats not going to
last very long
 We could camp on top of the cart because we
wont be on the ground its warmer on there
 Ill take first watch with him
 Yeah
 Its not awesome but its not horrible
 Im helm
 Oh goddamn it 
 That was an easy watch then
 What you guys I was at a disadvantage
 Were all camping together
 Oh you guys are still on your watch
 Its so brisk and wonderful
 Do you think The Gentleman wakes up with
frost on his face or his whole body
 I wonder if he has to crack himself
 He has to wash them every night They would
be so gross
 Hey Nott do you think were going to go by
your hometown when were driving up here
 Oh really
 So youre nomadic Do you have little huts
you put up as camping tents
 Did you like that
 I dont know Ive never tried it
 Is that why you left
 I saw you
 No
 I could tell you but I feel like its
offensive or something
 Well my mom used to tell me that if you
act up too much the goblins will come in the
middle of the night and steal you away
 Yeah
 And would you eat Because my mom said you
would eat them
 Did you ever eat a little child Nott
 Do you even know who your brothers and
sisters are
 Oh
 That sounds a little shitty Fjord
 Like what Maybe we do
 Everyone likes bacon Bacon is super good
 Yeah She doesnt want to hurt her baby
Caleb
 Is it into the woods or is it further
along
 Its a small shack
 Should we go knock on the door
 No well just keep going
 The shack is a mile away
 Can Frumpkin be a bird
 Not for me though Caleb hates me
 I want people to like me
 Youre checking out the shack
 Did you kill someone for that
 Great
 Maybe we should just live here instead of
going anywhere else
 Lets keep going
 Dont fuck this up Fjord
 Have you ever tried human before
 Im going to start making a nice pretty
bed in the cart Its going to be really nice looking
 For anyone who wants to stay in here with
me
 Then Im going to crumple them up
 Never mind
 What
 Or a sleep arrow
 At least we got a surprise attack Thats
good
 Oh my god theyre huge
 Wolves Goblins Oh shit balls
 You dont want to curse it right
 I was expecting another six
 They are goblins
 As Im lifting my shield the other one
gets underneath it
 Oh no Natural 
 Did I take damage from that one arrow
  hits the goblin
 He has  movement
  Caleb
 If I fucking waste one of my fucking
spells Caleb I rush over and I cast Cure
Wounds at ndlevel to heal Caleb
 That would be d plus four Oh thats 
plus eight so  points of healing
  Its not working I dont know
whats going on Im going to use my bonus
action
 Im going to use my bonus action to cast
Sacred Flame at the ogre that is attacking us
 Oh it is Im sorry I was thinking
because its a cantrip youre right
 Bonus action Theres not really anything I
can do is there
  Im going to try to drag Caleb
away from the fire behind Yasha
 Great
 Caleb fucking me again
 Natural 
 How much Eight and nine
 Thats  Wait no I think did I No I
did that wrong didnt I Shit balls Anyway
strength saving throws
 I got to close out of that Okay strength
 and 
 Im going to cast Hellish Rebuke in
response to one of the
 That would be  points of damage to him
 You stay away you piece of Its okay
 Youre still really cool looking though
 Thats what poison does You get
disadvantage on all your attacks if youre
poisoned
 That sucks
 Youre alive How did
 Whoa we need to get you some AC
 I saw one that was good and I was like
 Oh
no
 Okay Im going to cast Sacred Flame at the
wolf in front of me
 Its dex Sacred Flame
 Does not succeed
 d Oh five damage to him Dang it Then
Im going to cast for my bonus action Spiritual
Weapon
 Here Oh you have one I want it right in
front of me because I might as well have it crash
down on the wolf as well
 Okay That is 
 That is a d plus four thats nine points
of damage to the wolf
 Damn it
 Yeah because I cant move hell attack
me But hes going to attack me anyway
 He could attack Caleb though Hell
probably attack me Im going to stay right
there
 Oh no
 It happens Oh its magnets
 Ha
 Hit under his arm Hit his ribs like you
did with me Hit his ribs
 Hey
 Yeah 
  Drink of water
 Yeah Molly
 Are you an angel
 At home you mean You were the only one of
your family that had it
 
 Have you tried
 Okay
 What did you say
 Do you want us to leave the table
 Her face looks angry
 Just all of us staring at you
 I pull down my Spiritual Weapon and start
licking it
 Only the parts that hit the wolf and the
ogre
 Xhorhas
 Xhorhasian I think
 Hes a spy
 Are they wearing underwear
 
 Im going to draw that in my journal
 Oh my gods can you imagine what would have
happened if they were all over us when we woke up
 Did you hang out with ogres too
 Nott are you okay
 Was it weird to fight other goblins
 Oh You liked it
 What
 Oh you were Nott a torturer
 What happened to him
 Did you leave before he did
  Really
 Did you love him
 What was the distraction
 Thats good
 Wow
 But your goblin friends knew where the
village was
 Why But you helped him
 What if we cast Disguise Person on you and
you could find out if he was okay
 What if after we do this we go down there
and see
 We just killed two ogres and some wolves
and a bunch of other goblins We could probably do
some serious damage to your old mean tribe
 Just because you look like them doesnt
mean that you have to be like them
 Theres that creepy smile again Beau
 Maybe there is a comma
 Maybe not though
 Maybe some of them are nice like you
 In your tribe Have you gone to other
tribes
 Maybe you were just in a really shitty
tribe
 I dont know if we will all fit
 Im okay in the rain
 I am
 I need to sleep I got injured
 Im going to sleep
 Oh all right
 Yeah level six
 I walk around and crunch all of that frost

 I dont think so no
 Is it always full or it is always almost
empty
 You dont have to buy alcohol at all
anymore
 Thats wonderful
 How do you decide which alcohol is in it
 What if you get sick of it You cant empty
it out
 What if you want to try a different thing
like
 Yeah
 Maybe we shouldnt do that right before we
go to the swamp where were going to fight people
 You cant really waste it
 Maybe you should try
 I find a stick Open up
 I dont want to hurt your throat you
know
 But do you feel better though
 Do you want me to stick something down your
throat
 We beat them though
 Is it normally ogres that ambush you
 One more time
 That was very believable Caleb
 I think Ive ever seen
 Does anybody else want to drive the cart
today or do you want me to keep driving it
 Yeah
 Not the slowest pace
 A normal pace
 I want to stand on the cart and stand up
for the ride and look around
 Ill put my hands on Mollys horns and
 Am I rolling twice
 Nine Because its appropriate
 Ill sit down Ive been standing for such
a long time
 Plus if we wait itll take a really long
time for them to cross the road
 Lets go Go
 We should stand up and ride it like a
surfboard
 Yeah
 Did it break the wheel
 We could climb to the other side of the
cart and try to balance it so the wheel comes up
 Oh no is it fixable
 Would we know
 I have an axe
 Yeah and get all of our stuff off of the
cart But I have our giant lead safe in here
 Its pretty heavy
  I have Mending I have a Mending
cantrip
 I have that
 You guys I can mend things Thanks for
reminding me on that Molly
 Yeah I can try it
 Guys Im amazing
 That would have been way more amazing if
Id remembered that I could do this Let me try it
on this other wheel though
 No I think the army would see it
 We should look like were people that are
peasants or something
 No We needed help because our family is
in the swamp
 I push the safe off the cart
 I just bought it Its in the bag
 The good stuffs in my bag Dont worry
 Could you help us
 We are headed to this swamp place
 What does he look like
 Load or loat
 Max Load got it
 How long have you been a soldier
 Thank you so much for your help
 Do you need any help
 Thank you so much
 Stay safe
 Everybody be safe
 Actually it was faster than I expected
 Could I try Mending again and see if what
they did made it to where I can fix it now
 Oh no Im wise
  Wait thats a lie that was a save

 Traveler be with us
 Tada
 Thank you
 Right
 Yes
 You see that Caleb thats almost as
powerful as the shit that you do
 Have you seen my lollipop
 Dont make me Inflict Wounds on you Nott
 Yeah
 And kind of painful probably
 Well shit
 Youre not awake
 This is why we should have taken that circus
tent man
 Are there any caves nearby I mean were
kind of by a thing
 Did you guys wake us up because of the
storm Im assuming
 What is he looking for
 Oh its right there
 Were pretty far away
 Does that mean that guy was named after a
whole city Does that means he owns a city
 Oh I thought that was his last name
 Ill take the next watch because I dont
mind the rain
 Just regular plain old check
 Thats not bad 
 Big one did you see that
 Shit Storm
 Thats not that long of a walk quarter
mile
 Ah its like a day at the beach
 We should get some waxed canvas or
something
 There was a big one close by
 It happened right before I went to sleep
 Dont know
 Really
 So what kind of people
 So I should go
 Im going to go get some of it too
 Thats impossible You cant make something
like that
 I fixed a wheel
 I could do it because I can make a giant
lollipop
 I have lots of faith
 Is it considered faith if you just really like
somebody
 Oh
 No
 I want to ride on a horse today
 Ugh its going to suck even more because
of this storm
 Hey at least its cold so there wont be a
lot of bugs around Normally bugs are terrible in
swamps I hear
 Right
 Oh no and if you start to lose hope your
horse sinks into the mud and its gone forever
 Oh I thought there wouldnt be insects
because its cold
 Were trying to find Febron Keyes
 That sounds like it was talking or did
that sound like a bird
 Should we call back
 Maybe its just a bird
 Wheres it coming from What area

 Thank you Oskar I mean Fjord
 Yasha starts throwing up
 But were on horses
 Was it a snake
 I really want to see what it is Oh you

is here
 Maybe its a call
 But the safe house is in the swamp its
not in Berleben right
 Maybe we can climb a tree Are there any
tall trees
 Can I start climbing a tree
 Sure

 We need to protect you
 We cant leave her in the cart
 Just say no No Kiri no

booze
 Hi

 Hes a little bit high right now
 Can I look around at the few patrons that
are in here and see if any of them fit the
description of Febron Keyes
 That was a shitty roll Eight
 Can I get up close to them and one by one
 We heard amazing things about this area
and we thought we would check it out because
were travelers
 Yes and we like to see different sorts of
things and this is really an interesting area
You know not many cities have a lot of water in
them like this
 Its really coollooking though
 Downstairs
 Whoa that could be so much fun
 Is it submerged in water
 Thats a lot more than you originally made
it sound like
 Yeah sure why not
 Is there someone who can keep our cart Do
you have a place we can keep our cart
 Well yeah
 Keep it where Where
 Okay
 No Ill do it because I want to see the
town
 Sure
 No I can do it Yeah
 Wheres the stable

here
 Hes right here
 No we have to secure the safe house
 Lets go wake him up
 Just on his teeth
 Youre so intimidating Caleb Really

 Was it gators
 Oh well because we are really good at
killing those
 What if we paid you  coin
 All right We could do that

which kind of coin
  copper  silver okay  silver

 Thats one part of it taken care of
 All right
 Upon delivery to the place
 No its not its really not

were scared of us bringing you back to The
Gentleman What are you going to do
 And you sing us a song On the stage
 And
 
 Yeah Does everyone want to chip in a
little bit of gold
 This is like sorting out a check at the end
of a meal

 All right
 All right Heres your gold All of us
pulled together Now go sing your song Wait

 Margaritaville
 Wait are we leaving in the morning When

 No
 This is so cool
 Are there two beds in the rooms or is it
just one bed
 Time to snuggle up Beau
 Oh Kiris staying with us
 And you and Caleb
 Oh shit We need to take the cart to the
stables
 Oh shit Maybe we should have the guy take
it Or should we just leave it outside I think
thats a bad idea
 Okay yes well have Dent take it to the
stables
 Can I insight check him and make sure hes
going to be honest
 A natural one Hes the most trustworthy
guy Ive ever met in my entire life
 Yeah
 Okay heres a couple silver for you Thank
you
 Yeah
 Maximilian
 I think he was saying something that cute
guys sometimes say those kind of things
 Then later on in the book you run into him
again and he remembers you
 Then he takes off his helmet this time and
you see that hes got the most fabulous hair that
blows in the wind
 Captain Maximilian is probably like that
 He probably had the hots for you Beau
 Well no probably not
 Maybe it was Yasha
 Yeah Have you ever read Tusk Love Kiri
 You know what maybe Kiri shouldnt read
Tusk Love just yet
 Kiri how old are your parents
 You dont know how old they are
 How old are you compared to most people
that are like you
 I think that means shes pretty young
 Yes she does
 Your voice is very low Beau
 You kind of do sound like that
 Okay Im going to spend the evening
telling Kiri basically the story of Tusk Love
 But she doesnt have to read it I can
leave out the really dirty bits
 I tell her all about Oskar
 Its the most beautiful love story youve ever
heard in your entire life basically
 I draw pictures of it to illustrate what
Im talking about
 Leave that shit on
 Ew
 I like this place
 Smart
 Oh yeah
 We are
 Thats so sexy
 We wake up all cuddled in a pile in our
room
 A little cuddle pile
 You dont sleep with the daggers Kiri You
want to remove them
 We should have taught her that last night
 I would like so much of whatever you have
please thank you
 Ugh Thats a long time
 To the stables
 We run for it and we get the table first
 This table is taken by The Mighty Nein but
if you need anything theres other tables
this femininelooking figure Long black hair that
covers almost the entire side of her left face
wearing a hood up dark green cloak black and
green clothes you can occasionally see green
sorry to bother you guys just I couldnt help
but overhear some conversation you had last Im
sorry to be really forward Are you heading into
the swamp today
 I like your ribbons
 And she looks up at you
 Youre not
around
 Ive never seen anyone in a dragon mask
before
 And this is a bird
 She She walks around
 Shes kind of the best
 No Probably not so much like that
that can talk Is that your daughter
 And the green
then like the anyway Sorry Im getting
distracted from what you asked me That happens
sometimes Just give me a nudge and Ill get back
on track Theres something out in the swamp
Theres somewhere like a smugglers holdout or
like a storehouse I think maybe
 Mm Weird Thats crazy
 Yeah well anyway What it is that you
need with that though
looking for and I think its there and I need to get
it before some other people get it But Im not
stealing it Well I kind of am stealing it but
Im taking it back for a good reason
 Is it the people in the dragon masks that
want it
 Is it your underwear
 Its a soup bowl then
 Insight check Insight check
 A soup bowl used in rituals
 
 Hes incredibly trustworthy and he worships
like crazy
 Because hes had them wrapped around his
weenie
 Like a full dragon
 Well hes going to take us where we need
to go
 Shes Kiri
 They need more sugar here
 Gators Giant ones
But theres also something else I havent quite
seen it yet
 Cali did you hear any howling in the
swamp because we heard there were howling
monsters
 Jester Fancypants
 Just the one one nostril
its more acid But I can control some fire as well
 You know what I appreciate that youre so
accepting of everything Febron
 Trinkets are pretty great
 Yasha
 Ill write up a release form really fast
 Yes
 Arms being chopped off An axe to the face
I will illustrate being burned by fire
 Pulled apart by gators Probably something
creepy and howling eating you as well
 Im going to use the colored ink from my
mom to make it really gory
threatening to kill me because Im cursed Yeah
you all seem lovely really Youre much better
than most people I have to deal with to be
honest
 Here you go You can sign this

 All right we have a deal
 Welcome to The Mighty Nein
 Lots of pocket bacon
 Whoa its creepy
 Yeah Kill all of it Kill the fog Kiri
 I have to live with this for the rest of my
life
 Oh shit Kiri come back Kiri
back
 You have to be careful Theres lots of
creatures around that could hurt you you know
 We should really give her like a sheath or
something to put that knife away Fjord
 He has lots of fire
you do you
 I will
 Its fine Beau
 Im going to carry Kiri on my shoulders
 Yeah so that she doesnt have to walk
through the muck
 How does she know theres a J in your name
really
 Oh jeez Louise
 Its just milk
 We should avoid those huh
 Wow
 Dang it Im trying to get to my bag to
help you but
 I cant bend Whoa
 Yes
 Sacred Flame
 Dex save
 That was a dex check yes
 Toll the Dead
 Damn it
 We should really avoid those in the future
huh
 I would
 Woohoo 
  I hear something
 I hear a chime
 No like little wind chimes Like we
had at home
 Yeah
 We used to hang them in our balconies
 It sounded like that
 Febron is that where the thing is that
were going
 Oh so its not the safe house its
another building for sure
 We should find out what it is
 Thats cool
 Just in a tree
 Oh thats creepy
 Our wind chimes were made of wood
 Does Frumpkin see anything around like any
living things
 Do you want to hold my hand I try to hold
Calebs hand
 Lumpy Frumpy
 Its really good
 That pile was definitely something
sleeping
 What kind of bones
 Like gator bones maybe though
 I bet it was a friendly person
 Ill tell you what lets go to the safe
house and then well come back if we are not
completely almost dead and see what we see
there
 Especially if there is no bowl in the safe
house Then we know some other place to look for it
 Lets mark a tree
 Oh well find our way back
  Lets go to the safe house then
 Wait hold on let me look at what I have
I could cast Pass Without a Trace on anyone within
 feet of me
 Oh so it would be super slow
 Well maybe not then Maybe when we go back
to the creepy tree we can do that
 I open my journal and start drawing him as
a balloon
 
 Hey theres a lake
 Febron
 Are there monsters in this lake
 Okay
 
 Then I go back out I just wanted to see
 We just freeze
 Maybe I shouldnt move forward
 I stay right where I am
 What is it
 Maybe its something nice
 Whats happening
 Yeah right No sound at all
  What are you saying Beau
  Maybe theres lots of them around
too
 I will
 Got it
 I am a fan of pie Kiri
 We are keeping an eye on the troll
 The thing is what if something bad comes
in front of us and then they trap us Because hes
just following us
 Maybe he has friends ahead that hes
waiting on
 Its a friend
 I could if I made myself look like a little
teeny troll And they would want to be friends
with me
 What if we ran rope between a couple trees
and then we tripped it
 Man trolls are so cool
 Do you want me to do it Fjord
 Here you hold Kiri then because I dont
want her to get too close to it
 What are you doing Why are you holding
way
 Is the troll just watching all of you go
away
 Should I try to Pass Without a Trace you
guys
 I guess I will be falling back because Im
going to talk to him
 I thought the thing was behind us
 Okay Im going to pull the last of my
pastries which Im sure are really fucking gross
by now
 Im going to Invoke Duplicity and Im going
to send my duplicate towards the troll Its skipping
 Towards the trees looking like shes
picking some vegetation I doubt theres flowers
 But whatever Yeah Whatever she can do
 Im going to have her turn her back to the
troll and act like shes digging around in the mud
 Pretty close
 Im going to have her take a couple of
steps away from the tree
 Shes going to step back towards the tree
 Dont think it was friendly
 Yeah
 I think we should stick to the safe house
what do you guys think
 Ill keep the invoke duplicity the second
me skipping through the swamp at a distance
 Invoke Duplicity lasts I think a minute
yeah
 Beau needs to stop looking out for things
 Yeah Ill look
  I think Yeah
 Its right here its at eye level with
me
 Ooh thats better Thats a 
 That was a one for me I dont see it
 But I dont wander too far from everyone
else because theres a troll out there you guys
 I find that last one
 
 You havent gone past these
 Shh  They could be around Hey
you guys I could try this thing that Ive been
wanting to do for a while which is where I can
talk to somebody that is not alive anymore
 Yeah the Travelers teaching me all about
it and I think I can do it
 He kind of is but hes really powerful
and hes super cool
 He wears this really cool cloak and hes
got an amazing voice Actually hold on I pull
out one of my pamphlets Here if you want to
learn more you just let me know
 Yeah do you want me to try it
 Its instantaneous but I can talk to them
for about ten minutes or so
 Just one dead person that I cast it on
 It doesnt have to be fresh it could be
really old
 Which one looks friendlier
 I mean sure
 Okay
 Hi
 Im nervous Ive never done this before
 Okay Im going to hold my symbol of the
Traveler
 Im going to be like okay Im going to do
this thing
 Kiri be careful
 Hey you dead person hey I would like if
you would come to life again a little bit and tell
us some things that we want to know



 Well kind of
  We have to ask it some
questions
 What did this to you
 Really are you sure though Have you ever
talked to a dead person
 Beau are you writing this down
 How many swamp fishmen
 Many therere lots of them Therere lots
of them that attacked
 How long ago did this happen to you
 I get five of them
 Wow Two or three weeks ago Oh Did
anything that you did to the fishmen seem to hurt
them more than other things
 They bleed but theres too many bleeds
 I get one more question what should I
ask
 Dont kill it again okay Kiri Its okay
We have another question
 Or we could ask it what its childhood was
like
 Dont waste all your spells youve got to
fight fish men
 Oh hes huge
 Just stapled to the tree
 Technically
 Oh no
 
 Okay Im going to Toll the Dead because
hes been injured
 Im going to turn around and be like

 It is necrotic damage but he has to roll a
wisdom saving throw
 So d I can help search for those in a
second
 Six whole points
 He has a loud ringing in his ears damn
it
 Not flanked by Febron
 I wonder if Febron is going to get covered
in that pus thats coming out of him
 The ring
 Youre  feet within him
 Please dont waste all your stuff on this
guy because you know
 Yall dont get close to this guy because
I dont want to waste all my
 I think its okay because Im going to have
to use all my fucking spells healing you Beau
 Why dont you get back here
 
 Oh god please dont pick up Beau
 No Goddamn it
 without killing Beau because we cant
attack it
 No but what if it makes it pus its thing
and then it hits Beau and she dies
 Dont damage it
 Do you have a healing potion
 Can you just grapple it
 Potentially
  Oh so close
 Its going to keep running away from you
 Can I get within  feet of it
 Awesome Im going to cast Healing Word on
Beau
 As my bonus action Healing Word so you
regain d plus four hit points
 Seven points
 That was my bonus
 But I dont think I can do anything I
guess Ill hold an attack Ill hold
 Yeah Ill hold Sacred Flame until Beau is
dropped and far enough away
 Maybe
 Is she far enough away
so she can grab on
 Oh my god
 When she is far enough away I cast Sacred
Flame
Splash because that was a bonus because of
quickened
 Okay so you get hit with d
 Nine points
 We should just let him go huh
 No you get disadvantage
 Then get the fuck out of here
 Can you try and hold on to the branch
 I dont think hes going down with it
 But wed be idiots
 Oh theres a dead person Im talking to
 I turn around and run back to the dead
person
 Oh this isnt the safe house
 All right I guess thats what Ill ask it
then because thats all I can ask
 Sorry we got distracted there was a troll
that came and stole our guide I think you might
have known him Anyway which way is the actual
safe house that were trying to get to
 Oh shit We totally could have seen it
 Well at least we know its  feet so we
can search for it
 Do they have anything in their pockets
 Investigation you say 
 Im taking it
 Are you going to check if its magic
 Okay
 Im going to use Mending on the note Oh
wait it doesnt make the words come back
Remember we already figured this part out
 Shady grove I bet the Shady grove
 Im going to heal you
 Mmhmm My dead friend Yeah I think it
might be hidden or something
 Aw
 Probably
 Hey Cali can I ask you a question
 On check traps sorry
 This bowl that were looking for
 You said it was used in rituals
that its part of a set that I know this cult were
looking for and I want to stop them getting it
 Were you ever used in rituals with these
bowls
other rituals God this sounds really horrible to
say They werent nice people They kill people
and I kind of helped them because I didnt know
any better You got to remember Serissa the
priestess who raised me she told me all this
stuff about the Tyrant about the Queen and I
thought that that was just what the world was
like you know I thought that that was good and
she told me that these other people were bad and
thieves and that they were being killed for
righteous purpose
 Who were the bad people
 Oh I know about re No I dont know
anything about religion
 What kind of people
wanted and they wanted to take and they said it
was rightfully theirs But Ive learned that its
not anymore And yeah I helped them do that
Thats why I want to stop these bowls I want to
stop them doing this to other people
 They are super evil bowls
magically minor like a little bit magic but as
long as theyre not used by the wrong people they
should be fine
 I dont think being stuck inside makes you
naive I mean I know some people that were stuck
inside that know lots of things
like I need to learn a lot more you know So many
people treat me I ask if I can trust them they
say yes and then they trick me Or they use me to
do bad things
 Thats not okay
 I dont think the fish people like the safe
house being here
 Maybe this tree is sacred and it was being
used as a safe house and thats not okay
 Cali can you make this water around the
tree go away
do something about that Ill Shape Water and I
can push it around in a five foot cube so I can
part it a little bit Or I can turn it clear as well
 Oh no thats really impressive
 Caleb can you do that too
 He cant do it Nott
 Should we try to go towards the tree
Towards all the dead bodies
 Huh Damn
 Yes
 Are there any knots on the tree Like
underneath where the ribbon was
 Its right here
 
 Check for traps Nott
 Im going to move it then
 Well you and Beau and me did it
 Aww
 Right
 You can do light
 What if theres traps on the inside
though
 Cali youre so cool
 Thank you I love you
 Are there any trap doors on the floor
 Thats where the fish people live Are
there fish scales on the ground
 
 Fish skin
 Its tough
 Its kind of salty
 Smells like fish
 Im going to put it in my bag
 I just open up the bag so you can see it
 We dont let Cali see it Sorry Cali
 We should send a message to Nott and see
what she sees
 Lets climb down
 Thats not a long fall for a cat
 Can we start tying a rope off upstairs and
drop it down
 Weve tied our ropes together and were
going to go down
 What else are we going to do
 Why
 We cant leave Kiri up there Who knows
whats up there
 We had it upstairs Kiri
  Sit in this corner
  No Sit in the corner Kiri
right here
 Dont move unless something chases you
 Right
 Shes down here with us
 Right
 Yeah
 Lets kill the fish people
 Yeah
 What if we all jump out at the same time
and scream and attack at the same time
 Like three two one
 We shouldnt do explosive because
 Is this really the moment to talk about
this
 Oh jeez Were losing our ambush yall
 Ten
 Oh no
 And then we jump out
 Nobody Nobody huh
 Six
 I got ten
 Oh shit
 No like behind that little
 Hes dead hes dead Too late
 Sweet then they end their turn
 Oh god
 Thats what his spell is
 Just within range Until hes in range
 No remember You looked at this before
 But in the book it doesnt have darkvision
We did this last
 Damn Beaus big
 Okay Im going to run over behind
Frumpkin in that little alcove Actually thats
a lie Im going to go next to Caleb
 Yeah back a little bit
 Even more Then I am going to cast Invoke
Duplicity Im going to Invoke Duplicity Shes
going to run forward and stand next to Fjord
 Yeah because thats my action
close to
 Still pretty cool Beau still pretty
cool
 Theyre still inside the tentacles
 What are you at Fjord
 It touched the ground that means its
cursed now
 Hit one of its brothers
 Ill be able to fix him in a second
 Thats great
 Well not all terrible
 Im going to send Duplicity me towards
Fjord and shes in her illusion going to hug him
and cast Cure Wounds I will call from a distance
going Dont worry Fjord youll be okay Ill
cast it at level two
 So  points
 Then Im going to use my bonus action to
cast Spiritual Weapon right over top of the other
fish man in the back there
  plus something so I think that hits
 So that is d plus four Force damage so
eight force damage
 Do you get one more hit
 Wait did you say it fell into the hole
 Dont let it go into the hole
 Lets get this guy out of the tunnel in
case somebody comes through the tunnel I dont
want anyone to see him right away
 Me and Yasha basically got it out
 You did it You killed them
 Its a light die Its not like a heavy one
that wouldnt be affected by the magnet
  silver you said
 Okay Well do some math
 Do you see any diamonds Do you see 
gold worth of diamonds
 You said four sets of manacles
 Really people dont like it when you do
these things Sam
 I wanted to look in the pools too
 They were coming from somewhere Who knows
there could be  of them on the other side of this
 Were supposed to secure the safehouse
 So anyway
 I feel like we should check and see if
theres  of them on the other side of this thing
 Yeah one person that can breathe really
well Fjord you are familiar with the sea Can
you hold your breath for a long time
 All right How about you go
 Should we take a short rest again Oh its
another hour
 Oh you can only do it once a day
 Youre low on health still arent you
 Im going to cast Cure Wounds on you if
were not going to take short rest if were not
going to take a short rest
 On the other side
 This makes me feel so uncomfortable
 Oh my god are you okay
 What if the safehouse is that other tunnel
What if this whole thing is the safehouse
 Im okay with that
 I just cant believe we didnt find that
bowl for you
good in the outside world and I thought that I
found it here but Its fine
 Why dont you want me to come here
please
 Whatever
  Caleb you found the bowl Im so
proud of you
 Yeah Kiris proud of you too
 What difference does it make
 You dont have it in your hand anymore
Caleb
 I dont think you should stop someone from
talking to a god if they want to talk to a god
that clear
 I believe you Cali I dont think I need to
cast it on you
 Oh Well I can cast Charm Person
the guide right To make him tell the truth Do
that on me I wont resist it I promise
 Not all of us are shitty
 Cali be careful Theres trolls out there
and gators
 Superduper
 Oh my god I will send all the letters
Cali

time okay
 Hugs hugs hugs

 Im going to take that as a long time
 Okay good Im going to tell you if
someone asks what your name is you say I am Kiri

start

friends though and theyre all going to come back
 Probably
 Oh no What if it digs up a hole in another
area you guys

 Well what if youre cursed now How do we
know youre going to be okay You have a weird
thing inside of you
 Maybe hes alive and you were seeing
through his eyes right now
 Maybe theres more than one
  I feel like somethings going to
attack us
 Maybe mermaids rescued you
 Maybe youre a mermaid and you dont know
 What was the explosion you talked about
 Oh man thats totally weird
 That was the whole reason they attacked
was what if they attack you now

 We solved the mystery
 Hes coughing up salt water again

merrow people
 Oh man wait but Oh okay
 I wanted to check out those bodies that
were downstairs
 No the human skeletons that were down
 They had manacles on them though didnt
they That means they were slaves or something
 Blowing up a cave I guess

 Wait can we all hold our attacks for as
soon as the troll comes out of the tree

Can I search the body
 
 Hey Nott I found some pickled muscle for
you
 The slimy kind
 Man my medicine checks are sucking Ten
 Its probably human

his junk and wrap it around the heart because

 Do what you have to
 Are you okay Fjord You died twice

be cool with it
 Lets start walking
 We did it

message to The Gentleman

swamp we killed that too and we also found some
crocodiles Please respond to this If you need
anything let us know okay
 And your agent out here the guy with the
no teeth is dead
 He interrupted me while I was telling him
what we did
 Yeah there was so much more but I think
he got the idea Well get the bonus
 Yeah he seemed like he was doing pretty
good when we saw him
 You know what it might be because I think
they decided to charge other people with the
crimes and stuff
 Were they still though Are they
 I dont remember
 Horris do you have a lot of diamonds on
you Maybe some that are worth  gold
 Im on the lookout okay
 Poisonous troll hearts
 Man Im glad hes alive I thought he was
one of the dead bodies we found at the safe house
 He went in the apothecary And I take off
running
 I have a troll heart Its full of poison
 Do I roll with advantage because Molly is
helping
 
 We killed a troll
 Do you want to see it
 I open the leather and place it down

 Hey
 There are a lot of aortas and chambers and
stuff
 Probably you could buy it and also give us
some stuff
 Really strong ones
 Is that regular Or stronger than that
 But Im more interested in the healing
potions
 Take the troll whats your name by the
way
 Smithe Durban
 No
 Nope Im taking it with me
 What a nice guy
 I did I liked him a lot
 Thanks Fjord
 I saved his life multiple times today

take her
 Oh Thats surprising 
  Its Tusk Love Thats
definitely Tusk Love

 Yeah theyre at the docks or something
 He dropped them off at the place
 The central stables we have to ask where
they are We dont have to go back to the other
pub Dont worry Fjord
 Kids huh Theyre always wandering off
 They look like a troll took a shit in them
 She doesnt like us very much
 Does it look like a T with a U with an S
with a K With an L
 You got this Yasha
 I have a book you can read Yasha
 I feel like we only need three rooms
 Wait before I go to sleep I want to use
my Pearl of Power and regain a rdlevel spell

 Why not
 Oh man
 We cant just let her go
 What if I try to get a hold of her parents
or something
 We cant just what are we going to do
Just send her on her way by herself
 Okay

  I hope so
 Maybe I can talk to her and have her write
down exactly what her parents look like or
something and I can try to send a message to them
 Theyre birds
 Right here
 Whats the gold stuff in there
 Whats the stuff that swirled around when
you put it on the table
 What is that

 I think that sounds like a pretty cool
deal

problems with the  and then theres
potions that can help with that
 My mom said

 Hey youve got our stuff
 Thats not surprising
 Yeza
 Was he the halfling guy
 Aw
 While everyones figuring it out

 So wed pass by Hupperdook
 But Rexxentrum is the capital
 We should probably stay clear and go to
Hupperdook
 That Trent guy
 Tell you what well go Hupperdook on the way
up and then we can do Rexxentrum on the way back
 Gnome parties
 And they live in mushroom houses
 Insight check
 
 Thats amazing
 We have a carriage lets stay on the
roads
 Like a flea market town
 Its an outlet outside of town
 I bet I can get  gold worth of diamonds
for way less
 Which by the way I want to talk to you
guys Heres the thing this spell that I have
takes diamonds in order to bring you back to
life I dont have enough gold to buy all these
diamonds for everybody so
 Well yeah Or if you want to be selfish
about it you can buy your own diamonds and then
Ill use those for you
 Doesnt matter its just  gold worth of
diamonds but theyre going to be gone if you die
 You keep your diamonds on you
 Yeah
 No You have your own diamond pocket and
then when I save you itll be like
 Sounds good to me
 We just pop out the diamonds We can still
keep ruby jewelry and emerald jewelry
 Just diamonds
 Whats that about How come he gets to keep
his
 Well maybe he can fly I dont know
Sometimes hes invisible could it be hes flying
next to me I dont know
 Could we maybe keep the diamonds
 While were going I need to sit next to
Kiri and Im going to pull out my sketchbook and
Im going to ask her to write down everything she
can think of about her mom and dad and draw a
little picture of them because Im going to try
to do Sending for her mom and dad
 Thats about how I pictured them
 So they were going the opposite direction
that we are
 That sucks
 I take a little paintbrush and I draw a
smiley face on the rock
 Theyre not dead
 I like how this is like Final Fantasy
traveling
 Lets roll individual ones
 Oh 
 That would be funny
 Pineapple
 If you got a thicker cloak it would look
real good with it
 Do you buy stuff as well or do you only
sell stuff
 Ive got a gator skin
 Super fresh
 We should probably tan this I leave the
tent
 Are we trying to do a covered wagon
 No keep saying it maybe hell start
rolling better
 Im heading back to the cart spreading out
the leather hides and making them dry out
 No its not its a ballerina
 Wait Should I have asked if Kiri was cold
Do you get cold Kiri
 Do you get cold Yes Or No
 You get cold Oh I run back in and try to
get some warm clothes for Kiri
 Something really pretty though
 Okay
 Can we see
 That was impressive 
 Do they look like fancy wagons
 Maybe we should ask
 Have you been to Hupperdook
 Did you see the mushroom houses
 Damn it
 No  Where are you going Are you
safe
 I look at one of the kids  Are
you safe Are you good Are you safe
 I dont know I feel like they wouldve
said if they were in danger or something
 Yeah Im afraid its like I dont know
I just feel like somebodys not safe there
 Okay Okay
 Ask whats happening at their home
 Nogvurot Oh thats where the people have
been getting stolen from People are getting
stolen remember
 Oh okay so we can sort of avoid
 We should avoid Nogvurot right now
 After weve already taken care of the stuff
so we get paid Do we know how much time we have
left before our time is up with the Gentlemans
timeline
 And we have a month
 Okay This is going to be the hard stuff
now
 Her eyes are like the sea
 
 Natural 
 Im going to Invoke Duplicity
 And Im going to send her out next to
Molly
 Do you guys have healing potions because
you just sent a lot of arrows at Nott I mean at
this I mean
 You know the drill
 Take off your pants and walk away
 I rolled a one No pants for me
 They said they wouldnt be bandits anymore
but they are bandits
 Yeah dont go working for criminals
Thats stupid
 Oh Then if youre going to do bad things
at least work for somebody whos rich and doing
bad things Dont just steal from people on the
road thats stupid
 Only steal from grumpy people
 Youre going to steal his money and hes
got medical problems
 Do I have to heal him now
 Dont kill this corpse Dont stab this
corpse
 I know but shell think it is
 No way
 Thats so terrible
 I got pants
 Im going to add it because I think I
already have some bandit pants
 He knows where their hideout is hes
fine
 Hell be fine hes a bandit
 What if we put some flowers in his hair so
when he wakes up he looks really pretty
 Theres blankets We can take the
blankets
 Molly they have a covered wagon
 Or we can take theirs and leave ours
 We should take the grain for our horses
 This is not how I pictured it
 Is it mostly gnomes that live in the city
 Does it look like the buildings are teeny
 
  We should be going to the city
 I guess well ride into the city
 Blushing Tankard tavern
 Alliteration
 Hold the elevator
 It will be fun
 We are guests here
 Thats what we are Were guests of
Hupperdook
 Hupperdook
 Yes That one
 Oh man Come on I really want to be on
it Come on man Let us get on man
 It was a firecracker thats all
 Well we could have if this guy he would
have listened to us because we are really
important people
 Were the Mighty Nein
 We thought the name was funny
 We might as well be wearing fanny packs
All of us
 Like an amazing fanny haversack
 Im going to keep an eye on her because I
think shes going to try to steal some of our stuff
 Beau you make really bad first
impressions too Shes basically you
 Are you saying you are crazy I mean you
did that in front of everybody Are we having an
agreement
 Oh I can see that about you
 Is it sooty up here too
 Do you live on a high floor or a low
floor
 Less stairs
 Do you build the machines down there
 This is a party town
 The Blushing Tankard Is that where we were
going
 It was a tavern Rissa
 Theres a big party happening now
 Wha Should we Should we party
 Why
 No its cool
 
 I was going to write dick
 I didnt
 I like this town
 Because why
 Oh
 Lead the way
 Fjord
 That means that her sleight of hand is
better than your perception Thats all it means
 Beau get me some too Beau Get me some
too
 Oh no Im get  Is that for me
Beau its beautiful
 Wait I guess itd have to be like this
Its beautiful
 I think thats smart
 Would I have seen fireworks before in
Nicodranas
 Lets go inside
 You think its safe I dont think its
safe
 Hey Nott have you ever been dancing
before
 Yeah
 Okay just making sure
 I figure were going to dance tonight
  We probably should We should
probably get Kiri involved
 Come on Kiri
 This place is great
 I want to go try to play the piano
 Yes
 Ive played it a little bit at home
 I have a lot of really good songs that I
learned when I was growing up Im going to sit
down and try to play Chopsticks
 Oh yeah its an eight
 
 Did you say she was a dwarf
 I want to start playing The Entertainer
 This is a really good piano
 You should be really proud its yours
 Do you have a tip jar
 I really think the first couple tips should
be to me because I really set up the room for you
 Fabulous
 Did you see
 I run over and give Caleb a kiss on the
cheek Thank you Caleb
 I love that you did it
 Where did Yasha go
 There are four rooms
 So Molly can have a room all to his own if
he really wants to you know  
 Is it allowed in other bars
 I use my tail to
 I was going to smack him on the ass with my
tail at the same time
 Ill do the other one
 Its sad really
 No stay play with us longer
 Wait So your dad is what rich or
something
 Its nothing to be ashamed of Its okay if
he is
 What kind of stuff does he make
 Can we meet him
 Okay
 Yes of course work thats what were
doing
 Oh yes
 I was really hoping you would have houses
of mushrooms Do you have any
 No I just thought Hupperdook sounded like
a mushroom sort of town
 Im going to stop though
 I toss a silver
 I think we can do it
 We can have her stand on one shoulder
each
 Ill be on my knees Then we can do these
things Kiri can have a ribbon and shell do this
while we do it
 Its basically the same as what they just
did
 Every night
 We should probably do that For this I
would make an exception
 How much
 How much do people usually contribute
 Are you a big drinker Rissa
 We cant put her to bed
 Because shell just come out of the room
Wont you Kiri
 Because theres so much noise and stuff
 Yes you are very sweet
 She would come out of the room I know her
 I dont think thats a bad idea
 What did she say
 What did she say
 Thats it
 Why do we need three people to watch Kiri
 Kiri are you cool with staying with Yasha
for the whole night
 Do you promise you wont try to leave her
and you wont try to come out and find us
 I dont think it is either Kiri
 Oh I just love her so much
 You be good
 Oh thats right Now me and Caleb will do
it You stand on our shoulders You wave the ribbon
 Have you ever danced Caleb
  You have I cant picture you
dancing
 But Caleb we want to dance with you
 Well figure it out
 Youre very dexterous and I think youll be
a very good dancer
 Plus you have already lots of scarves on
you so you can do a lot of the things
the people were doing
 Yeah So should we dance in the street
 You know heres the thing Hes already
been with the Ruby of the Sea so probably nothing
you do could compare to that Kind of sad
really
 I know As soon as I said it it was really
creepy
 But you know what It was just a power
play and it didnt really work out
 Yeah but people that have slept with my
mom are really rich and really powerful usually
so its a compliment for them
 Yeah I could sit in the room and let you
know if theyre any good or not
 Oh thats pretty good
 Have you ever paid for anybody before
 Why did you give them money though
 I want to look for flowers too then
 Well you should show me sometime because
I want to see it
 We can do it when nobodys watching okay
 Im really good at the waltz
 Yeah They taught me the same time I
learned piano
 So many Lots of skills
 I can paint Im really good at baking
scones Specifically scones
 With cinnamon
 I know Its a very tough recipe but Im
good at it
 Yes
 The third thing is something that I want to
talk to Fjord about Because if hes that
inexperienced then maybe he should take some
lessons or something
 Thats true
 No It really was more of a learning sort
of thing
 Yes Its all about studying
 Ill go put my nose next to his nose on the
glass What are we looking for
 Are there any silk flowers I was looking
for those
 Shut up 
 I hop over next to her  Ive been
looking everywhere for you

 How much is a flower
 A copper apiece

dad take good care of you
 Are you a good dad
 I think that I dont know I wasnt
counting

You know I happen to have a little girl with me
who is very cool and I think she would like to
play with you

her over and you could play together tomorrow

Wand of Smiles as we walk by them
 That guy knows
 Ah

 I stomp back down the stairs and I join
them

silver

 Directly in front of Valkin we start

 
 I want to cast Mirror Image on myself in
front of her Whats her name
 Tanya and wiggle to make it look like her
visions starting to double
 Oh no thats bad Yeah that was the goal
Eight
 Whoaoaoa
 Wait we can win money from this thing
 I thought we only got tokens or something
for free drinks
 Aw no fuck it Lets just do it without
that deal Double or nothing Go Nott Yeah
 All my mirror images are like yeah
Drink
 Youve got it Nott
 Are you under Disguise Self
 Woo
 What No You got this Nott Im going to
cast Bless
 I think it gives you advantage on saving
throws Is this a saving throw
 But I cast it on you
 You guys look like shit
 There are yes
 Is there money involved here
 I take five because I gave Molly five
 We do have an extra room
 Do you guys need to go to bed or
something
 You sound pretty normal actually Nott
 Im going to ask Caleb to waltz with me
 Astrid
 Oh well you know Caleb
 Caleb do you need to go to sleep
 No no no I grab his jacket
 You are not going to go pass out in the
street You told me to be in charge of this I
walk him upstairs and makes sure he gets in bed
 Yes I am and you are very nice and a
little stinky
 Im sure Astrid loves you very much I tuck
him in
 She tried to shave her
 Sober Im doing ribbon dances in the
bedroom
 What
 Your money is gone Is my money still on
me
 I still have my money What happened to
yours
 You should really spread it out Beau
Thats really not good Should we go looking for
it Maybe you dropped it under the bed Can I
start looking around the room
 
 I think somebody might have taken it from
you
 Oh no I wonder if thats a common thing
when people get drunk like that
 Irena
 Hey I knock on the doors really loud
Check your coin purses

 Make sure you have your money still
 What about Caleb Does Caleb have his
money
 What about your diamond
 Me Why would I steal your money
 That is really dumb
 So it had to be somebody that seems
inconspicuous walking around the room and
stealing peoples money
 Kiri I think shed be noticeable
downstairs taking peoples money
 I might be able to help us Also there was
this little girl who seemed really sweet but she
was walking around inconspicuously throughout the
room and maybe she did it
 Maybe we should ask Irena if it happens
often when these things go on
 Oh yes I have a spell that can locate
objects
 Well I could locate potentially a money
purse
 Its on this wand yes
 It was only the five who got stupid
drunk
 We should find out if Blemmys crew also
got stolen from Do we remember if Blemmys crew
hung around the tavern afterwards
 Okay
 I still have money
 It has to be within a thousand feet and it
only lasts for ten minutes
 A thousand Which is not that far
 What if I cast Zone of Truth on Irena
 But how will we know if shes telling the
truth She seems shady as fuck
 Yeah I dont like her at all
 I think Fjord should do it
 The affected creature is aware of the
spell Always
 We go looking for Irena I think she did
it
 Rissa did it
 We should get them at the same table and
ask them questions because they have to be within
 feet of me
 Oh good point
 With my money Ill buy you guys breakfast
 Irena
 Irena did you see anybody taking all of
our money last night
 Does it happen all the time when people do
this drinking game
 Wait what did you guys do with our cart
 Would you have woken up in your drunken
stupor
 Yeah we go look at the cart Is it still
there and protected
 Shouldve left our money in the cart
 Im going back in the tavern
 Irena what about the little girl
 Theres a little girl that was walking
around last night that was asking for money and stuff
 She doesnt steal things
 Im going to cast Zone of Truth
 Charisma
 
 What are you talking about
 Oh I dont think you need to do that Im
just you know curious about what happened last
night if you have ever seen any shady figures in
here
 Do you know of anyone who wouldve stolen
coins from people
 Did you steal the money
 Im just checking Do you know who stole
our money
 Hey Rissa come here for a second

like super duper
 Weimar
 Yeah well go and Ill cast Locate Object
and maybe well just pass by something
 Pocket bacon Before we leave I ask Irena
whos still in the Zone of Truth are you really
interested in Fjord or are you just flirting with
him because it makes you some money and stuff
 Oh Okay Thank you I cast Locate Object
on the coins
 It lasts for ten minutes What if its in
the tavern still
 I feel like well walk faster than the cart

 Cleff or Cliff
 Your shop is beautiful

 Were really strong
 All of our money was stolen All of their
money was stolen I was sober

still drunk arent you
 Vampires zombies

 Okay okay okay
 Steelbringers Forge

money But I dont think I did it to those
 Well I have really good paint you know

 That too No wait because they didnt
steal my money
 I have a whole pouch full of money you
guys right here
 Big pouch
 Dr Seuss meets
 You said the waterfall goes up a thousand
feet
 And the apartments dont go as high as
that
 So if I got in the middle of the area and
cast Locate Object it would do a really big
radius It would reach at least the top of the
buildings
 Okay
 Should I cast Locate Object while were
walking around
 Yeah I mean if I use up all my spells
today as like this kind of thing
 I can
 The drinking coins right
 Cast spell
  Ah I turn around and start running
towards it
 It was Duncan

going to lose time on the thing for The Gentleman
 Insight check
 Sorry Do I think hes lying

now
 Okay What are we doing
 All right

prison and say well take care of the automaton

set the parents free
 As long as we give him some notice I think
it will be okay
 Ooh good point

hundred platinum was One half of it With the
other being paid upon recovery of the cloven
crystal I think thats what this thing is It is
imperative that you find this bauble and return it
to me It has great sentimental value to me and my
family This rendering should suffice to guide the
discerning eyes of your hunters
 Quenpillar

 And then he said something about Astrid
 Was it his girlfriend
 Hes very handsome especially when he
shaves You can see the little butt chin he has
Its really nice
 Me too
 I run in
 You shouldnt call them arcane copies
They have their own personalities and their own
self You should appreciate them
 Well all right but I think each and every
one of you is unique in your own way and you
should really appreciate it
 I go back to rearranging the shelf
 Bye Prime
 He does have a point there
 Its like they were specially made for you
Beau You have to buy them I think you should
charge her more
 I feel like youre a very specialized sort
of buyer is all
 Oh you should give her a deal
 Im sorry I got confused
 Caleb save  gold because we need
diamonds
 I remember you asking him for incense
before from him I think
 Maybe
 I can do that for you
 I pick up something and throw it across the
room
 I also might want to buy weapons if you
have a weapon that is also really cool and stuff
 Are we going to get it fixed Or can I
still stab people with the broken part
 What does it do
 Well I mean Ill look at it I dont
know Its pretty brokenlooking
 Oh my goodness
 Thats a very exciting thing Oh thats
expensive Seems like something you could hold
 Thats pretty cool
 Question
 Is there anywhere else around town I could
get an enchanted weapon of some sort
 But everybody else has really cool weapons
and I just have an axe
 How much would that cost
 Something that makes me really cool
 That would make me hit really hard and
probably open wounds that dont close ever and
maybe poison people and also turn them into
candy
 Yeah you know really bad wounds also it
really hurts a lot and it makes people turn pink
and also it makes people like start dancing and
stuff
 Seems like a really reasonable price for
all those things
 What about just one of those enchantments
What about it just makes people start dancing
 They go Yeah and they cant stop Its
like it would be really hard for them to stop
 Oh my god that would be so cool
 I feel like that would be harder
 Maybe I could decorate it to look like
candy
 I dont have that much either Wait do I
 No I dont
 How much
 Ooh That sounds way better
 Whoa Okay Ill do that
 Here take this one
 Its an axe
 Its a handaxe
 Ooh Yes it can
 Yep
 Sweet
 Okay
 I mean we should get that right
 Longswords arent simple weapons so I
cant
 Yeah
 Ill help you get the cloak
 Ooh yeah and you would give us a deal if
we bought a whole bunch of stuff
 Sure All of us save  gold still pretty
good

 Yes and then another two because Im going
in halvsies on the cloak
 With the dust of deliciousness is that one

 He left while we were shopping
 No I am not done
 Well because I want to make the Traveler
like me again because obviously he doesnt and
thats why he didnt come save me Im going to
use these two weeks to scout out all of the
temples to the other gods and really see the guard
schedules and the priest schedules and try to
sneak in Ill probably enlist the help of Nott
here
 Because youre good at sneaking
 This is true
 Before we do this this will be extra
helpful for you
 Just check it out
 Well imagine its a lot bigger than that
 It does say rouge doesnt it
 Put it on I bet it changes size when you
put it on because most magical things do
 And then were going to go and try to sneak
in and really fuck up
 How much time do we have What
 You owe us nothing
 You have nothing
 I already fucked with that one
 Seems like theres a lot of guards there
 Ooh yeah lets do that one because its
close to the bathhouse
 Well thats just fitting isnt it No
Im going to do the Platinum Dragon because its
next to the bathhouse
 No
 What does it look like
 Were checking out during the day you
know like were visitors
 

 How often does he come back
 And then he gives his sermon during the
next day and the next day We scout it out a
couple days in a row to really get the feel for
the guards
 With advantage because Notts helping me
 Oh Jesus H Macy Nine Nein
 Wow
 Im going to take some of the firecrackers
we got from Hupperdook and I want to set them off
during his sermon And then I want to but Im
going to Invoke Duplicity so it looks like Im
actually still there listening to the sermon Then
while thats happening but Im also Disguise
Self so I also want to look like somebody else
while its happening so nobody can trace it back
to me
 This is really good stuff And then I want
to run over to is there a big statue of the
Platinum Dragon
 This is a really bad time to do this
because theres lots of people around Can I do
it at night Is there less people at night Would
I have learned at least that much
 Okay I come back a second time after
setting up the fireworks Now the next time
 We have to do it right This time Im
coming prepared with my paints and a mustache
 My Anarchists Cookbook a couple brochures
for the Traveler and I steal Cads straw hat that
he bought sorry and yeah were going to make
the Platinum Dragon look like a really cool
farmer
 Yeah thats what I do Is it stupid or
something
 No if somebody comes in you need to
distract them okay Dont let anybody see me
because this might take a while
 Youre the distraction I also Invoke
Duplicity to where it looks like Im still there
on the outside and I can also be hanging out with
you so you dont look like a random person
 The old woman that was in the other yeah
 Ooh no You know what I should disguise
myself as The sermon guy Yeah
 Get them out
 Yeah distract them and make them go away
 You know what you should say say that the
sermon guy whoever I am tell them I need some
quiet time in the temple
 Natural  natural 
 Oh you really shouldve taken that potion
beforehand

some quiet time alone in the temple tonight

Dragon

 Ooh you know what I could just knock this
down That could be really good too

 My notebook I dont know what happened to

performs
 Oh yeah

off in the water
 Oh yeah
 You know Nott you also have that fabulous
ring You could just walk out onto the ocean
 Maybe you should find out
 That is true

 We went to a town and it was burned down
and we killed a bunch of gnolls and we took off
their ears Then we went to another city and we
fought these fish people in this swamp and it was
really crazy Oh my gosh you should meet this
monk girl that I know Shes crazy and she fights
with her fists and also with a staff and shes
really strong Theres this other girl who has
wings And I tell her all about it
 Fighting so much you should see how strong
Ive gotten
 Well I mean okay Do you want me to punch
you
 You look beautiful Mama
 Oh right I cant disguise myself anymore
though Can I borrow a cloak or something
 Shit
 Okay thats all that Ill do Ill cast it
again
 All my spell slots Okay I run back
downstairs
 Shes almost ready Shes so beautiful
 Yeah no of course she was
 Sure Yes of course she is Yeah
 No Ive never seen them before Have you
eaten any of this cheese Its really good
 Oh Thank you
 I told you I was rich
 Do you tip here
 I never really get to watch from down
here
 I see it Yeah nice
 Good luck
 Isnt she wonderful
 Turn your fucking thing away from me
Its hurting my heart
 I know
 Oh I dont know We never counted it
 Well I mean she lives here
 But she gets paid for other things and the
tips from the singing The singing pulls in the
other things You know what I mean
 Thats her Thaumaturgy
 I do I make the lights flare just a little
bit
 Keep your pants on
 Are you all in love with her now
 Well yeah she sang to me all the time
 Sometimes Mostly it was just her though
 Be that pretty and graceful and sing
really good and have a bunch of people think
shes wonderful
 No of course not I like myself just the
way I am
 Thanks Beau
 Thanks Fjord When did you hear me sing
 Oh thats right I did sing for you
Youre welcome
 Yeah big scary dude
 Well of course Usually after the
performance is taken by other things
  He probably got turned away
because my mom was already taken
 Its kind of a wait list but usually she
only has you know a few patrons during any given
period of time So shell have the best diplomats
that come to town and if theyve claimed that time
then they can spend time with her for an entire
week or even more and nobody else will come to see
her You know what I mean
 Sometimes Theres a lot of people that
want to marry her and have tried to court her and
stuff like that But she only ever you know said
yes to my dad
 Yeah theres lot of security guards around
here unfortunately
 It would usually you know shed come
tuck me into bed late at night afterwards
Sometimes I would already be asleep but shed
come in and say Im just saying good night to
you love Then she would go and then wed wake
up and sometimes wed have breakfast but
sometimes we wouldnt and then sometimes she was
gone for a few days at a time because the people
here they dont really want to know about their
daughters or anything like that So I would stay
hidden she would tell me to and then sometimes
shed be free and then we could have lunch or
something
 I can send a message or tell you what
Im not going to waste a spell slot Im just
going to run upstairs and tell Nadine to not
disturb my mom but to ask if its okay if I come
by tomorrow maybe

power Its my last rdlevel spell Okay Hello
Gentleman This is Jester Please respond Just

 Yeah he told Mama he was in the ocean
 Decades Holy shit
 Of course I know how old I am Im just
questioning my moms math is all
 I stretch
 Not a freebie
 Goodnight Mama
 Well kind of stupid for not thinking to
ask The Gentleman when we met him but
 I did think it was fun that we were meeting
somebody else who was blue
 Are there

 Why would I need a swim
 Oh
 Really
 Its actually pretty dangerous to go
through the Skews at night
 Theyre not webbed What if hes my dad
you guys
 Is that bad that I put that out there
 Ill just send him messages every day
 Its going to be so long before we go back
to Zadash maybe
 Okay
 I guess so Its pretty late
 Yeah sure
 Just that he was very charming and that he
wore lots of rings on his fingers and that you know
 Well that he lived on an island in the
sea And they were going to get married He said
he wanted to and he went to prepare his house and
never came back She thought maybe something bad
happened to him
 But she said he was very charming and very
sweet and very funny He always made her laugh
 I am Shes really wonderful isnt she
 We should go to sleep
 Great I slept really good
 That he stops
 Okay
 Okay whats your idea

 Okay
 Yeah why are we talking to the
Wharfmaster

without anyone knowing that we killed his guards
and we let the guy go
 What if he goes in to like a protection
service or something
 Thats true
 I mean we werent even going to attack if
he hadnt attacked us in the first place
 I dont want him to get revenge on my
mother
 Can we make it seem like Algar was the one
who did all this
 Like maybe he turned
 No
 Well because I heard Tracy say that she
was staying at the fancy the Lavish Chateau
 Oh good call
 What if we send him out to sea Dont
necessarily kill him but make him leave and then
make it seem like he was the one that did
everything
 Worst case scenario we kill him
 Oh okay yes I will disguise myself as a
tortle but not the that guy we met like a tortle

 We didnt know that already
 We didnt know she was the captain
 We didnt know what her ship was about
Lets go downstairs Maybe we can find something useful
 Ill follow him
 I think it was fun Honestly I think it
was terrible but it was cool
 Think about when we got our flying carpet
Like we didnt mean to get the flying carpet We
ended up bringing the entire tower down upon
ourselves right
 Who knows
 Yay
 Well think about nobody that saw us in the
city saw us taking the boat lived to tell the
tale Just kidding all of the guards right there
did
 I was on my way down right when I stuck an
axe in the back of a guys head
 I accidentally stuck an axe in the back of
a guys head I didnt mean to though I was
aiming for his shoulder
 I can do that
 I dont know if I have it prepared
though
 I do have it prepared
 Hes not dead
 Im out of spells
 Is it like a puncture wound Can I cast
 No no no I hold onto his ankles
 I know its really terrible Im sorry that
I did this I hope youre okay
 I mean I can cast Spare the Dying but hes
already not

 Well I think you know maybe Deuce could
do something about it
 Yeah See if hell come down here for a
moment
 Dont move the axe What if his brain
starts leaking out Dont do it
 Thats so messed up
 He got an axe in his head
 Yeah see
 Oh hi bud
 Thank you
 So we have this ship now but I just wanted
The Mighty Nein All your friends are gone right
now but its because you attacked us first really
 No see Thats okay I understand
following orders
 Hmm
 What were you guys doing
 Thats it
 No I dont want to do that That was
really sad
 Thats so terrible
 Yeah I think that seems like something
were going to do
 Who do you work for
 He attacked us first you know
 Oh really Why
 I like it
 Yes we did
 Is there some stuff you didnt get to
 What was the message you were trying to
get
 Do you see it Caleb Do you see it
 Do you think Mending would help fix that
or would it make the piece of paper come together
 Mending
 Okay
 If we drop you off are you going to change
your name or something Are you afraid Avantika is
going to come and kill you
 No you go You go next
 Like the ball Is it the ball
 Docktow
 Whats that
 Is that what this is Swavain Islands
 Why does it say Y Y Y Y
 Because its on the other side of the
reef
 On the hunt for ancient relics
 Only two will find out
 Thats the island Thats where the island
is then
 Whats your name
 Gallan
 I like your name
 Have you heard of The Traveler Gallan
 Have you heard of The Traveler
 Do you want maybe a brochure I could tell
you about him
 You could spread his name wherever you go
 All right
 What does she look like
 You should be important
 Yeah
 Do you know how to sail
 What
 We should change the name
 Like Mysterious Ball The Mysterious Ball
 The Mistake
 Does it
 I dont want to ride around in The Shit
 You just draw it you dont live in it
 Man you did a really good job with what
you were told to do
 Well okay Im going to go upstairs
 Hes not tied up
 I will take that
 Its okay
 Temporarily
 If you jump overboard well jump after
you and well bring you back
 Congratulations
 Yeah I dont feel doing that Maybe you
should just go upstairs
 Hmm okay Im just going to tie your hands
while youre sleeping though okay
 All right
 Poor guy
 What was his actual name
 Hi
 That guy who I stuck an ax in is actually
still alive
 Yeah Caduceus saved his life and hes
really nice Hes a pretty nice fellow
 Well Caleb did technically
 Yes shes very religious and is interested
in relics
 Maybe she just likes to collect things
 He said that they were mysterious and her
whole crew had some sort of magicy stuff
 Imagine if you swallow another one how
powerful would you become
 Those are the arrows are the pingpong
points that you have to hit and then you get to
the island that you
 He said it was bad
 He didnt make it sound like thats the one
that
 Avantika Who knows really It could be
Avanteeka
 Well try not to I really should sleep if
were going to do that though
 We should really figure it out I wonder if
in the morning we can ask Gallan about it maybe
he knows one of those sound familiar
 Well let me go downstairs and wake him
up
 Would we get there in two weeks Because
thats how much food we have
 And sea monsters
 And my mom and our puppy
 We should definitely talk about it
 That is a really good question
 Stealing comes with a pretty hefty fine So
does killing people
 I walk over to Caduceus
 Um hello
 I sit down crosslegged in front of him
 How are you
 It has
 Hmm Wow no I dont think I ever have
had a plan
 What is your plan
 What was your mission
 Like how Do you sometimes hear things
 Well A lot of times I think that maybe the
Traveler has left me and I think maybe things are
going poorly and he doesnt like me anymore but
sometimes hell just show up after a while and
tell me that I was on the right path all along
and he just made it fun for me to find it again
 Youre not afraid of death are you
 Breathe
 The world is a lot bigger than your
cemetery There are a lot of things for you to
see and you have to break out of your comfort
zone in order to find the path that you are
looking for
 Just keep doing that
 You cant smell dead people when youre on
the ocean
 Yeah
 Yes
 Do you want to make some food We have a
 Lets go
 Thats good for scurvy
 That sounds so lovely
 Should we go up for the meeting and then
come back down
 Oh sweet Well bring up and give people
food while we have our meeting
 Spicy fruit Its spicy fruit
 Super disguised
 Port Damalis all the way up at the top We
could just stop at the next city up
 Port Zoon
 That is a lot of time though to get
there
 Are we seriously considering bringing the
ship right back to Nicodranas
 How much did you make when you were
 I guess I could maybe can I try to cast
Mending on the sail and see if it looks like the
burn damage goes away
 Maybe I can paint something on the sail so
it looks like a different boat
 We dont ever mention ourselves
 We could just sleep before all this stuff
happens because damn
 It probably has already spread
 Can we just sleep Im so tired
 Can we go to sleep even if were just
sailing around
 Theyre going to see us
 Theyll see us when it gets lighter
 Im going to go sleep okay bye
 Found a carpenter
 Plus it was dark when we left and nobody
saw the
 Good thing we changed it to The Mistake
  Guess what I can do I can make
things
 Fjord can tell me what they look like
 To Fjordie
 Is it painted on or is it chipped on
 I can do that
 Well we dont have to unfurl it
 Okay Ill rewrite the name at least on
the side of the ship
 Yasha hold my ankles
 Im holding paint
 Yes
 Im dipping because Im hanging
upsidedown
 We should disguise ourselves

going in and stuff

food for the thing

worst Are you worried about where were going

to hurt okay

but then he never came back
 I would like for her to be happy I would
like for him to love her I dont know I would
like for her to not have to work anymore

 I shove a bunch of the fruit in my pockets
on the way out Is that better
 It depends is it a fullycocked rifle

 Oh but Oh because she would also
swallow so she would know that her
weapon would have it

 Right

 Or are you going to become like a god or
something
 Can I look around and see if theres any
peepholes in the walls or anything
 
 Okay
 Um no
 Wait wait Caleb what if you use your
antisink bubble
 I can use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like
theres ominous whispers all around
 Can we create white noise
 Well some of us actually saw it
 Can Caduceus and I use our Thaumaturgy to
make ominous whispers all around us so that its
like white noise so that we can whisper inside
 Yeah thats what we do Constantly Well
trade off so its like
Krakatoa
 All of mine are just playing the penis
game
  Penis penis penis
 Penis
 Oh my god what if theres that many other
eyeballs You can like swallow them all and then
you become like ultra powerful
 I think you get a wish
 I do
 In your heart
  Does that mean she swallowed one
too I mean like really though does she have one
inside of her
  If theres multiple ones What if
she has more than one and shes more powerful
than you

 Fjord Are you lying
 Ah come on
 I rolled a fucking one
 I had this dream that I was walking in this
field and then there was this banana tree right in
front of me and I climbed it and I got some
bananas and then they turned bad really fast
 Yeah so I think it had something to do
with that
 Then the grass was purple and then this
guy came up to me and he was like Whoa I just
heard but then his face turned into an eagle
and he flew away What do you think it means
 Okay
 Oui
 These lizard and snake people
 Did they seem nice
 Did you see any snake and lizard women and
children
 All right
 I just wanted to know if they had happy
families thats all you know
 But what do they do for fun
 Have you run into these people before
Fjord

cloak
 You could get a 
 Hes getting Vampiric Touch That means
hell get to heal a little bit
 Yeah Totally
 How about Yasha Did Yasha roll
 I dream
 Oh I spit on you with that
 Fjord gets it
 Keep hitting me
 Aw should have focused on the dagger
 Did we win
 We can do the bubble here and have this
wall take up some of the bubble space or we can
be right next to this wall
 Im going to do it to you too
 Well move over to where our bubble was
before how about that
 I was sleeping Did you notice
 Yeah he was holding his light up really
bright and seeing if he could find any words and
stuff I think they might notice some light
 Its okay Were learning things
 A good night of sleep will do you very
well
 Or snake legs or snake arms or snake
dicks
 Into the bubble
 I bring Sprinkle out from inside my hood
and make sure he was okay during that whole fight
 I give him some water and some little
food
 Im sorry buddy 
 Caleb I whisper in his ear
 Make it poop
Make it poop on her hat
 What are you talking about
 Make it poop on her finger
 But you can hear things
  Oh no
 On the way because I got a pretty good
amount of sleep during that fight can I ask
 Could we stick things through the bubble
 Okay just checking
 Im not going to Caleb
 Well that was for Caduceus Dont worry
about it okay
 Of course I promise Im going to stay in
here
 Good night
 
 Have you ever seen those cat things
before
 Yeah were pretty loud sometimes
 Have you thought at all about the
Traveler
 Do you want a pamphlet
  The Traveler
 Hes everywhere
 Hes really great Ill give you a
pamphlet I get it out and I walk it over to him Here
 Just read it over Theres a lot of
information in there Its really important
 Hes here right now
 Traveler If youre here you should show
him youre here so that he will like you even more
than he already does Just give it a minute
 He has cast his blessing upon us
 How long have you been working for Captain
Avantika
 Do you like her a lot
 What were you doing before you were working
for her
 Whats the craziest thing youve ever
done
 Im from the Menagerie Coast actually
 So that far
 Ever In my life
 Oh shit Ive seen some crazy shit This
one time I saw a bug carrying a piece of bread
that was like five times its size and he was
carrying it up stairs Like up and then he would
turn and then it would go up and then he would
turn
 Me too
  Oh shit
  If they stab through
  I put my hand on Fjords leg
 Shh
  I poke Beau
 Is it getting light yet
 We should wake up Everybody should wake
up We should get out of here before they come
back with more people
 There were I think I couldnt tell They
were shadowy but I think they were like lizard
men or snake men
 Could you tell
 Which ones The lizard men or the snake
men
 We should get out of here even though the
lizard men are obviously the weaker of the two Caleb
 We should get up and get out of here
 Should we make the brush look like we
werent sleeping on it and stuff
 You know so that they wont be able to
like
 Okay good great

 I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us
again
 Whoa
 What does it say
 Ill be right back
 Keep going
 Yeah
 You rolled with advantage right
 I didnt
 
 Oh thats fucked up What do the obelisk
eyes look like
 Eight
 Okay
 Oh dang we were going to pass it around
 Okay Fjord
 Stare at it Look into its eyes
 Look into its eyes
 Should we try to
 Okay you havent been around her as much
when she tells you dont do something well
usually dont do it but okay thats weird
 Shes hiding that shes actually not okay
 Oh no
 Oh Im sorry I was wrong
 shes just a
bitch
 Oh no Beau
 You must have caught something from weird
bugs
 Oh you got malaria
 Oh no Beau Im just not going to stand
near you okay
 So its got a lizard face Not like a human
face with a really long neck
 Like the Beetlejuice part where his head
goes
 This city without being seen Theres a big
group of us
 Can we make ourselves look like the snake
people
 Whats wrong with that
 Hey you two can you make yourself look
like snake people
 Can you be invisible
 But still we move really stealthily
 I dont think she can do it like we think
 Maybe we do separate into smaller groups
and try to stealth it
 Oh my god okay
 Thats a really good point
 What if we dont make a distraction We
make them look like prisoners we still try to be
sneaky but then if were caught then we have an
excuse
 I think they will probably try to
 I think they might try to kill us and then
eat us like that guy over there
 Well you guys arent as stealthy without
being within  feet of me
 What if do any of the people we see
walking around do any of them wear cloaks
 
 But there are some people that look just
like people
 I will use my disguise kit and try to make
it look like theyve got scales on them They will
probably know the people in their own fucking
village though Lets be honest
 
 Disguise Self
 Eight
 Okay thats way better 
 Now that Im seeing how good I did on Beau
Im realizing how shitty Caleb is but Im not
going to tell him
 Okay okay Oh
 This ones from Sam
 You look amazing Its a really good color
on you
 What do you mean she looks bad I think she
looks really good Caleb
 Just because hes dead doesnt mean hes a
bad guy
 Yes of course I am
 Hes pretty cool
 You feel okay now
 Well now we just have to go walk around
snake people and not be seen so thats fine
 But you cant hear whats on the other side
when youre popping in and out can you Oh yes
you can Thats right you can
 We should probably get pretty snaking on
here
 In the middle
 You guys we should probably do it again
  Pass pass pass papass I give
Yasha the Blessing of the Trickster
 I would say lets text her but shes in
another country so she probably wouldnt get it
 At least I look like a snake person
 Because hes distracted
 The other one has no guys
 Okay I follow your lead captain
 Because I rolled a shitty stealth thats
why Oh no
  Natural 
 Just to be clear
 I always thought that a T
intersection was an intersection like this
 No no no I get it I just wanted to make
sure
 Okay
 Ooh
 Oh No Yasha cant
 Big money Okay okay 
 I cast Hold Person
 Sorry I already said it At rdlevel
 Yes
 We should tie them up and then go

 Lets go Lets walk quickly
 I really shouldve charmed them instead of
held them but lets go
 Grab them
 Grab them slit their throats
 Is there anybody in there
 Inside
 Wrap them up
 Okay tie them up as much as we can and
then gag their mouths Toss them in a corner
 
 Were already tying him
 Yeah
 But we were putting things into their
mouths
 Wouldnt that still make noise
 Cover him up

 Thatd be smart
 A lot huh
 I can do it
 Oh these big giant pieces of wood that we
carry around with us all the time
 Coins though We would make them
 You motherfucker that was me
 What if we get the weapons off the
priestesses and put them in the holes
 Then you could do that
 It would keep them from coming up through
it as long as it was blocking yes
 Yeah so we could shove a sword in there

 This is so fucked up Im into it
 Oh god
 Well how about I just drag the bodies
over I start dragging the body over and shoving
an arm in the hole
 Im pushing them

paintbrushes and stick it in the holes in the
ground and swirl it around

eyeballs

 Go Beau Youre so cool You should lead
it
 Me
 Yes
 Beau Im going to give you Blessing of the
Trickster right in front of you
 
 This is where the warden lives
  Has it been more than ten
minutes since the fight
  Okay just checking
  I feel like we should spring an
attack on him
  I feel like we should spring
an attack on him
 Im pulling out the little keg of black
powder that Nott stole from the pirate ship
 Fluffernutter
 Were whispering all of this very quietly
 We could Fireball it
  Another person could be
invisible
  I could have the keg Yeah or
I could be invisible go in and touch him and
cast Inflict Wounds
 It does a lot of damage if it hits
 Its d and its heavy
 I could Invoke Duplicity in there and then
Inflict Wounds with my duplicate
 She cant carry anything
 Ill duplicate in and Inflict Wounds
 I can make my duplicate silent
 Yeah its a duplicate Its not going to
touch anything really Its a hologram its an illusion
 We already did it today
 Okay
 At the same time
 Yeah so that he doesnt see it coming
 Lets do it Okay
 Would I know if when I cast my duplicate
does it make a sound
 Its not a loser Its really cool
 Or go around it it doesnt have to go
across the water
 Does it look like its got its eyes
closed
 
 Okay
 Okay Im going to Invoke Duplicity
 Okay She can move up to  feet so shes
going to float silently and be on yeah behind
it so it doesnt see it
 Yes
 Okay Then Im going to cue Nott and at the
same time Im going to Inflict Wounds rdlevel
You can shoot them at the same time One two
three go
 At advantage
 Okay wait got to look at my spell
 Okay thats good plus seven is
  plus seven is 
 
 
 Times two  times two
 Well isnt it because its a sneak attack
 Oh Im thinking sorry
 Critical hit Youre right sorry
  points
 Yeah right
 Oh
 I feel like we won a slot machine
 Stop 
 Oh no
 At me But I couldve hidden or something
 Thats my armor class
 Oh good It misses me
 Does that reach the creature
 We wont see anything into it though
because its just black
 Wow
 Oh Thank you Caduceus
 Nine

 Yes I was watching when he walked around
the pillar so I saw where he went
 Im going to send my duplicate backwards a
few steps and hold out her hand and hope that she
touches him
 Yeah
 Yeah
 At rdlevel
 Ah fuck me It doesnt hit Nine
 Man sucks Okay Thats fine
 Theyre really pretty right
 Oh and Im going to move around the corner
so that he cant fucking shoot arrows at me
 Yeah
 Shit
 We havent gotten to the False Serpent yet
this is the Warden
 We couldnt even kill the stupid little
snake guy how are we going to kill a hydra
 So stupid
 We didnt even see the heads come out we
just see the heads pop out of this bubble of blackness
 Can you flank it
 Travis your face was just like Thats
the most amazing face you just made
 It landed three It got five attacks
 Yeah
 Is Yasha raging
 Oh
 No way you can actually pop off a head
 I like it
 It needs burning damage or else its

 Okay Im going to move my duplicate
outside of the tentacles close to the shitty guy
that I was fighting before
 Oh I have to keep a visual
 It is the case I didnt think about the
fact when it was in there that I dont have visual
on it I would have lost it before I ever cast
that other spell
 Oh jesus I dont know if works like that
 Okay then
 Oh can I move around the corner Then see
it
 I cant move it at all
 Great cool That was an awesome
 Yeah it happens I cant move my duplicate
out of the darkness
 Can I move it over to Beau Can I see that
area over next to Beau
 Yeah
 Or just like in front of the well
 Okay well at least its out I guess right
now Ill just do jesus christ Guiding Bolt at
stlevel on the hydra
 
  points of radiant and then next attack
gets advantage on it
 Then I move out I move back
 Oh yeah Advantage she gets advantage on
the next hit
 One attack
 Should I do it
 Should I do it
 Nott told me to do this
 Fluffernutter
 I throw it But I throw it high
 Towards the heads
 Shut up Dont curse it 
 Were almost in sync here
 That didnt go as well as I had hoped
 For my bonus action Im going to move my
duplicate out and stand next to Avantika
 She cant really do anything because I used
my action Shes just going to stare at Avantika
 Im going to hide around the corner and for
my move the rest of my movement
 Whoa
 Now we have to burn the head with the
aww it wouldve been so great if we wouldve succeeded
 We have to burn the heads
 We could do it like Hercules and just keep
making it reproduce
 Yeah its wet
 The keg is wet
 Thats true
 I know
 
 Did you double the Hex dice too
 I know but all I have is radiant flame
That doesnt quite its not the same
 It does
 Yasha want to go first
 Im going to jeez youre really hurt
arent you Beau
 It just seems like a waste I feel like I
should take out at least the other guy to lessen
to the damage coming in
 What is the wisdom thing that you did
 The hydra or the
 Im going to Sacred Flame the other guy
 Okay Oh no that was a dex save It
doesnt matter
 I dont know what the fuck to do Im
trying to get this guy out Okay
 I guess Thats all I can fucking do
 Tight
 Shoot up kill the monster guy
 Because he can kill Beau he can do double
damage right now to her if he hits her
 Do it Kill the guy
 Yes he is Hes right next to Beau
He can kill her Kill her kill her
  Kill him
 A lot
 Yeah go take it
 Plus five
 Up the butt
 I know hes going to get a hit on us Im
going to go down if I heal Beau so Im going to
heal Beau and hope that somebody takes care of him
before he kills us Im going to use my duplicate
to reach down and touch Beau Can I see my
duplicate
 Well Im already within range of him
 Can I see
 Okay Im going to reach down and use Cure
Wounds at level one because thats what Ive got
 With touch yes
 Ten points of healing
 Thats all Ive got
 I dont have anything to do for bonus
outside of Spiritual Weapon
 Okay okay Ive got something Can I bring
my duplicate up next to me For my bonus action
 It is he gets a negative he gets
disadvantage on attack rolls against me when my
duplicates next to me
 Thats a lie I get on advantage on
attacks they dont have disadvantage on me
 Holy shit
 Was it
 I mean Beau would have definitely died
 

 Did we get a long rest after
 Can I pull out Sprinkle

squish his little cheeks

 Let me see
 Only because I would totally do it if they
were both looking and I rolled like shit I think
theres a ship
 Oh man I dont know Id be okay with it
I guess
 Well it doesnt have to be a scrap like
Avantika said It could be you know go in and
take stuff but maybe we could also give them
something
 I dont know like new names or pretty
drawings
 Yeah we could just make it a fun time for
them
 She made me question what we just did I
thought it was one thing and then her face made me
think its a whole other thing
 I mean whatever Fjord I guess we can do
that if you want to I dont care
 Im already down Im not there anymore
 Oh no
 I come running in Do I need to fix a
hole
 I use the cantrip Mending
 Probably not
 One little thing goes 
 Oh my gosh

 Hey Fjord You know sometimes you can be
nice to people too And make them think that they
are friends
 Im waving at them Hi
 While hes doing that Im going to say
 I
need a volunteer
 In the other ship
 I just want to let it known that Im asking
for a volunteer from the other crew
 I need a volunteer
 It can be anyone but there should be at
least one
 For a special present Its a treat
 
 Liam

 What are you hiding I chase after Nott
 Im following Nott
 Whatd you find

hiding I want to know
 Oh hi Notts hiding something
  Lets all walk around walk
around the whole room
 Oh thats you Thats you Nott Okay
hi
  Should I draw with it Should I do
something with it
 What is it
 Yeah It was amazing
 What is it Caleb
 What do you want a tattoo of
 Yeah no what do you want a tattoo of
like a picture of
 What is it
 What
 I think Molly would like that
 I mean I dont know maybe it was really
sacred to him and he would be really super
offended by it
 But its fine Im sure
 What is it
 Okay okay
 It can do a thousand square feet of
surface I mean I learn from you in a moment
 
  Oh my god
 This is my favorite thing in the entire
universe
 This is the most amazing thing in the
entire universe
 I wont lose it I wont Caleb
 I promise I will not draw a penis on your
head
 Inanimate
 But it can get us an escape from somewhere
it can
 Oh my god this is the most amazing thing
in the entire universe
 Im okay I can live with that
 It comes with enough to cover a thousand
square feet of surface
 So if I made a ship then it would use a lot
of it
 But I mean lots of things that are little
oh my god
 Just think about how many dicks that is If
its like a fiveinch dick thats like  dicks
 No you cant do that
 If you want theyre nonmagical items
 I have a shield
 Maybe because its upclose and personal
with Fjord or it could be good for us
 Its pretty cool
  No
 Just some paint
 I mean should I try it just to see
 Im going to paint on the floor the
teeniest of dicks Like this big
 An erect penis
 Wait I have a question then If I make a
tree if I draw a tree would the tree be made of
stone or would it be made out of would it look
like a tree
 I pick up the little stone penis Who wants
it
 Does the serpent get released if the little
orbs are spread out amongst other people or do
they all have to be in one person
 But doesnt she have two spheres
 What if she does get the last one
 Maybe Fjord you can like go seduce her
or something Then you know with the seduction
then  you can sneak into her office
 It just seems like shes into you you
know
 Yeah I think youre fucked
 If you dont fuck youre going to get
fucked
 I lived
 Yeah
 Does it make you uncomfortable Do you want
someone else to seduce her
 I will follow

 Youre welcome
 Oh no Ooh 
 Yeah no
 All right Hey I made a friend
 The Little Sapphire Thats my pirate
name
 Do we recognize her
 Who was that
 Oh yeah Coasters are not heavy enough
 Do divers die there
 Would I have heard ghost stories
 
 I mean I read a poem about her
 Her hungry eye
 Doesnt she have a ring or something that
you said in the song
 No I know it I just didnt I mean I
read it like one time a long time ago
 Yeah
 No why would you ever get a bad feeling
about that
 Her hungry eye
 Oh Dashilla
 Well we didnt fight them under the water
 Shes an underwater banshee For sure
 Mmhmm Yeah
 It sounds a lot like glubby glubs

 Sure
 Oh you totally could have gotten the stuff
from that guy
 Definitely wouldnt
 Bye
 Did any of us see that
 
 
 
 Mm
 I dont understand what
 Yeah Well of course I do I always have a
lot of stuff on me here you go
 I thought it was Allison
 Thats so pretty
 Weve reached a new level
 Im staring at this milk that I ordered and
its really disgusting And I
 No it has lumps in it
 Yeah
 What I seem off
 Oh I just well
 I dont like her very much
 No
 Oh but were all kind of murderers
sometimes arent we
 No
 I mean we have killed some people
 No I dont I havent ever done that Ive
done some pretty shady stuff though
 Have you done some shady stuff
 Have you done stuff thats piratey before
you were a pirate
 Whats the shadiest thing you ever did
 Thats okay though
 But it is a really cool trick They got to
see magic
 Thats true It all balances out Youve
done really good things too
 Do you want some of this lumpy milk
 No
 I know Shes so nice And now were
pirates and Im never going to see her again
 Its really possible Caleb What if we can
never go home
 Nott definitely doesnt want to be in the
sea
 I think Caduceus doesnt like the water
either basically because it tried to kill him a
few times already
 I dont even know if he likes it a lot
 Like Avantika
 I dont know
 It feels funny
 Well You know when you really like
somebody but then you start to know them and you
go Do I like them or do I like what I thought
they were and then you dont know
 And then you think that they are flirting
with you but then you found out that probably
werent you know
 So you feel kind of sad about it and maybe
a little stupid
 You had a girlfriend before though yeah
 You said her name when we were
dancing and then I put you to sleep and you said
her name again
 Was she pretty
 Was she a boy
 Oh Okay
 Im trying to get an image of her in my
brain here
 Did she have like a really good nose or
something
 Really
 Youre mysterious Caleb you know that
 And now shes saying we all have to take
the same boat How are we going to get away from her
 Just literally right there at the table
 Are you okay
 Tomorrow we find some books
 Yeah thats important to him
 Yeah Thanks Caleb
  I thought about it It would have
been pretty funny for you to wake up but I like
you more than that Are we sleeping on our boat
Where should I go
 I guess just sitting in here for a while
 All of us together
 I hit his hand High five
 Well if we dont come back cant you take
the Mistake and go home
 Two weeks if were not back in two
weeks
 Mermaids are part pretty people and part
fish people
 Well Yeah
 Lets go
 Can I have taken Im assuming a short
rest and heal up from my fight while we were all
chilling here
  Whoa
 It smells like poop out here
 Keep your hands on your coin purses
 Tiffany
 Thats the name
 Tiffanys Ship
 Your heart The Apricot is your heart
 Tiffany can be invisible though you guys
 Im going to keep an eye out to see if the
mist ever parts around us
 Dont you think its weird that someone
would be a pirate and they would come here because
they were a pirate and then they change their mind
and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead
 You shouldnt use her real name
 I like him
 I just remembered
 Well I have this new spell that the
Traveler was telling me about It lets you pop in
somewhere You can just pop in and then you can
bring somebody with you Its like a doorway
 I would pop into her office
 Thats a really good question Let me think
about it Hey Traveler how far away can I use
this spell  whole feet he says
 I dont know how we would get out of it
once I was in there though because I can only use
it once but I suppose
 Yeah but wouldnt somebody be keeping
watch on the ship though
 And do what
 Should we be using your name or should we
call you something else right now too
 Will we be using the fancy doorway
 Well yes but that is
 Thats the thing she would definitely see
there was a new door
 I cant go twice I can just do it once
 Tiffany
 Honda keeps Tiffany busy
 I should bring somebody with me
 Okay me and you Beau
 You dont want yourself connected with this
at all
 Plus heres the thing Caduceus is really
perceptive
 Thats true
 Thats true you could be Sorris
 Ipess Thats right
 We never get into trouble together I mean
this is foolproof
 Any time weve tried to do anything
together it went off seamlessly
 We could stay on the boat That would solve
all of our problems
 I mean weve been staying on it already
dont we have quarters on there
 We all wait until Fjord starts boning and
then we start our action
 This is way more complicated than I thought
it was going to be
 Avantika knows I mean Tiffany knows that
that owl is yours Caleb its not like its a
secret if shes seen the owl before shes going
to know youre spying on her
 His boning makes thunder
 His weenie
 We head towards the ship
 We walk towards the ship
 Shouldnt you be able to Message Nott and
say shes on the move if
 So maybe stay close where you can see it if
she leaves
 Yeah we can just go to our quarters or
something
 Yeah What do you think
 Because its our ship
 Is it within  feet of
 Fuck yeah Yeah lets go to our quarters
in the Bloated Cup
 Start it in the tavern
 Could always use advantage
 We could potentially jump out the window
too
 What are you talking about
 Im so dextrous
 Were up in our rooms
 Nott just look at the dodecahedron
 Okay
 Yeah She stole mail one time
 That and her beautiful hair 
 I wasnt Beau I love your hair I wasnt
laughing at you
 I wasnt laughing at you I love your hair
okay
  Left Second room on the
left
 Oh I see
 Okay I dont need to be able to see it I
know exactly the spot I desire I can visualize it
because weve been in her office before
 I dont know Ive never done it before
 Never
 Doorways are the tits
 I cast Pass Without a Trace on both of us
 We are amazing We need to start looking
because we only have a few minutes
 Okay start looking Can we both see
because we both have darkvision
 We should probably figure out a way to
light up the room Are there curtains
 No we should close them
 I sneak over and close the windows
quietly
 Oh you already have advantage Blessing of
the Trickster There you go I gave you blessing
so you get advantage
  Natural 
 Plus ten because Pass Without a Trace
  No wait 
 Does she have a candle in the room that we
could light
 Take your cloak off and shove it under the
door to block the light
 I take my cloak off and I put it next to
the doorway to block the light
 I light the candle
 We start searching through her office
 Were looking for anything shes written
about where the last fruit tree is the last temple
 Im going through papers
 Im looking through her desk seeing if I
can find any false bottoms or anything like that
to try to find secret information
 Each make an investigation
 Oh we get advantage No
 Shit
 Nine Which is like a natural  in this
campaign
 Okay
 This is better than three
 Oh no Hit the deck
 We hold our breath I take out the paint
and I paint a hole in the bottom of the floor In
 I try to pull it open
 
 I was just looking but you can take
okay
 Sure
 
 Is there a rug in the room
 Then I pull the rug over the hole that I
just made after we go under
 Oh shit I do the same thing I see her do
it and I grab my thing and blow out the candle and go
 Two
 As I go down the hole I pull the rug over
the hole
 I have no idea where this takes us
  Take one of the things you
stole and put it next to them
 Oh no Thats okay
  Shit
 What if the poison is still up there
 I will lift Nott up to peek her head
through
 No
 What Okay I bring
 I crouch down so Nott can
  What Whats going on Nott
Shit
 Can I cast Lesser Restoration on Nott
Nott Snap out of it Nott
 I dont know I didnt even look
 Condition no
 One condition affecting and the condition
can be blinded deafened paralyzed or poisoned
 Okay thats good
 Oh my god
 What do we do
 I heard them yelling How do we get off of
here
 What should we do We left a hole in the
floor
 Nott tell her nothing crazy you know You
dont want it to connect to us or anything
 I dont know Maybe we can just get out
 Oh right Okay
 What are we going to disguise ourselves
as
 Are we still going to do that
 No it doesnt make any more sense though
 What if I make another hole in the floor
and we keep going down until we can get out
 Can I
 Can I stand up on the bed and try to make
the hole look like it wasnt perfectly painted
like it was like broken wood
 Can I do that though
 I wonder if I can use one of my pieces of
paper to like put on there and then make it wood
like fix it
 Thats what I thought was going to happen
but I wanted to see
 Good show
 Okay Im going to do what I originally
planned which is to make the hole not look like a
perfect hole To make it look like the planks
broke or something
 Oh wait no should I do that
 Leave the fucking hole the way it is Well
leave a couple gems in the bed
 Two gems in the bed
 Oh come on
 No
 Perfect Now we disguise ourselves yes
 Well wrap our arms around each other and
then disguise ourselves
 No
 Oh okay Im going to be Molly
 In pirate clothes
 Yeah
 With a cloak over his head
 I did it I already said it Still Pass
Without A Trace Still trying to sneak out
   lies
 No
 Run We run
 Are we being stealthy
 Were stealthing
 Quickly
 Still Pass Without a Trace
 
 The seaward side
 Put that book in the bag so it doesnt get
wet
 I dont know
 We jump in
 Lets try to go in quietly
 This is going perfectly
 Oh my god that was almost a one But its
not Its a 
 
 Dont let go Nott
 Natural 
 But Disguise Self to where we look dry
 Do you think I seem noticeable
 Yeah but were Disguise Self so we look
dry
 Yeah I feel like you may be less
noticeable than a purple me
 Okay
 Yeah
 Is anybody in the shit alley
 We should probably drop our forms
 Yeah In the shit alley
  Oh my god
 No Nott I have Mending
 Its a cantrip and I can mend things that
have holes in them
 Not a hole that big It wouldnt have
worked on a hole that big
 Everything we did was perfect
 I mean it went according to plan
 Shh hide that Thats in my bag anyway
 Oh We need to hide those too
 What the fuck are we going to do If she
searches our shit shes going to know that we stole
 We got to figure this out like stat
 All right
 You did too youre pretty cool
 Okay Were going to go into our rooms
 Hi
 Youre going down there Dont go down
there Caduceus
 No theres guards everywhere
 Schmidle of a one
 What do you mean
 Theyll know
 Oh
 Should we look around the room and make
sure nobody can spy on us Look for peepholes in
the room
 That keeps sound in
 We got a book Nott found it
 Yeah
 When we were looking for letters and words
and stuff we ended up breaking her desk and we
stole a bunch of jewels
 Well and then the room filled with poison
and then we put a hole in the floor and we fell
 Then we jumped in the water and we got
away
 The thing is though Avantikas going to
definitely know that somebody stole her stuff
 I like Jamedi I thought he was nice
 Well yeah but
 If we hold on and Avantikas like Lets
everybody empty their pockets and we have them
 I think shes in love with Avantika too
 Because she pulled me aside and she was
like I dont like Fjord and Ill kill him if you
want me to
 Eight
 Okay so maybe she didnt say that But I
still dont think she likes Fjord very much
 The jade necklace
 A given
 To what
 Cracked the case Fjord are you as crazy
as she is Because holy shit
 Not your saving throw
 You have maxed out intelligence
 Thats a necklace
 It doesnt say the name
 Itll come right out
 Apricots Fjord
 If I know we shouldnt have grabbed
everything
 We could just throw them in the ocean
 Yeah I like it
 Calebs brain
 Were part of the crew
 Big lead safe not in the bag
 But the little box that we have the thing
in yeah
 Oh no its getting late Im getting
confused
 Too late

like it could be hollow or anything
 Im looking for somewhere that I can put a
hole in it hide the jewels in there and then
Mend it so that it wont look like anything ever
touched it But Ill know where they are
 Do I get advantage still if this was last
night
 Okay 
 Yeah but if I get searched
 Yeah
 Yeah and you dont think shes going to
go Open this safe
 If she turns the bag over and empties it

 Bouldergut what is going on right now
 Me too Everybody seems so angry at
everybody else Look at the ship right now It
looks crazy all these people walking around
 Me too While Im talking to her and
hopefully when I point at the ship Does she look
where I point
 
 I reach in the bag and I pull out the
jewels and I dump them off the side I want them
to fall in the water as were walking
  I wish I had looked at the
Dodecahedron this morning  
 Bouldergut was in the back though
 Oh my god
 Yeah And like a principal that always
knows when youre lying

in the crowd but near everyone

 Then if Im within  feet Im going to
cast Prayer of Healing on my buds
 On my buddies
 A deception check Okay
 Eight Well I hope those people are going to be
okay They look like theyre pretty hurt up in
there Some of them look like theyre bloody That

then I aint going to do it
 Is it Jamedi
 I like Jamedi
 From the crowd Im going to go
 Shes
lying We always knew she had it in for the Plank King
 Before everybody gets on the boat can I
run over to the docks because Im not shackled
and I try to find the jewels that I dumped off the
docks
 Okay
 Ooh 
 Two ones
 No
 These are beautiful rocks Beautiful
 What Theyre going to hate us
 Thats what I was going to try to do yeah
Anything thats small enough Im going to try to
mend Small holes
 Yeah
  I was thinking about it but
its a lot of the use of the paint because
 Thats what I want I dont want to paint
the whole thing
 How big are the holes Are they giant
 Okay
 No Im not talking Mending Im talking
how big are the holes
 Should we get close to a port or
something
 Shouldnt we get to a port or something
before we
 Might have canvas at least
 You can do that
 Im going to
  Hey look at me Im
Avantika
 Yeah her little altar
 Above deck can I go find Fjord
 So that happened 
 How do you feel about it
 Yeah
 Did he cause that explosion
 Wow
 He did a lot of damage
 So now were going to find the place where
your ship wrecked yeah
 You didnt get to ask them about Vandren
though
 Wow Do you think if we find him youll
stop talking like him
 You know I could probably send a message
to the Plank King and ask him about Vandren if
you want me to
 Well I can send him a message the same way
I try to talk to my mama and the Gentleman and
Kiri sometimes
 Yeah
 Oh just that shes really cute and that I
miss her and I wish I could see her and I hope
shes enjoying herself and that I am sorry that
we havent seen each other in a while and that we
are pirates and
 She usually responds with Were pirates
and I miss you and
 No she doesnt say that She says Yes
Im very cute a lot
 Whatever you want me to
 Of course Your teeth are coming in
 I saw it peek out of your lip just now
 Of course Fjord
 Yeah Im going to go see if everythings
mended over this way
 Can we cast Control Water to get us there
faster at all
 Of course I do
 Maybe I can do that every day
 Thatd be a Locate Object sort of
situation
 A ship
 Im going to do it
 Yeah Im going to look for his
 Three each
 Yeah it might be smart to have a boat that
actually works before we go down
 Yeah but we ripped out the page saying
where to find
 But you can breathe it so its really
not
 Yeah
 So were going to hang around this area
before we get to the boat wrecks yeah
 Okay
 
 God Nine
 Oh shit I was too
 Even lower
 
 Thats true  on the first roll
 Lame on the second roll
 Should we try one more
 Motherfuck
 Six
 Ooh Should I use another rdlevel spell
and try to find the orby thing
 I dont have Bless
 Bless us
 Oh and I want to learn the cantrip
Guidance but I dont know any good healers that
can teach it to me
 
 Motherfuck Im going to use a third
 
 I was on the orb
 I was concentrating on the ball
 I give him a wet willie
 No it wasnt a thousand
 Will the breathing underwater will that
make it to where our ears wont hurt really bad
Because I hear when you go down underwater your
ears hurt really bad
 No wait We have to get a good nights
sleep We just used all of our spells finding this shit
 Theres no nothing
  Dashilla the Dreadful
  And a hungry eye
 Did you give us anything for that Did we
get bonuses or did we just get to hear you sing
 It was literally just Beau singing
 Probably not
 Its going to be dark down there
 I dont
 Im going to take Sprinkle out of my
hood
 Youre like a super ferret Youre like the
strongest little animal Ive ever seen I mean really
 Orly
 Do you like weasels
 I have a weasel and I dont want to take
him underwater
 Orly
 Hes like Guy Threepwood now
 Youll take good care of him
 If you dont I will know and I will give
you a tattoo If you do take good care of him
though I will give you a better tattoo
 I mean if you want
 He likes to eat fruit He likes to eat
cheese He likes to eat bugs
 He likes it if you talk to him
 Yeah we got bugs and cheese
 On the count of three when youre ready
 Were going to hold on to the sides
 Sure Fjord
 Oh god
 Can we talk down here
 We can
 Its like another world
 I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us
 
 Yeah
 So were searching for the orb
 Is there anything else we should look for
Fjord
 Do you have a pair of jammies or something
that you lost in the boat that you want us to look
for Your bedroom or something in there No
 Okay
 We still have Pass Without a Trace up I
just cast it because of that whale
 Ooh starting out right Woo
 We did have lights up
 When we step does it make a powder go up
because its like  on the ocean floor
 This is all fish poop  See that
Nott
 Should we go
 Its salt water too
 Youre going to get the poops if you do
it
 Is this where Dashilla is Or is she at a
different place
 Oh so there could be something really
scary in here
 The chances are really good Fjord Theyre
really good
 
 He made it off safely
 Oh I have the node
 I can node but somebody else could node
 Will water get in the bag if I look in
 Is it okay to do that
 Of course
 I guess Ill let this okay I let it go
too and float very ungracefully behind him
 Okay
 Do you think its locked
 He wouldnt have trapped it or anything
 I dont have any I mean I can try to
look for traps or something but
 
 
 Now I know why you asked me to come with
you
 Thorough investigation
 I mean okay
 Does it look like somebody stole things
from here
 Do you know if he kept anything in a secret
place
 Because maybe he took it all with him
Maybe he left
 Beau is really good at finding things I
think
 Ill keep looking around the room while
he
 
 Oh no It got taken Fjords going to be so
upset Can I cast Locate Object and see if I can
sense the orb around within a thousand feet
 Oh my god that would be so amazing
 Right
 
 Fjord
 Fjord
 It got taken The orb is gone
 Yeah but its over there
 My spidey sense is tingling Its behind
us Its over there I used Locate Object
 You want to go now You dont want to look
around or any
 Locate Object lasts ten minutes If it
takes longer to get there then
 Well come back
 Whos coming with Fjord
 I think all of us should go
 Within a thousand feet
 No
 You have two minutes
 While theyre looking I want to point out
to everyone that whatever it was that took this
ball has claws and it looks like it could break
this thing open It looks like it might do some
damage to us
 Its bad
 Mmhmm
 Be on guard
 Are the globules of light around
 Thats why I said switch to a fucking dice
that I gave you
 Fuck Now were underwater with them
 Shit shit shit
 Shit shit shit balls shit
 Wow this is so cool Matthew
 Look at that coolass bustedup ship
 I would have been close behind because
 Are you How are you drunk
 Oh no These trident things are really bad
Do you remember how bad they are
 Yeah
 
 Sure Ill use Guiding Bolt
 The one that Yashas attacking
 Yasha
 
 d Thats cocked
    points
 Yes
 Yeah Im going to back up
 Yeah Yeah thats good
 To be not within five feet of Caleb I want
to be against the wall of whatever that
yeah like that
 But magic attacks are fine
 Yeah thats what I was going to say
 Dont attack the same thing you guys
 Punching damage
 Yeah I know I was about to say
 But youre going to get harpooned in
Youll be grappled
 No
 Can we grab onto him for a reaction
 Oh no
 Whats its weakness Beau
 Is it hexed did you hex it
 Oh this is Yasha
 That was still really cool
 Youve got Bane
 Wait before you do it Im going to Guiding
Bolt him so you get advantage
 Im going to step out and Guiding Bolt him
that was my plan
 That definitely hits Thats  plus
seven
 
 Then you get advantage
 From behind Beau off in the distance I
at the same time
 Negative d
 Oh no its moving away Sentinel
 Yasha is such a badass
 Thats what I said
 What Why
 Yeah were trying not to let it get away
 Nobody will be able to get up there
 I guess if it just took its turn then
there will be Yasha
 Plus
  Fish dicks
 You killed it
 Can we search the bodies
 Can I hold up one of the fish claws and see
if it matches the claws that are on the box
 You guys its not the same fish claws
Its something bigger that had the box
 It only lasts for ten minutes so I mean
we might be coming to the very end of it
 Its over that way Its still  to 
feet
 Me
 Sure
 You cant hear anything
 Okay yeah 
  Its a graveyard
 Lets continue
 Can we move stealthily underwater
 Itll be a slow journey but we can try to
move
 Oh no were so evil But the average
 Ooh I feel better
 Is it moving or is it a blip or a what
 Theres like a light Yeah
 I mean its in front of us yeah About
how far away is it
 Is it around where the orb feels like it
is
 I wont get any use out of it
  minutes we want to sit here in the
open in the graveyard for an hour
 Just think about how much damage you did
when you were barely even trying
 You can stick with me
 What
 Oh this is like when we first started and
we were in a line You guys remember and we were
looking for that witch
 Sure
 Then Beau Jester and Fjord in the
middleish
 Yeah
 I should be on the other side of Fjord so
Im closer to Caleb
 Thats definitely a glimmer pot
 Are we going to just walk straight towards
it then or maybe
 Oh Dont look at the light
 Good call
 Caleb send Frumpkin up and see what the
lantern light is
 Bones
 Keep moving forward slowly Nott Ill hold
Calebs hand on the other side
 Whatever
 Were spread out
 What did you see
 What was the glimmer
 He didnt see a lot did he
 Lets all just run forward and charge over
the ridge
 Is it going to work
 Lets keep on going
 Can we cut some of the seaweed and hold it
in front of us so that when we move it just looks
like seaweed
 No all of us are doing it Whoever wants
to be stealthy and be a brilliant person I guess
 I mean I can try
 Okay
 Can we see what made the light
 Dont do that
 Shes drunk dont tell her to do stupid
things
 Can we swim around and look for another
entrance to this cavern
 I mean I can only get it  feet away from
me

 Then I can send Jester down there
 Okay
 Should I try to send my duplicate down
 Okay Im going to create my duplicate

have her skip around and see the coins and be
like and go over and act like shes going to try
to get the coins
 Shit It might need actual vibrations or
 Nott dont Im going to hold onto Nott as
we jump down
 Yeah Theres more treasure inside if you
make it past the initial treasure
 Were heading down
the ocean floor
 Im going to send the duplicate out in
front of us Ive still got  seconds left of it

 I let go of Nott as soon as were into the
tunnel away from the coins
 It only lasts for a minute but yes I can
keep her there as long as she lasts
 Shes gone
 Which way are we going

the cluster Can we use a stick or something You

 Do we know of any museums or places with
magical items in Port Damali
 Natural 
 I dont know how to spell exalted
 Thats his catoctopus Owl also owl
 Maybe its like a piggy bank or something
Maybe it holds a certain amount of coins and you
have to turn it the right way Can you hear coins
 Maybe theyre really jammed in there good

shake around
 How much money do you have down in the box
Because thats a lot of times
 Oh its half every time
 Oh Nott already took them
first time
 She can stay with us forever
 Yeah Kiris wonderful

paint to paint her a really cool pirate hat that

tricorn And do you want feathers and stuff

bow Sometimes bows are really pretty
little squirrel
 Totally It will be a squirrel figurine on
this next to the feather Itll be really pretty
okay There we go 
 You look like a really good pirate
  What if the hole disappears while
Nott is still in it
 I feel like we should put our head through
it
 But do it really fast
 You have to do it
 Ill get ready with Cure Wounds
 Take them
 Oh my god what if its a safe in another
dimension
 Do we recognize it
 Thats definitely an H with a bow
 Was there anything else in there

storing stuff in it
  Its a vault
 I follow him and sit next to him
 Oh cool

too long were going to pull you up
 That was it
 Yeah do it

 Does it smell like death in here
 Right Definitely wont lead to anything
  DD
 That was not a sick beat
 Theyre not right next to each other I
pictured a lovers embrace
 Is this still the same day It is Okay

 I have an idea What if we put on the red
cape and then it does something if the statue
behind the red thing sees it
 Put it on or something
 Caleb are you okay
 Who wants to put on the red robe
 The dead guys
 Im going to make sure Im not in line with
any of the banners
 Im going to step wide Ugh I cant reach

 Oh god
 You should put on the robe Did you put on
the robe I can help you put on the robe
 The wailing creature could
 Yeah but he is in line with the wailing
creature
 Ooh the center
 Can we all fit inside of it
 I want to stay still as much away from a
lineup as we like in front of the things
 Im going to soften it up with my mouth
 Im going to crouch even in the thing
 Do the red Maybe its fire
and I stick my hand out and it flies out the
spectral hand I pull back into the safety and it
pushes aside the red
 Hmm Ooh Fjord look in your pockets
 Of the red robe Look in the pockets of the
red robe
purse a little set of tools on a ring and I give
it to the hand and whisper it off again to go see
if it can pick the lock
 Whoa
 Natural one
 We should see what it is though
 Should we just go out then
 She makes a duplicate of herself
 And she likes chocolate
 I mean I dont know
 Maybe they brought her on purpose and they
dont want us anymore
 Its possible
 Well
 Okay okay

 He always sends Frumpkin in to die
 Does Frumpkin hear anyone
 All of us
 Dont worry about us
 We should follow her
 I walk behind Fjord and I cast Blessing of
the Trickster when I touch your back
 Does the floor seem rounded too
 Ill go after Nott
 Hey Caleb You know in haunted houses a lot
of time they attack the person in the back
 No thats a really creepy song from
thats from Insidious
 Whoa thats freaky
 By gravity
 Can we see any movement outside the
flames
 Oh well  no
 Should we do it stealthily
 Im going to case Pass Without a Trace on
all of us
 
 That was a neat trick
 They make badass notebooks
 Whoa Theres a ladder you guys
 Ooh A door that works
 Wheres the fireplace Is it straight
across
 Those books look like you could remove them
and play with them
 That wasnt cocked
 We should have checked for traps and stuff
you guys
 Does he have a ring on
 Okay thats where I was going What about
a green ring though Does he have a green ring
 Wait describe him Say him again
 And hes got lots of rings on
 Oh look I bet its that guy Thats his
robe
 Hes thin
 What just happened Where did Fjord just
go
 Im going to run up where Fjord
disappeared
 That looks like an open book at the end of
the room Caleb
 I immediately turn around and Invoke
Duplicity down on the ground near them
 Right next to them
 Mmhmm
 Five but I rolled a natural one
 Voodoo doll
 Okay Im going to turn around with my
duplicate and Im going to cast Inflict Wounds on
the cabinet
 Can you do that
 Okay Im going to do that at ndlevel
 Yeah thats d
 
  points
 Yes

 Yeah Im paying attention to her and going

 You actually I dont think have Pass
without Trace because I Invoked Duplicity but whatever
 That was pretty gross straight through
 Did anybody see what he was doing when he
disappeared
 I turn around and watch it happen
back
 Its just a book
 On the one on the table
 It didnt come with us
 What do you see Beau
 Okay
 Ill get down so that you can get up and
cast it
 To come up on the level where Beau is
 Oh no
 Natural 
 Okay The minute he rears up Im going to
Invoke Duplicity again
 Six
 Yeah
 Maybe you can punch him with the gem
 Is the dragon still on the ground or is
it
 Okay Im going to cast Spirit Guardians on
myself
 Yeah
 So it saves
 Okay so do I roll damage right now
 Okay okay okay No I think its at the
top of its turn isnt it that you said
 Okay
 Okay Then Im going to back up
 The opposite direction that Fjord went
Yeah to about there I cant do anything for a
bonus action right now can I I cant dodge or
something as a bonus action
 Yeah that makes sense Okay then Im
 Oh wait Oh I backed up Thats okay
 Get the fuck out That would kill us
instantly if it hits us At least it would almost
kill me instantly
 Is it a negative d
 I know right
 Im going to go
 Okay Traveler please let this work Im
going to cast Polymorph on the dragon
 Wisdom saving throw of 
 Im going to Polymorph him into oh god
Im going to Polymorph him into a crimson weasel
Catch him Because somebody has to catch him
 Oh no Im really stupid though
 A six
 Beau do you have a reaction
 Yeah would it be like missile snare Right
underneath it
 Oh its got too much
it might end
 Yeah I didnt hear
 Oh wait I want to back up
 No Ill stay there Am I within  feet of
him if hes on the ground
 Yeah What a giant waste
 Oh I rolled a natural  I wasnt even
looking at it
 And I cast Hellish Rebuke as soon as it
hits me If Im alive
 I use Hellish Rebuke and I go
 That hurt
In Infernal Oh god
 Yes
  I turn
 That was cold damage
 Oh well thats good You get an attack
and the fire gets an attack
 No Im sorry I just made a weasel and not
a fucking cow or something
 Even casting the spell in its vicinity Try
casting it
 Its my turn
 Okay well
 Taking a cue from Fjord Im going to cast
Blink on myself
 Then if I try to run underneath the
dragon
  hes going to get an attack of
opportunity on me
 No Okay then Im just going to dash
underneath it
 No by dash I mean run Sorry
 No I rolled a three
 Okay then for my bonus action I get a
bonus action

 Hes bloodied Hes definitely bloodied
 Okay A single scale is chipped away
 Misses It misses
 Cool
 No you have to roll for it
 Four
 Okay
 I guess Im going to this is so lame
Its so stupid because Cure Wounds isnt going to
do enough to fix me to where if he hits me Im
still going to go down
 That is at the highest level
 I know
 Fuck it Im going to cast Inflict Wounds

 Mine is also a save against dex of 
 Guiding Bolt at the one coming closest
 
 Okay  points of radiant damage

some googly eyes above it

dangerous guy youve ever heard of and theres
crossed paths with the crew of Captain Tusktooth

more  I can do that
 Yeah I remember how I did it too
 I think thats a good plan Captain
 Yeah did you release it or what
 Where
 Wait a coast with three cities Thats the
Menagerie Coast
 Thats his mentor
 I could still send a message to the Plank
King and see if he answers
 Did he talk to you
 Do you think he can read your thoughts
 I mean if what hes telling you to do is
go towards the coast that is what youre doing
so maybe he still thinks youre on his side
 Do you think the Wildmother can hear your
thoughts
 So if you think something dirty she knows
What if youre thinking Oh man I really got to poop
 What if youre thinking Aww man I think
I smell a little bit today Ive got a booger in
my nose
 What if you think Oh does my breath

four that I rolled originally  plus one is 
plus proficiency is three so 
 Plus I think Im proficient with forgery
kit Oh I understand
 Whose name should the ship be under
 Should it be Tusktooth or should it be
somebody thats not a piratey name
 Yeah a new sort of name Do they know any
of your names in Nicodranas I mean it could be anybody
 Caleb you could look pretty officious
 We would be giving the ship to Orly

 Skiffback Right

 Whats going on Are you sleepy
Are you getting sleepy Caleb
 
 Nott
 Do you want help looking
 Of course
 Im going to help Nott search
through the rubble
 Okay
 I try to slam into the door to open it
 Ten
 Im sorry Nott Yasha
 Maybe I can cast Dispel Magic
Is it magic Is it trapped
 Im going to cast Dispel Magic
 Or maybe they came in through
 I go up and can I touch and see if
theres an invisible person in the chair
 Im going to sit in the chair and see what
I see What does it look like from the chair
 Like maybe this old dodecahedron
down here
 Not here
 Wait rumors we squashed by
spreading a batch of molded fruit crop
 Kryn thats what they actually are
  Blah blah blah extremely
difficult to work with Attempts to isolate
a substance capable containing and sustaining
the dunamantic energies within a casing has
proven both timeconsuming and costly You
have some of the same stuff Wait look
 I dont know In these past weeks
we have successfully distilled a single vial
that should enable a temporary influx of
dunamis to even an untrained soldier
Once I can remove the beacon itself from the
process I hope to have this alchemist produce
a number of batches over the next  to 
months refining the method with each step
until we can certify its use in combat
Is that your friend the alchemist
 Listen listen Word has found me of Trent
finding a few of his proteges have a knack
for early dunamancy blah blah something
something I am eager to look over their findings
and perchance fold these skills into my own
Imagine something something could be
accomplished by the Assembly should we further
learn to command these Theres so many
things I cant read because its burned away
existence The dreams are already thrilling
 You dont Theyre going to be so pissed
when they find out we have that thing
 Oh no thats going to be
way harder to cover up
 We can put the foldable tripod
 We have a Bag of Holding
 Oh thats right
 Why should we break the chair
 We need to get out of here
 Lets go Quickly
 No I just saw the room
 Was there anything under the chair
On the underside of the chair
 Go go Do we need to clean up Calebs puke
Will somebody be able to find us with his puke
 Not here no Its staying
in the bag dont worry
 You need somewhere
 We can send a message anytime
 Yeah my mama
 You sneaky motherfucker
 I cant wait to interrogate you
 Deep blue robes
 Lead the way
 Is it the opposite direction of the
hmmhmm
 Take the cart too huh
 Lets go
 So hey what the fuck
 I will stay and help you
 What are you so nervous about
 I mean youre just here to check on
your son Thats a good cover I guess
Was it your son or are you even a goblin
 I mean if its your son
thats really sad Nott
 Are you okay
 Im pretty open too
 Is that your son for real
 And thats you This is how you looked
 But youre so pretty
 That was here
 Spin the Bottle
 So was he right Did you die
 How long has it been
 I feel like we can get this fixed
 We can do something
 Is it the people you know
 Try to undrunk Nott
 Do you want some candy
 I mean it does seem like they were
using him
 How do you know them
 Are there woods
 They could go stay with my mama They could
stay at the Lavish Chateau for the time being
 Bryce is there
 I could send a message see if Bryce
would be okay with that What do you think
 Im going to not be able to do this
in  words Its so hard
 This is going to Bryce Okay
 Oh thats good Dont talk in full
sentences Why didnt I think of that
 Do I say stop
 I could just vocally stop because
Bryce will hear me
 Hello
 Its Jester Two people incoming A
woman and child Take care of them please
Were sending money with them
 This is important
 I thought I had five more words
 Okay
 Please help
 Okay I think theyre going to help
 Okay Oh sorry about that
 Yes because I want to hear
what Caleb has to say
 Mm
 Are you in love with me
 Oh
 I dont either
 Teachers are cool too
 You just cared about your teacher
 Good for you
 Well I figured you cared since you 
were checking up on her
  I totally thought she was your
roommate You were really good about that
 Youre welcome
 Caleb We can tell youre really scared and
thats okay to be scared We just dont know why
 Did you die too
 How
 Yeza
 Would they know who you are
 Theyre high up then huh
 Holy shit
 Wait isnt that where you want to go
Fjord
 Its really bad or something
 Thats why you always make that face 
Im sorry Caleb
 Well I dont think our actions define who
we are all the time Good people do bad things
sometimes Even bad people do good things
I think youre a good person
 I dont think a very bad person would care
that he was very bad
 Are you secretly in love with me

 Like the skin
 That sounds like a bad person
 Would they see if we were disguised or would
they have to look for us Do you know what I mean
 Okay
 It says it
 It says His instincts are solid
 Yeza Im assuming While I find this
alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity
Im sorry I dont believe that
 The Academys eye for talent proves
itself again
 It says they want him to produce a number
of batches of that liquid the one that we stole
 They wouldnt kill him then They need him
to make batches over the next  to  months
 Well shes really hot
 I wonder if maybe we can break
him out before he gets there Maybe he
it only just happened
 Are we going to have to scout out and
listen in on peoples conversations see if we can
 Maybe if we go with our insurance company
scheme we can say that we believe theres been
fraud and hes not really dead or something
 Lady
 Do you think maybe theyre attacking
because we have the thingy
 Okay
 Be smart Be so smart
 It says theres other beacons
 Okay so theres more than one
 As we continue to invoke the beacon
That means they have one
 Right with extremely focused energy of
different spectrums and sources divine and
arcane the effects unleashed are ever curious and
reach far beyond this laboratory The dunamis
field often sightlessly encompassed an entire
portion of the town with locals complaining of an
ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged
down So
 Oh my god what if you put the dodecahedron
on the tripod thing that we got right Then we
hit it with some sort of spell I wonder if it
would amplify that spell you know what I mean
 Thats true
 Look at me
 Its only using us if you dont like us Do
you like us though
 Ja
 Fjord theyre way too powerful for us
 Fjord
 You can control water which I can do too
Im not that powerful
 Im just saying theyve probably been
studying for a very long time And if Im not wrong
theyre elves And elves live for a very
long time And they look kind of old okay
So theyre probably
 Youre pretty powerful okay Youre really
strong Youre very handsome You got some really
cool spells You can make darkness appear Its
really awesome
 Yes sir
 We were We were having a big fight
 Okay
 Easy peasy lemon squeezy Maybe we go up
into their room at night or something and just
you know Stabby stab
  Maybe I can send a message to him
 Hes such a wild mom hes partying
all the time
 Do you have to do it in the morning or can
you do it at night
 Oh I understand
 So we head to the inn
 Im going to take everything that weve
been looking at and stick in the bag so it cant
be scried on or something
 Yeah same
 Mmhmm
 Three rooms I think should do it
 Three
 That sounds like a very good deal Thank
you so much
 Yeah Ill pay for it
 We were hoping to buy some potions while we
were here Do you know if theres a good alchemy
shop or anything around
 Oh no
 Do you know The alchemy shop what was the
name of it
 Brenatto Apo Do you know if this Brenatto
is around still
 Okay
 Great
 Did we miss the meal already today then
 All right
 
 Oh really I was joking
 Honey
 Were keeping an eye out for any cloaked
robed elven people Yeah were trying to avoid them
 I also want to find a crownsguard
 You have a lovely full beard Matthew
  Ill split off from the group
so that Im not drawing attention Excuse me
 Yeah Im staying at the local inn right
now I have a friend Hes losing a little bit of
his hair and he was hoping I was hoping for a
present I could get him maybe a potion that would
grow it Do you know where I could find somebody
that could grow hair a potion maker or something
 I dont know what kind of potions can be
made Do you know
 Okay okay What about alchemy Is there a
local alchemist or something
 No
 Oh no The building is gone what about the
person that ran the shop
 Thats insane Ive never seen a crick
What do they look like
 Mmhmm
 How did they pop out of the ground
 Did you have to fight them
 You must be so brave
 I mean you look really brave
 Wow Well all right I guess Ill have to 
go to another town for a potion Can you point me
in the direction of this shop
 Yeah
 Okay Hey maybe the owner ran away
or something right
 Yeah Fingers crossed
 
 No I just wanted to see if they saw him
leaving the town Thats all
 Yeah
 A lot of soldiers hit on me Its no big
deal
 Traci
 Sam told me to
 It feels like were supposed to do
something
 Yeah The opportunities
 Yeah we should meet up and then search
 Can we call them Kryn please
 Thats what they actually are
 I think Jeffs a really nice name
 Jeff is a great name Keep going
 Wait wait wait What is the possibility
that your mean people can change memories
 Should I try to send him a message and
see if he responds
 Would they know
 What I do
 Well yeah but I can say Dont respond
if youre by anybody that you know
 Oh thats good What if I do that
 We only have an hour We need to get
our free food
 Was it like a worm or something
 Do you think the Kryn 
came out of the worm thing
 Seven
 Some of us are just hanging out
 I have a question When you Blink out
I havent done it very much but I feel like its
the Ethereal Plane right that we go to
 The Ethereal Plane
 Its another plane 
The Traveler told me about it
 Oh Well I feel like we go to this other
plane right You can walk through things on that
plane because its not quite the same So what if
we Blinked and then we could go through where
they collapsed the tunnel Then we could be in the
tunnel and just see you know Then come back
 Well I dont think you can do that Right
 You cant Blink if the spot is taken up right
 Im not trying to Dimension Door
That one scares me a bit
 Yeah thats what I mean We Blink right
here Then we walk where the tunnel was and we
go into the tunnel
 Or we could just do that
 This is overwhelming
 Yussas pretty powerful
 I could send him a message
 Yeah we do
 Yeah
 If you bamf forward and there is stuff
blocking the way will you get really hurt
 Thats a little different
 Right
 The tunnel is blocked
 About  feet in the tunnel is blocked
 I use Thaumaturgy and Im like
 Whoa
thats really cool Did you see it Theres a
bunch of whispers of people going
Thats so cool
 Im picturing like a didgeridoo
 Are you saying you want to look at them
 Because Yussa said we shouldnt pull it
out Especially right now if people are looking
for it it could be really bad
 If Fjord is saying that is a bit
then you know
 Brent
 Do you want me to send them a message
 Your familys still there now
 Its such a good name
 Yeah
 Its a little overwhelming I mean this is
some serious shit I mean I came from Nicodranas
and everything was nice The empire is really
fucked up Everybody went through such
horrible things and Im really sorry for
everyone Thats all
 Dont worry Nott I already have
 Im sure there is worse to come
Well get through it though
 Yeah
 I would like nice again at some point
 Yeah
 Do you want to be a halfling again
 We should talk to Yussa
Maybe he can help you
 Youre still pretty cool I mean the
coolest goblin Ive ever known
 Yeah he was wearing pretty fancy clothes
and stuff
 Or Veth Or Vott
 What are they sitting on
 Yeah Its in here
 Citadel They have a citadel
 Thats right
 Its a casino
 No that wasnt it They were saying that
they couldnt believe that Ghor Dranas was holding
secrets like that they had a whole other school
of magic that we havent discovered here
 Wow
 Yeah I remember hearing about her
 We could go after them
 We take our cart and we head straight
toward the worst of the war
Yeah that makes perfect sense
 Yeah we cant fight an entire army
 Want me to send him a message What if Im
be able to escape or something
 Oh boy
 Like what What do you want me to say
 Describe him to me
 Oh thatll work
 I can see what you saw in him
 While were going Im going to try and
send a message to Yeza
 Im a friend of Veth We know youve been
taken but stay hopeful were looking for you
If you can tell us where you are currently
 Nott hes alive He said its dark and he
has to stay quiet but thank you
 Well find him
 Want me to go
 Kids really like me
 Thanks Nott
 Stop it
 Yeah there it is I should go find Old
Edith and Im going to say what
 Theres men coming too
 Okay okay okay
 Ill go find Old Edith
 Hi Edith
 Hello
 You may remember me from the other night
I was outside Im a friend of Veth
 Yes She of course had to be on her way
because things are hard right now
but she wanted to convey her desire for you
and Lucas Lucas
  Luke to find your way to Alfield
 Because she doesnt think it is safe for
you to be here right now Now Alfield is very
safe and theres a wonderful person there named
Bryce who weve already sent word to because
were pretty powerful and theyll be expecting you
She said to use the money that she gave you
to head there and get a place to stay and use it
for food Buy yourself something nice you know
 As long as it takes because its pretty
dangerous still but we will be able to send word
to you and let you know when its safe to come
home which is good
 You should get your stuff together because
tomorrow somebody will be here to escort you
to the city
 Yeah Is there anything else I can do
for you Edith
 Okay Bryce will be looking for you
 Oh youre welcome Have a wonderful day

 Oh I rolled pretty I think I Hold on
Ive got to get back to my character

 Hit the view button Laura
 Okay Plus so  I rolled well but my
intelligence is pretty lame
 Oh like a dire badger
 Okay I want to be a dire honey badger
 
 I turn back and I go 
 Yeah Can I talk in Polymorph No Im
straight up that thing
 
 Im digging Thats what Im doing Thats
just thats what this 
 Aww It was so good and then it went to

 Yes
 Darkvision  feet yes

 You guys I think theres a river down
here
 Yeah Thats how they do it so quickly

 Yeah I pull my head back out
 What am I Who do you think I am
 Send some Dancing Lights in there
 No we took it
 Yeah
 I could draw one
 Should I cast Pass Without Trace on us and
stuff
 I cast Pass Without Trace on all of us
 God
 We are going to have to take a break
or like a long rest because
I want my thlevel spells back you guys
  Level up
 You just go Its over 
Go back to your character page
 Then you go up to level eight
 Then you go to manage HP
 Seven
 No you add six to your roll HP yeah
 Holy moly
 Thats pretty sick
 Ooh I can infuse my weapons with poison
 But its the best feat
 Are you running against him and
youre going to give that
 Going like you guys are being really
stupid
 Maybe its not the smartest idea for us to
do this is all
 I have  as well
 I am decently perceptive how about you
 Oh no Really Caduceus
 Ill stay next to you Fjord in the
front
 Good call
 I think it was going to be me and Fjord at
the front Are you perceptive
 Yasha can be at the back
 Will Nugget fit by Yasha
 Where else will I put him you know
 Where would they stay
 Okey dokey
That would be 
 Okay I have a question you guys Ive got
this supersecret dodecahedron thingy in my bag
that Yussa specifically said that we should not be
bringing near anything and stuff and now were
taking it right to the source Do you think
thats a bad idea
 Right unless they capture me and flip my
bag inside out and then they have it yeah
 I dont know
 Its in my bag as well Ive got
the whole setup going
 Right and were only fighting
an entire army of soldiers so it probably
wont happen that we will die
 Thats true Yasha you think
itll be nice
 Thats true
 Whats in this pocket o cavern Anything
cool
 Yeah its pretty
 T Top
 Are there footprints on the ground
 
 How big of a trail is the worm thing Is it
like this Is it like this
 Cool So were fighting these guys and a
giant worm creature that is ten feet in width so
hes probably kind of long
 I mean Im not going to lie Nott I am a
little bit nervous
 Yeah
 Well yeah remember what I did to Oh you
werent Remember when I turned that dragon into
that little thing Thats what I could do to a
worm I guess I did that to the dragon before you
came in you know when we almost died
 Good call
 Yeah Or something maybe like a sparrow or
something so it will fly away
 Like a dire honey badger
 Ooh thats good I like that Fjord
 Also though I cant do that until we
sleep but I dont think were going to run into
them today right Because theyre probably really
far ahead of us because they got a two week lead
 Traps too
 I wonder if theres another big pocket o
cavern coming up or if we have to sleep in this
little tunnel
 Mmhmm
 Again
 
 Magical things live here I bet
 Kill it Why would you kill it
 It was so beautiful
 Yeah lets sleep in here Is the ground

out where we are Wheres the map

 Good point
 Oh we have to find it
 I guess we should search around and
see if we can find a hole in the wall
 Follow their path or something
 I will look for a hole in the wall
 Nein Wait plus 
 Holes in the walls
 I bet the rock formations in this room
are amazing
 That one looks like a fried egg
look at that Do you see it
 Looks like an egg on the top Do you see
 I probably should
  Oh my god I should make this
a temple to the Traveler
 Yeah but think about how cool it would be

around him like sparkles and shit

 I need a heal
 I think they were a couple you guys
 I think theyve been living down here for
a long time They were this wonderful couple
  Little rock babies Maybe thats
why they were mad Maybe the crystals we took
were their rock babies What if it was their
giant baby nest and we broke their babies out
 I think were the only two that got hurt
 Then Im going to cast Cure Wounds
on myself as well at ndlevel
 Yeah no joke
 I dont think theres anything that would
really help us down here that I could paint
 Yeah I actually do have the ability to
command things but they have to be able to
understand me and I didnt think that those
rock things probably spoke our language
 Well you know we could have said
pretty please
 You dont know I could try it
 Next time
 Ooh 
 Yeah nothing can get through it anyway
 Im going to cast Sending

 Oh Beau You know what we could do
Here take this Im going to give her the
smutty book that you gave me just recently
 Wait wait wait Read it out loud
 Now we can all have entertainment
while were walking
 I mean normally it doesnt take but
 I know Thank you Caleb
 Do we hear anything coming from
the tunnels
 What were you thinking Caduceus
 I read scary books when I was little about
these creatures that lived in the mountains that
were seethrough because they lived underground
for so long but they had really long claws and
they would snatch up babies
 Im just saying maybe we should
avoid them
 What if its not a miner from the top
What if its one of the creatures that
I was talking about and this is his hammer
and the tunnel actually
 No what if its a creature that
lives in the mountain and hes got a hammer
and one of these tunnels leads to his village
under the mountain and its a whole village
of scary people thats going to
attack us as soon as we
  To go poop because
theres not really a lot of privacy
 Wait wait wait I have an idea
 What if I cast Daylight We could tie a
ribbon around Frumpkins neck I cast Daylight
on his neck on the ribbon and then
he can see wherever he goes
 Hey thats better than that
 I take a ribbon off my horn
and wrap it around Frumpkins neck
 Oh Caduceus
 He cant hear us when hes
doing these things
 Whatd you see
 How big of a creature
 Did it seem cute
 Thats a good point Fjord
 That is what were doing
 Me too
 Yeah bring him back
 Yeah Go down the little ones
 Cool
 I cast Pass Without a Trace on all
of us while we were hiding Is that okay
 Okay
 Eight
 Oh no
 Stop them
 Author extraordinaire

 How big was the worm
 Thats true its kind of
 They understand us
 No dont eat it
 I mean we shouldnt let it just die
 Im not going to trade Nugget no
 No
 I mean I dont want it to
suffer in a cage Caleb
 Lets open it up

 Also Im not a giant lizard anymore
Im not a big kobold Im me again
 Thats right I can take any form I want
 Yes Im glad everyone worships me
like they should
 I walk around dramatically for a while
 Its going to be so hard to find
wood down here in the tunnels
 Not yet no
 Oh my god
there is a clay pot hanging from that
that has an acrid smell rising from it and
another clay pot tied to a rope thats lashed
around his shoulders His weapon is a staff
with a living scorpion tied at the top of it
 Hey bees
 A natural 
 Im going to cast Command
 At second le no Yeah second level
And try to get both of them and say Stop it
 No both of the
 Yeah but its still within range
 Yes wisdom saving throw
 They both have to stop it
 I mean
 Spurt and Bex
 Oh We dont have any food
We already gave you all the food
 You guys what the fuck are you doing
 Youre so cute and stuff but like
dont attack us were really big
 Yeah no Im going to kill them
  Im not going

 Whats a centipault
 Thats awesome
 But not on us
Dont attack us okay
 Im going to open my sketchbook
and draw all of it
 Dont worry well heal you
 Thats really cool
 Is it alive
 No
 Ugh
 
 No dont beat it Poor Pep
 Stop hitting it
 Yeah
 Oh hello bees
 Hey Spurt how long have you lived down
here
  days
 Except were leading him to
a really scary place yall
 We shouldnt pull that shit out
 That could be a really bad idea Caleb
 Yeah You want to come with us
 Hey this kid thinks youre his mom
 Can we see what it is
 Oh no Spurt dont run
 I love him
 What are we rolling stealth
 I rolled an 
 Should I be rolling stealth checks
for Nugget
 How are we going to get out of here
 Ooh you know what we should do
We should mark this on the map
 We could create a diversion Hold on
let me see what kind of spells I have taken
 I bet that these people are posted here
because the Kryn came through
 Oh yeah you cant see the actual figure
 So potentially Okay I have an idea What
if Caleb you make your bubble then one of us
just yells out to the fire giants Hey We just
want to pass through we dont want to have
anything to do with you Were just chasing down
these dicks that passed through your land
thats it Then we hide in your bubble
so that they cant attack us
 Well yeah but what are we going to do
We cant all be invisible and theyre right here
 They cant get us through the bubble
 You dont think theyre going to have other
sentries posted when they leave their post
 Im just saying in the tunnel
Its just an extra bonus of being in the
tunnel and extra protection or something
 Which I dont want to do I just
want to talk to them
 Yes I could do it
 Yeah can you make it look like 
it comes from the cave and then runs off
so that it doesnt appear out of nowhere
 Or the other cave maybe no
I dont know
 Or just come out of the lava
 Oof But it could also succeed against us
and then well have to fight a giant I think it
would be better if you know I could Dimension
Door with you Caleb over to the other side
 And then we just keep going
We never engage with these fucks
 Well hes going to make a
big distraction and then we all run
 Shut up Wait which library was this
 Yeah Then we all run
 Go the distance
 Can you get that far too
 Somebody take Caleb Ill take Yasha
 Why
 Yeah Shes not large
 I could Blessing Of The Trickster
you here and that way youre a little
more stealthy as youre going
 I could Polymorph someone
 Into something that you know
 Yeah That can get across I could
Polymorph I could Polymorph you
and I could Dimension Door me and Yasha
 One of us needs to take Yasha
one of us needs to take Caleb
 Ill take Yasha
 I thought you could go farther than that
Fjord thats not as far
 Wait How about I take Caleb the entire
distance you and Yasha bamf  feet and run
because Caleb is squishy
 Do you want to be Polymorphed
 Okay well I wont be able to
Polymorph you once youre out
 Do you keep your intelligence
when youre polymorphed
 Here Beau
 Dont take it out just let it in
 Okay Im going to Blessing Of The
Trickster you Youre still super stealthy
I dont know if it matters
 What
 Nuggets just going to run out and hes
going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can
 Yeah Hes going to be fine
 It gives you advantage on stealth checks
 He was so cute
 Okay what should I make you
What do you want to be
 Maybe a dragonfly could be really cool
 Okay Well if youre a dragonfly will
you remember what youre supposed to do
 If you cast Polymorph If I were to cast
it on myself I would remember what I was doing
 No Sprinkles in my pocket
 I actually have a question Matt
 When I Dimension Door I can take
another creature
 Does that mean I cant have Sprinkle on me
or else I wont be able to take Caleb
 Okay Im going to take Sprinkle off out
of my hood Okay Beau Take care of Sprinkle
 No its okay Sprinkle Just hold onto him
when you run okay Dont let him get left behind
 Its Sprinkle hes my weasel
 Nuggets going to blink blink blink
 Polymorph
 Polymorph
 Plus its expecting something
to come out the door
 Its right at the top of your
If you hit Spells itll say at the top
 What is it Is it a natural 
 Are they looking at each other
 Should we
 Do we have any other thingies
 Hold on
 Well should we just wait
until it dies down then go
 Natural 
  plus four 
 Who would attack the cow
 What did Yasha roll
 Hey Caleb Polymorph happens
immediately so you can do it again
 Oh youre at the bottom
 Im going to run up grab Caleb and
Dimension Door to the other side
 Nuggets going to run and starts running
out and fucking blinking as well oh my god
 Oh no hes so cute
 With the oh we did
 You can go  feet
 He is going straight through the lava
But theres a bridge
 The cow gets you
 Low damage to the cow
 Roll three ones three ones
 Youre invisible
 And I blessed you
 It gives you advantage on stealth
 How long can you stay invisible
 But with Blessing of the Trickster it might
be balanced out because you get advantage on
 Does that drop your invisibility
once youre hit
 Yeah shes still invisible
 Big fire giants they are really
 Sure Yes I am going to
 Yeah Im going to just pop my head
and out and see whats happening
 And Im going to cast Jesus
 Fuck Okay Im not concentrating
anymore Im going to Invoke Duplicity
 Im going to send my duplicate
 feet in front of me
 And then Im going to make her run out and
leap over the lava and land on the other side
 And then shes going to act like
shes readying for the fight
and getting ready to cast something
 Okay
 God fucking dammit Seven
 You dont know where Nott went
 You could prep a healing for
when you see Nott
 Saving throw
 If she would have rolled a one
would she be in the lava
 No
 Can you leap on the
crumbled bridge parts
 Lava fire damage is what
youre looking up right now
 I remember this being
ludicrously horrible
 And that was before we
did the full lava damage
 Yeah
 I got a better plan
 Do you have the ability
to roll back time
 Okay
 Yeah Im going to run up with my duplicate
and cast Inflict Wounds at rdlevel
 Just kick him
  plus eight 
 d Oh  
 points
 Thats yeah I mean
thats all I could do
 Or no that was my action
 Heal Nott or put the fire out or something
You guys can put the fire out on Nott at least
 Oh my goodness gracious
Here lay the chunks  Of a kobold named Spurt 
He beat his skunks  So they wouldnt squirt 
He feared no foes  And snacked on scat 
But against a giants blows  He soon went splat

 That was lovely
 Also poster and prints in the store now
Art prints Im still talking like Jester
and we still have our awesome shirt
