 This has been great
 Neither did I
 But here we are A lavender damn it
Travis A lavender tiefling with red eyes and very
pierced extremely ostentatious horns that are
pierced with little gems and little baubles Hes
got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side
of his face a peacock tattoo that goes off into
his very ostentatious ridiculous overblown robes
that he wears His two swords and pouch dangling at
the side of his hips Hes very broad in his
dress
 Oh yes
 I know mine Who knew
 I didnt say my name
 Can I tell if where are they in the
dispensement of the coin Can I tell they have a
little coin on them Did I catch any of that

good time to go out have a laugh see things that
you have never seen before and my god take my
word for it one months time people will be
buying your ale to hear the tale of what you saw
at the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities this night

silver it would be a steal at five gold Worth
every penny But if youve got the five copper to
spend we would happily have you all

an intermediary for these parts I do on occasion
perform I can read fortunes

complicated reading

 On the house
 Some of our acts are a little
complicated with performers who are not of the
traditional variety Can make some of the locals
get a little shifty if you know what I mean and
its good to have a few people around who are
capable of keeping issues contained
 We cannot be held responsible for
anything that may happen to someone who is ill or
infirm It is such an exciting impressive show

tiefling and thank you for keeping this rabble in check
 One on the house And I pull two cards
 I pull the Moon and I pull the Shadow
Does this mean anything to you
 Well think about it Put it away
 Such grace Such form Such dignity
 Weirdly being part of the show means
you strangely pay more Im not entirely sure how
that works
 I know Highly entertained

 Its a very swaddling hug Youve never
experienced anything like it
 Bring a cushion from home like a regular
person
 Everyone get out right now
 Oh my god its so pretty
 No go for it Oh boy
 Ten
 Oh youve got toys
 Ten
 Im going to yell to the back open the
tent wide And Im going to pull how far away am I
  Im going to run around and see
if I can flank that creature if I can move
towards flanking that creature with the other
two
 All right Can I get close enough to
take a shot
 Well old habit

 As a bonus Im flipping it out and Im
going to activate the first sword
 And Im taking a shot at the creature
 Taking a slice
 Thats  to hit
 Thats not bad Thats eight points of
damage and one point of ice damage
 No that was my bonus
 Yeah no Im going to use Blood
Maladict
 Oh thats right because Im not
doubling it up
 Im still engaged with it right Okay
Im going to take two swipes
 Purples the ice Thats the purple is
 to hit
 Ooh So they both hit so thats good
So thats going to be or all three then because
the other one is  to hit
 The first one is four points of damage
 Im sorry the magic one is six points
plus three ice so nine points
 The other one is four points of damage
 Four points of damage
 Someone anyone Yep
 Just kill it
 One of them turned I dont know what
happened
 Im going to drop my sword
 Oh wherever will I go
 Weve never seen anything like it
before He just he gripped his heart and fell
over and turned into that thing
 Nothing like this
 I feel that that was entirely
coincidental Im really not sure that the two
things were related Something was wrong with this
man
 Weve seen her sing dozens hundreds of
times Nothing like this has ever happened Ive
seen people sit in the front row hundreds of
times Nothing like this has ever happened
 Gustav
 Hold up Ive never seen that one
before He looks really suspicious
 No the guy behind him
 Sure Eight
 Well weve already killed two of them
 Wow hes really shook up
  Gustav its no use weve
been found out Our terrible plot to make a zombie
rampage through our carnival has been discovered
Whatever will we do now that weve been discovered
for our brilliant plot to make a zombie ruin our
circus My god
 Im literally holding nothing but my
hands
 It ruined our show
 Nope
 Try not to stab any random people on
your way there Flynn Youre doing good
 Im so excited this is great
 Truer words were never spoken
 I kept the Gil die
 Fuck you
 Traveling Carnival of Curiosities
 Id like to make a counteroffer
 Youll be fine
 I think maybe it has nothing to do with
us I think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire
 Sorry sir Trying to keep my mouth
shut
 Exactly how did we kill them exactly
 Thank you Yes you see
 Oh are you waiting for me to speak
Yes hes the only one
 Natural  About fucking time you
little shit
 No Just shocked to see someone die in
front of me not more than
 Its the one accent that I really have
trouble with
 Bastard
 The one that we know is a problem
 This has never anything like this has
ever happened before And thank you For the
record I dont owe any of you anything
 I swear but thank you and Im ready
to help with this
 No Thats an act thats not anything
Its just a show
 Its nothing special its just a guy
making a buck all right Hes fine
 By the way wheres the obnoxious one
The really loud
 Is this part of the show by the way I
was just curious
 Im going to be very helpful and not go
in there with the two of you while you try and get
her out
 Ill stand guard
 I have nowhere to go
 How many kittens is that again
 She didnt
 Youre putting your neck out for Toya
for some strange reason and I dont know why
shes perfectly capable of handling herself
 Not that I can remember They all look
the same after a while
 Busy yeah
 Nothing like this Hundreds possibly
thousands of shows Yeah thousands of shows
Nothing Never Its not us
 Which other two
 Oh your friends
 You call them Stinky and the little one
All right
 Thank God
 If Im going to listening to somebodys
life story Im going to need a drink You
gorgeous whats your name
 Adelaine I would like a round for all
these terrible people and one for myself Whats
the difference between these three beers Ive
honestly got to admit they all taste the same to
me
 Lets get a round of von Brandt for
everybody
really an ale fan Do you have any fire whiskey
 I dont know Im going to ask for one
of each of these beers because I want to have a
tasting competition Im not going to be drinking
alone
 Howd you etch a deck in the table
 Oh
 You think thats what they look like
 Im already in my cups
 Shes blue
 Its very true
 Im from the circus
 Oh yeah Quite a while
 Long as I can reasonably remember at the
very least Its been a while Its nice I like
it Theyre good people Work hard
 Thats a very funny story actually
 Me too
 Thank you These swords you buy a
drink and well see
 How much I owe you for the first round
 Mother always told me to never give a
story away for free
 I already like your mother
 I can tell
 Im going to join you on this one
 
 Theres only one way to find out
 Im looking at her waist Whats on her
waist
 Im going to guess ten
 I want to hear you say it anyway
 Thats  days
 Its the second button
 Sorry Drinking I did order two extra
Two extra
 Youre no fun
 Are you trying to learn magic Is that a
thing
 Hes family
 We take care of each other Hes a good
man
 Well they have all my things and they
have all my family Im going to figure out what is
going on Try and find out whats actually doing
this I assume since its none of us its going
to happen again
 Well I
 Im sure if we sleep on it well think
of something
 Thats fair
 A bit yeah
 Where exactly am I going to be sleeping
by the way I can sleep down here but it might be nice
 Excellent You dont mind Im going to
pull the swords off finally and start getting
comfortable out of the performance clothes
 There is a button for it
 All but the one you bought me
 To be fair I didnt give you that
story
 I very carefully start unfolding my robe
and it has my swords very carefully laid out in
there from the closet I do a little prayer and
put everything back on
 I am of course
 You seem honest
 Well the swords are magic According to
my mum they go back in our family generations to
a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came
from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano
Our family and I take this with a grain of salt
were royal guards were entrusted with these magic
swords and these swords can only be activated by
the blood of the royal family So in honor of any
fighting I ever do with them I make sure my blood
is at least drawn once
 What am I fighting against
 That would be deception All right Im
lying like a motherfucker
 I walk downstairs
 Ive already gone Im having breakfast
Im leaving a note with the barkeep for Yasha if
she comes back
 Well I mean look at me I go into my
bag I do have a disguise kit Dont I I think I
do Its so weird to just have things now Yeah I
have a disguise kit
 Itd be a little tricky for me I 
look like what Im going to look like
But the rest of you could do a little work
 We could just shower this one that would
be enough
 I tend to find these things dont blow over
necessarily as more they just eventually decide
someones guilty and take their revenge on them
 Not this particular one but yes
 None taken really A little taken but
thats fine
 Shes right immediately the two of us
are going to get hit with this
 Do you want assistance with this
 Oh with advantage
 I assume Ive just got some very basic
black robe that just
 Im sure Ive got a set
 Yes please this is a lot of work Its
a natural  thatll do it
 Now Im kicking myself
 No never mind I didnt do it at the
time I cant do it now No retconning never
mind
 Has Adelaine noticed any of this
 Lets call that a
  thank you
 I go single just a little bit after and
I rolled a natural 
 Yep
 It seems to be iron like my will
 Me and my magic swords
 Who was he would be my question
 Seems to be the most appropriate thing
to ask at this point
 These small towns most everyone knows
everybody else
 Were the Logans Run of DD
 Retired fisherman
 Do we know where he was retired from and
where he was staying maybe where he was drinking
He had to go somewhere
 Is that with the weird e spelling
 Im always a fan
 Ye olde Its pronounced the when you
see the ye
 The what
 Is this a metaphor or is this actually a
real thing
 I was doing my rounds
 Weve been doing a pub crawl
 I down my shot What did the man drink
out of curiosity What was his final drink Im a
bit of a macabre person myself
 Ill take one more and Ill get one of
my own
 We got a reader While theyre doing
this Im going to saunter over to the card
player
 Not there at all
 I just sat down for a moment with this
solitaire player
 They say that solitaire is the game for
the deathobsessed Theres inevitability to every
hand most of them are doomed from the start no
matter what you do Any interest to buck fate and
try your hand at an opponent for once No money
just friendly
I slide the rest of my whiskey over
 Ive been called worse
 Im just a man who saw another man die
yesterday Its been heavy on my conscience and I
was just wondering if there was anything you could
tell me about Enon
 Im regretting it myself
 Has he Thats not what other people
have said
 Why do you think he went Why do you
think that happened to him
 Fuck the circus So thats what you
think happened to him then I feel like theres
something evil afoot
 Again Ive been called worse Sure you
have in your time as well
 I take my cup back Down it I love
small towns
 Awfully convenient
 That rules been around for as long as I
can remember because it makes people think the
shows dangerous Gives them a thrill
 Were not really worried about people
having a heart attack we want people to be
worried about having a heart attack because then
theyre more excited to come see the show This is
how these shows work
 Before my time
 Its a boilerplate
 If you were trying to hide doing
something to someone its a great candidate If I
was trying to get away with something terrible
idea
 Wait what
 What kind of weird
 Start at the docks but Ill keep that
in mind
 I was about nope nevermind
 I was about to be very impressed but I
take it back
 What does usta mean
 Very good
 Id like to avoid the guards for as long
as possible
 Im comparing the snake to the snake
thats tattooed on my hand to try and get the
heads to be the exact same size
 You think anyone would have wanted him
marked or harmed in some way
 This is just a snake This is a big
weird snake Im looking at
 No Ive been looking at the snake this
entire time
 Nine
 Looks like mine
 Much bigger
 Id say the docks are his home if we
could figure out where he lived
 He was last seen at the circus
 You dont happen to know what happened
to his son by any chance
 I take the compliment Im putting it my
pocket Im keeping it for later
 Well shes making friends with
everybody I dont see any of you making friends
 Were you being sarcastic oh no you
werent okay Catching up on that
 Only the pure of heart make their answer
out of riddles Back to the tavern
 Youre going to probably you know
poof
 I can maybe put a rope through the
window
 I got rope
 Ill go through the front like a proper
person
 Right and then Im going to drop some
of the rope out the back window for them
   feet of hemp rope its a
standard
 How
 Youre already so ahead though
 We are at DD Jury Duty
 Im sitting playing with the cards
 Any progress
 That was a power move right there
 No you know what Im going to take
it
 How long have you known this one
 Anybody whos watching this happen
 That explains a lot
 I feel like there should be some more
gossip then there is thats very true
 I leave the rope tied in here Can we
use your cat Reel it back up in so that theres
no trace of us until we need to get back there
 No Im telling you that your cat is
going to haul up a rope
 Its not that heavy of a rope its just
hemp
 Well if I throw it back up there then I
imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very
least
 I assume hes an asshole cat Arent all
cats asshole cats
 I assume hes going to thats fair
 Not that big of a town
 Theres three rooms and they all have
windows
 Oh for gods sake I pull out a big
thing of string
 Oh well then Im taking my string
back
 Im going to do one last thing before we
leave which is just tussle the room a bit so it
looks like its been robbed Just in case they do
come in
 
 
 Im just going to try to meditate on the
strange death and see if I can feel anything
 All right Just see how this goes
 
 Maybe we have to go back to the circus
 Its early enough maybe we should
just
 I hate to admit it but maybe its not
us
 Its like an emoji
 Is math or something
 Seven
 Im in my black hood Ive got my hood
up now
 We are just the worst This is just
terrible
 Its where we camp
 Theyre not going to talk to you without
me so Im coming too
 Im fabulous
 Im going with the girls because the
circus kids wont talk to them without me
 No
 
 Which of the tents is currently
occupied
 Toya and Kylre share a tent thats
right It would be Desmond
 We have a wagon
 We were told to set it up here if I
recall
 That sounds right If I recall we were
specifically told to set up tent right here
 Whats the easiest tent to get to
without
 I want to go with whatevers furthest
away from the guards
 Whats the easiest to get to without
 Im going to go back there and do our
traditional 
 Yuli Its Mona and Yuli Im going to
try one of the other tents Am I getting the sense
that any of them are in
 Over here
 Im going to very gently lift the back
of the tent up and not go in through the front
And just
  Do you know whats going
on  Assume were
whispering because this is bullshit
 How is it Whats happened
 I could be worse
 They couldnt be worse And then Yasha
Yashad I dont know Did Toya see anything Did
she say anything
 No Ive picked up a few scragglers
Theyre idiots but theyre helping
 What do they think happened What are
they asking
 What would be the point
 Yashas the newest but she can be
flighty
 Youve never met it Well nevermind
 Oh God thats a new thing now
 Circus shitty
 In a tent over there
 Is everybody still here Theyve not
taken anyone away other than
 Were carnival people weve all got our
issues You dont end up here if youre not
a little weird
 Oh for fucks sake Im going to do my
best
 Im going to quietly sneak out the back
of the tent again and sneak into the
 Oh god I hate all of this
 
 With advantage
 Im not going to make the noise Im just
going to
 Were going to go in the tent
 
 Thats what Im trying to figure out
what the fuck is going on Theyre with me its
been complicated Gustavs in deep Bosuns in
deep
 What did you see I dont know
 This is Ornna I assume
 Ornna is the fire dancer
 For fucks sake theyre going
to kill every last fucking one of us unless
we figure this out
 What do you think
 I dont know I think that theyre
trying to cover something
 Oh god I miss Pass Without a Trace so
much
 Thats a number
 Thats so good
 Im going to have a tiny bit of
conversation with her
 Her names Beau Shes helping shes
awful you have a lot in common
 Im going to walk by the two twins
because Im circling the tent trying to get a
look and be like Ive absolutely been talking
shit Youre both terrible I give them both a
kiss on the head and keep walking
 They may not let us leave They may be
killing us all
 Theyre weird out there Theyre very
weird out there
 Ornnas in the tent with us
 While youre talking to the twins Ill
be talking to Ornna Oh for fucks sake
 Its not fucking Gustav
 Its like shes never experienced
boredom Its very weird
 Hey Ornna
  I mean I know your feelings on
all this What do you think
 Really
 What exactly would you have done
 They were useless
 Well thats on me and Thats on me
 They would
 Ornna Ornna
 Ive got a little iPad button on the
back of my pen its quite nice
 Ornna you might as well come clean
this is classic you
 Im just trying to
 Oh fuck you too Its no secret that
Ornna and Gustav have their differences but this
ridiculous I mean she knows damn well that half
the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested
and died
 But this is not his style
 I just grab
 What do you mean evil kind of vibe
 Hes what
 Thats just a name Its not actually
like real thing That just

 What do you
 I grab and push you down into the ground
and hold you  Not yet
 Girls were not supposed to be here

  Well do what we can If
something goes wrong nudity usually works

 Eight Thats a number
 It was such a good idea
 I dont want to be a fucking zombie
 They did run by
 Oh fancy
 Everything
 Im going to burst out of the tent Can
I make it to the one that Beau is fighting
 Im going to make it to the one that
Beau is fighting and Im going to take two
straight attacks with my scimitar
 Thats a  and a natural 
 Without even figuring out yeah
 Natural  is just double the die
right
 First one is  
 No double I have to roll two dice
right
 Okay thats fine Thats nine points of
damage Then two dice or double the dice
 Thats  points of damage
 I turn and smile at Beau
 Its a pizza pie with a pizza slice I
turn  and get ready for the other one
 I make eye contact with it and fuck it
just for fun Im going to burn my blood maledict
Theres going to be a blood vessel that pops on my
neck and Im going to make him cry
 I take three damage
 Im amplifying
 No
 It still hits Thats fine
 Ow
 Theres no way were going to be
able to take this shit seriously
 Im going to take two more shots Im
going to see if I can decapitate
 Oh man Ive got to get out of that
habit
 Two more swings see if I can decapitate

some such thing
 Yeah fire resistance
 Out but not dead
 Ive just started working on a new
character tonight Thank god
 
 
 One of them has my sword embedded in
their chest

 Theyre okay
 Really
 Are you going to name it Sally
 I had that coming
 Im going to pull my sword back out and
start trying to get the horses going
 That really hurt
 I feel terrible
 I can do that I can do that
 No Im fine Im going to actually fall
back into the cart
 Everything that youve been holding back
for years now is going to come pouring out of you
Okay
 Trying to take as much of a short rest
as I can back there Im going to try and sleep
this off like a bad hangover
 Like dogs we never looked up
 That would be a very big toad
 The wagon tracks directly to the point
at which they are found
 Who are you
 Thats really clever Why would you even
think that
 Huh
 Maybe I dont know Ill think about
it
 Ow that hurts Ow
 That was a lot
 Well this will break my short rest
 How many people in the boat
 How many people are we looking for
 Didnt he leave with a
 Two people
 Im actively tracking this creature
arent I on a certain level
 I hadnt really thought about it Its
something I can in theory do
 No This would also break my short rest
wouldnt it
 Im going to use Hunters Bane really
quickly and look at the track for a second
 Yeah Im going to do both of those
 Now Im at  hit points
 Yay  hit points Im going to see if I
can help with the tracking because Im going to
start actively tracking this particular creature
 Survival check Which I have advantage
on
 
 Guy went into the water
 Do you think hes trying to swim all the
way to the other side or you think hes just going
around the lake
 I dont know Im not sure Maybe Could
be
 I legitimately do not know how it works
Sorry
 Do I know what he was by the way
 And I get advantage on that
 Religion check 
 This whole time Ive been sitting with
this
 Are you saying this out loud
 Listening to this I reach in 
Ive got some incense
 Isnt this impressive enough that I
happen to have some incense
 Thered also be a fire inside the inn
to be fair Charcoal is its not like its hard to get
 Thats true you can go shopping more
 Lets go maintain the illusion of
innocence for the evening
 Xhorhas Its a creature from Xhorhas
Im pretty sure I dont know Well see
God Im remembering something
 Im going to walk over to the horses and
theyre trained horses
 Im going to go whisper in their ear and
give them a little pat
 Nine
 I didnt get advantage on that because I knew
the animals did I
 Im into this
 This is Romper Room
 Natural 
 Look at all that stuff
 I cant even see myself with this
roll
 Technically my stealth would be 
 When you hit long rest it should
autoreset
 Slightly hotter okay
 Way hotter
 Any toad creatures
 Oh the first piece of paper of the
game
 Have you read it now Whats it say
 Kylres been around for a while though
And this is new right I feel like Was there nothing
 I mean not that well Of everybody the
least
 Thats a
 I have heard that word before
 Oh dear Oh why cant I remember It
was so long ago
 What did he eat
 He ate what we had
 I feel like I wouldve taken note of it
I dont necessarily know I wouldve commented on
it but I wouldve noted it
 And it was not noted
 Oh no
 Its not possible hes trying to head
back to Xhorhas is it I said out loud
 Kylre was not a talker
 Stabbing
 Can I also do this Im thinking about
everything I hear
 Nine
 Clusters of semen all around you
 Always funny Always
 Wait what
 You could read that other book at the
very least
 I go into my bag and Ive got some old
weird Ive got a weird little
 Its in a very strange ornate bag
thats covered in strange gems and weird filigree
 Sandalwood Its nag champa all over
 Enough about the pastries already
 Yes of course
 Im in for a penny Im going to throw
a gold in there as well
 I just saw Jester open her purse
Dear
 The ten minutes is cleanup

 Go ahead
 Hes a little feathery Frumpkin
 You look like a princess
 Well if we can send the sparrow out we
can carry him with us if he finds anything
 Lets let the sparrow see if it can find
anything Then we know which direction we have to
head into so theres not too much meandering
about
 Until theres a direction to go
 PlayDoh weve got PlayDoh
 Well were not going to get our deposit
back
 That makes it worse
 Its pretty fancy
 Ill keep with you
 Id forgotten about that
 We were in the middle of things
 Its usually Gustav If somebodys got
an act they show it off Gustav figures out how
its going to work into the narrative Puts it all
together
 You bring a bit and then the bit is
shaped and formed by the director of the show If
you can do a thing with fire or you can do some
juggling and then they figure out how thats
going to work into everything Where it sits and
what costuming and the whole thing is all an act
Mostly Mostly an act
 Oh youre thinking of Toya and Kylre
They were an act before They were an act for as
long as I can remember right
 Yeah Ive never not known them as an
act
 Im feeling like maybe that might be a
thing
 Well I mean everyones got some weird
Were weird people People come in and youre a
bit strange you got something you can do
 No
 No
 Well thats a complicated conversation
but no
 She is a little girl to be fair
 Toyas not a fullygrown adult woman
 Shes a dwarf
 That is so offensive
 I think youre right but I dont know
how hes managed to go this long Why now and why
in front of all those people
 I think he is a fiend I think he is
feeding off her The rest of it Im not sure
 Have you met us Were all a bit weird
and you dont ask a ton of questions
 There is Its the difference between
being in a carnival and not being in a carnival
 Because Im weird
 I mean its putting together He was
never that talkative I dont know I dont like it
 Well
 I am not the right kind of talker for
this
 Why does every roll have to be Oh
thank god
 
 This is why we dont have you as DM
 We can also follow the bird
 I miss the earrings

 TwoGold Bold

find any footprints

 Im specifically looking for signs of
Kylre

before the blood even begins to pour it goes
straight into ice along the blades
 Action bonus action
 Action and bonus action
 I cant turn an action to a bonus
action
 All right thats fair
 Okay
 Im going to move around and Im going
to try and get a little cover right here
 Im going to move there and Im going
to hold my attack until theres something to hit
Im going to try and make a little wave at Yasha
Toya Ah brain
 Yeah
 
 Im so proud of you
 What Hexblades Curse

so useful So useful
 Yep that hit me

 Actually is it close enough to me that
I would have taken a swipe at it anyways
 Thats a 
 Thats a d plus d Thats eight
damage plus one cold damage so nine damage
 Five points of damage and a constitution
saving throw
 Constitution saving throw
Goddamn it 
 So I just took
 Thats a lot
 Im going to use my bonus action take a
slash at that imp I can only use it as an action
right
 Okay Ill burn my attack hitting that
bloody imp
 No Ill hit it with the enchanted one
 Im really hurt and I just took nine
points of damage
 Yeah  to hit
 Thats seven points of damage
 Im going to pull back behind this tree
trunk then and get a little cover to figure out
what to do next because Im really hurt
 Yeah I cant heal or anything My god
I cant do anything
 
 Ah learning
 Jesus these things are so vicious
 Oh my god
  Shit
 Im going to get a little closer Im
going to start running towards the ruins
 Thatll do it Im going to look at the
imp and Im in Infernal Im going to say to
here Im going to attack Vicious Mockery on him
and show him the bottom card
 I have to learn some Yeah thats a
 Yeah its a wisdom saving throw
 Im trying to figure out how this works
but
 Its not a lot but thats four points
of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on the
next attack roll it makes
 That was just my bonus action Im going
to use my action
 No thats a it is an action youre
right Thats what Ive got right now Just trying
to get its attention
 Oh my god Were not doing well
 Hes the only one whos down but were
all hurt
 Oh god no
 Fuck man
 Glad you didnt do Detect Evil
 He cant follow you
 Both have disadvantage
 Vicious Mockery
 Part of the plan
 You have so few actions
 Does that work
 There is no body
 We need a body
 Oh thank god Is that imp still there
Is the imp still active
 Im going to Blood Maledict Im going
to Curse of the Eyeless on that imp
 The one that is attacking Nott
 Oh for fucks sake
 Im running at the closest imp Can I
get there
 All right Im going to take two
swings
 For fucks sake Nope That was a ten
 Can you bonus action anybody
 Stabilize someone
 Thats smart
 You could dash
 She has got two more rounds regardless
 Yay
 How are you doing man
 This is oh man one imp is going to
kill us all One fucking imp
 We have to stabilise Fjord is what
weve got to do
 Caleb Calebs doing okay
 Im running right at it
 Lets try some different dice here
For fucks sake Ive got to stop rolling that
die This is yeah no
 
 This is so embarrassing
 This is so embarrassing
 Do you get advantage because Im engaged
with it
 Ugh look at it scoot God
 I was about to say Im going to run to
Toya and pick her up Ive got her Ive got her
 Ive got her
 Because you were the last face she saw
I should probably be the first Thank you You did
the right thing You dont need to be the first
thing she sees Shell just start screaming all
over again Thank you
 Were going to need him
 Thats definitely a cloister Its a
nugget
  Get her back home
 I know Were going to have a talk
 I dont know if she feels that way
either but although its going to take some
time I think And also were going to need the
body and honestly only one of us was here For
those at home Im pointing at Caleb
 Because the rest of us are under
arrest
 So congratulations on singlehandedly
defeating the creature that killed several guards
Im sure you will be wellrewarded and
compensated
 Lets take a rest
 That was so unpleasant
 I think Im going to multiclass
 Master of none
 I think we need to bring it I think were
going to need a trophy
 Thatll do
 Im going to give the body a quick
search to see if theres anything
 Do I recognize any of these rings
 All right Thats disturbing
 Suppose I should
 Im going to try and carve off the head
 This is as far as I go one this one
Thats way too heavy for me
 Im going to grab Toya
 I think thats a very good idea
 I did share meals with this person for
two straight years Never mind Im walking away
 Im already walking away I took the kid
and am walking to the boat
 Youre the worst Youre all the worst
 I know dear Youve been through a bit
Theres been some bad business
  A friend turned on us but its
going to be all right Im going to get you home
all right
 Ill explain it later
 Oh yeah
 Youre a monster
 No its not that bad
 Ive got some new stuff coming in
 Coming in from the Feywild
 Oh Can I reroll
 Then thats nine
 I know Its going to be a bit rough
but it was for the best Im so sorry Some people
just turn Im so sorry
 He got sick There was something inside
him There was something that made him
do some bad things but it had to be taken care
of Youre going to be all right
 Biggest frog youve ever seen
 I was trying to keep her away from
that
 The Barney that been raising her yes
Really take that in Off to a great start
 Im trying to keep her quiet
 You should
 Im going to take her to the front of
the boat and keep her far away from all that
 Ive been listening I pull out a gold
coin Give him this
 And now theres a little girl Its all
coming full circle
 Ill let that go
 Took a lot out of us
 If you see us we wont make eye
contact
 Its a shame we didnt just get rid of a
wagon not more than one night ago
 Someone else may get to it or something
might happen
 What could people do with the head of a
creature like this
 Would I know
 For the moment
 We need to get this one back to the
circus too You might be helpful for that
 Im hoping Toya will
 She knows what to say when guards are
asking questions
 Shes had a bad night
 Well have a talk Well get her to some
people who can calm her down and make sure she
remembers how we take care of each other
 Sorry dear I was hoping that we didnt
have to have this conversation in front of strangers
 It turns out that that was Kylre did
that
 I dont know why Something snapped
Hes hurt and killed a lot of people We think
that maybe hes been making you sick too
 Gustav is having trouble with the
authorities Were going to need to all work
together to save him
 The twins are being the twins Ornnas
being Ornna But I think we can save everybody We
just need to take care of each other
 I felt it
 No I want to hear this too
 Somehow that was better than what I was
hoping for
 You know how people outside can be The
mean girl was just afraid of you and were going
to let her go on this one
 Yeah I know Lets get you home okay
 Choked you with my stick
 That was certainly memorable
 This is so weird
 Are you
 Its like a napkin on a buffalo
 Take her right back No one can know
that shes been anywhere
 Well explain to her what needs to be
done
 We still have people in the lockup
 Ill be back and I have to show back up
with you people anyway Im going to get her as
quickly as possible
 I wouldnt say no to it before I take
off
 Thats canon
 What is my stealth bonus now
 Level two
 Were going to die from bad paperwork
 Literally were going to die from bad
paperwork
 
 Oh shite Not even a good push to get
her underneath just back into one of the tents
or no
 Yeah I dont know theyre caught do
I
 Im going to try and wait for an
advantageous moment
 Ooh 
 You remember Nothing happened Find
Ornna You didnt see me You just hid and waited
and you didnt know that anything was wrong If
people ask unless you hear from me you dont
know anything
 Im going to start heading back to the
inn
 Nice
 Hmm 
 Im going to get a little closer
 Just to take a look at what is actually
going on
 Not too close
 
 Oh whats the play Whats the play
Ah Im going to
Yeah fuck it Im going to walk up
 With briskly There I find you
Ive been looking everywhere
Youre not supposed to leave 
the bloody inn you oh
 Theyre already in trouble apparently
 All right Less questions to answer
 Dance number
 Xhorhas
 I just whisper Xhorhas
 Lot of help you were
 Youre right We do protect our own
Thats absolutely true
 Its a common tactic Its a good way to
make your way through this world Normally it
works We assumed the circus anyway that we
were being framed We were protecting our own Is
the head in here
 This one showed his true colors and
then we took care of it Im going to throw one of
my swords down on the ground that is filthy with
its blood
 Oh shit 
 We needed someone on the outside We
knew we were innocent We knew you didnt think
so We just assumed you were going to have us all
executed and we didnt do anything What would you
have done
 In his defense its a wonderful
vintage Her defense
 Shame
 I dont know That is a question
 Gold comes gold goes
 I dont know how much the circus has and
honestly I think Ornna would lie about it if we asked
 Well the twins buggered Ornna God
only knows
 Toya is back at the circus but shaken
Very shaken
 How hard can it be to make  gold
 How hard can it be to steal  gold
 Maybe be best to find that gold
elsewhere
 Suppose we should take a look at whats
left of the circus
 I will definitely drink I think we
should probably drink at our camp then Im fine
inviting them
 Is this a human thing to never mind
 I know
 Kylre went bad Maybe hed already
always been bad I dont know
 Lets not be throwing words around
 He did summon
 He was fine for years Something set him
off
circus are weird right So every once in a
while a glitch
 He was fine for so long There was
nothing for so long Why Things dont just
 Maybe
 Everything gives me the heebie jeebies
 Shite
 She is not good She is taking it as you
would expect
 Thats true With her stick
 Always
 Shes the charm she has to come
 See charm Drink
 He is very funny
 Arm wrestle
 So Youve got to be putting something
on the table though Well if you want to
surrender the sword or not surrender the sword
  Never
 Thats a stupid game
 Get no blame from me
 Ah cheers to that
 Not our best show
 You have plans
 I dont know Im thinking about it I
dont know where Im going to end up now
 The biggest ones a bit
 You could make a lot of dresses out of
that tent Thats fair
 Thank you
 I dont
 I want to spy the rings on her hand by
the way really quickly
 I want to look at the other rings she
picked up not that shes wearing right now
 They are obviously rings from random
dead people arent they
 Okay Im just putting that together
 I think I will
 Hmm Im not quite done with this one
Well see
 Its true
 Oh no shes had a thing the entire
time There was a little while I thought she was
in on it completely
 Ive known her for years I just assumed
that she was in on it
 Yeah That would be great
 You know no matter what you pick
youre always welcome right
 Wherever you end up
 Northeast Ive always wanted to go
there
 Traditionally you have to go to a map
maker
 We might have a bit of something at the
circus I dont know
 Insight check
 Five or six months ago
 
 All right
 Thank you
 Its true
 Northwest
 Id be happy keeping a bit of a lowkey
existence
 Some of us are a bit sketchy with the
law
 Well I figured if youre going to live
your life youre going to live your life
 Does do that Theres nothing wrong with
living your life You only get one of them or
mostly And your days are going to be the days
that youre going to have and Id like to keep
living my life the way Id like to and keep off of
certain radars
 Stupid phrase
 Really stupid
 Thats just ridiculous

 That felt so good Thats catharsis
 Clam space
 You smell fine
 You should probably get that patched up
actually though That is fair
 Im all right with that Collect our
things from my things anyway from the circus
There should be some spares
 Take me a while to pack
 Note note note
 We dont care Were not that attached
yet
 More mine more mine
 Everybody at home grab your ticket you
got in the mail Scratch off number three

 Quiet dignity and grace
 It was string and mime
 Id like to see the other guy
 You know if the monks beat you up to
make them join your gang theyre not really your
friends
 Is that why they did that to your face
there Oh no they didnt Apparently they were
pretty
 Fuck all
 
 Meet us at the circus
 Im going to pack up and head back to
the circus Start getting things together
 Ill meet you there Actually you know
what I want to see you see that map
 Its gorgeous Its fabulous
 No Im going map hunting
 Or if she can draw us a map of how to
get there
 This is beautiful
 Were going to Goonies this really
quickly here Ready
 Take a look its amazing
 You live in a serpent
 If you pull out a real medikit now Im
going to be really excited  bandages come
flying in
 Medikit
 I like the idea of you just
standing there going 
 Well thats the question
 are we going
to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus
 Like one of the little vardos Can we
snag a vardo
 Im very wary of this but fine
 Sword jugglers
 Level two
 Healing potions aside you are doing
something really interesting and exciting here
Youre not a healing potion dealer What are you
doing here Like this is fascinating
 I dont know I feel like you can excite
me I feel like theres something that you have to
show thats really exciting Im not entirely sure
its all about stamina I think youve got
something you did that on purpose Talk to me
like Im a child show me something Ive never
seen before
 Not with advantage because I dont have
it but I was so excited
 Persuasion check  Im fishing for
drugs Im not going to lie Ive been on the road
a long time I dont remember how to do this
 I skip over to the door and gingerly
close it
 Yes I do And were leaving town
today
 I dont actually know what that is
 I thought it was very clever
 Ive got to be honest Im not made of
money but Im always curious for a new experience
 Well this might be complicated I think
that just What would
 A few experiences worth What would that
run me
 Im so sorry Im so sorry for dragging
the entire audience into this Hopefully your
children are already asleep I do apologize
 Thank you for really bringing that to
earth for me You started this
 All right Yeah put me in for one Ill
try anything once
 Whats it called Skein
 No this is not how this works This is
not how this works We bank our moments for those
moments when life is disappointing
 Oh my god
 This can come in handy in all sorts of
ways
 The fact that you had this ready means
that there is no shame here You were ready for this
 I know I can tell
 A big purple pierced demon walked into
the room and was like hello
 Somewhere around level eight this is
going to be hilarious Somewhere around level
eight somebodys going to go shopping and the rest
happening now
 Years in the making
 Shes fine shes just awful youre a
gentleman I hope to see you again Im looking
forward to this
 Of course we never met you you never
met us
 I am already out the door with a
flourish
 That is an extreme overexaggeration We
got a health potion
 It worked
 North to the horses
 I was going to say robbing shady people
is usually a bad idea
 No I dont think its the name of the
town
 What about Yogurt
 It usually is
 No weve got a cart
 I came though Alfield didnt I
 Thats right
 We have a horse
 We have a horse
 We have a wagon
 Why be fast What are we in a rush for
 I find careful is always best
 I dont get along with anybody
 You know where were headed
 It is such a different world
 Wow
 Mail fraud
 That is actually the worst crime weve
committed today
 Wagons ready Ive even attempted to hide
some of the contraband and otherwise I packed well
 Quite a few Got into a bar fight
 Bunch of assholes
 Significant improvement
 Yes Ill have a donut thank you
please
 I was just going there damn it
Bangarang
 What does not that old mean does it
mean theyre young
 Is it good and do we gain or lose hit
points
 Its change but travel is travel so
 Oh yes we traveled forever It was
constantly on the road Once we left home we
stayed moving
 Oh things Im not really much of a
performer Im more of Help set up Help run the
shows help make illusions that sort of thing
 I guess you could say a techie I show
off a little bit of the sword juggling
 Ive got some things I was working on
Like this
 Yeah
 Little roll
 Well its a curved sword So not the
curved ones But I could probably do a straight
sword Im not going to swallow a curved sword
That would be very complicated to pull off
 Im flexible but not that flexible Im
pretty flexible Yeah I never nailed anything
down for a really good act
 Not my incense
 Id like to see that
 I didnt know that
 I try
 Do they look like theyre unicorns
 
 Im fine with that
 Hmm
 Do these people look like theyre in the
mood to stop
 Whats insight
 Oh where do you see that Oh There it
is Thank you 
 Ill balance one of the swords on my
head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites
 They didnt poke the parents
 Ah its very good
 Yes
 It means that youre on a cart
 Can you get away with something like
that
 And stealing is wrong But if you did
it could you get away with it
 Careful those fingers are loaded
 Interesting
 I was going to say yeah Ill take a
round Im used to keeping an eye out on the road
 Ill sit with the cart for the first
roll
 That would be actually extremely
 Shes starting to believe
 Id say lets get a bit off the road if
possible
 Itll do
 Set a tent Start a fire
 They take an awful lot of time to put
up You do know this Theres a process
 Oh it would be amazing Ive done it
Its great but this is nice too
 We can chop it up
 A single tear pours down a porcelain
cheek
 Welcome to human
 Ill take it
 Turd watch
 Six
 I literally dont know Thats actually
the problem
 Travis its been nice playing with
you
 I thoroughly enjoyed your accent
 Everybody back
 Yeah you look it
 Was it a lot of water
 Im going to do something very weird
Im going to walk over and dampen my hand on the
water on his chest really quickly and 
 Huh
 You dont know that
 Only one way to find out
 Hes not wrong though It actually is a
pickle You can taste it
 Yeah its not bad
 Level three
 Where is the sword right now
 Thats a great trick
 
 This whole story Ive been watching
 Thats so disappointing All right
 Unless he runs away
 Hes fine
 I remember all of mine I dont know
 If youre going to vomit something salt
waters pretty decent It could have been way worse
 Oh its far superior Already youre
proving to be an asset
 You cant drink the salt water makes
you thirstier
 It feels like you should be able to but
you cant
 Does the horse have a name If it did
Ill make one up
 Try not to name them Were just going
to end up eating them
 His name was Winters Crest If he lived
that long that was when we were going to butcher
him and eat him You can rename him its fine
 That was the plan
 It means youre going to eat meat and
then youre going to make some jerky and then
youre going to buy another horse with the money
you make
 We celebrate everything
 Just glgg Lots and lots of glgg
 If youre on the road long enough you
eat a lot of animals You eat a lot of beasts of burden
 Ill keep
 Ugh I did until it bounced
 Five
 I might be distracted looking for things
that I can pluck out of the fields All right
 Most of us can see in the dark its not
a big deal
 Cant say that ah
 So you go to your HP
 Thats weird
 Lets head that direction and start
yelling at people
 Im going to stop one and ask what
happened
 What has happened
 Thats weird
 Is this making my spider sense tingle
can I track them
 Okay
 Okay all right
 I start one of my swords on the back of
my neck
Fjord
 
 Im preparing How close am I to this
thing
 Does it see us
 Im going to use Vicious Mockery at it
really quickly
 Im going to use Vicious Mockery Im
going to look at him with my eyes glowing and my
sword glowing and in Infernal say  The
light comes to blind your eyes and burn your
flesh Yeah d
 Yeah its a wisdom saving throw
 Yup so he takes three psychic damage
and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll
 Im going to use my bonus action yeah
fuck it lets go for it Im going to activate
both swords
 Should I Yeah
 He may have licked a couple of them
 Its a very pretty die
 Nine Oh nope never mind yeah
 Nine
 I want them to get a little closer
anyway Theyre all far
 Its going to go great
 Yeah this is what was coming
 Im going to take a run Am I going to
do this Am I going to be this idiot Yeah lets
be an idiot Im going to take a run to try to get
cover at the other house Im going to try to run
across the alleyway
 Yeah
 Dashydash
 Yeah
 Thats my round I just 
 Theres one on the roof still too
 You get bonus actions all the time
 Is this
 The damage may have
 Yeah I dont know what the crown is
 Concentrations gone
 You could even make it to get into his
face
 Im not used to melee combat This is so
terrifying
 I dont want to get up in that
 Im going to stab this thing that just
fell right in front of me Just going to stab it
 Question about Rite of the Dawn is it
just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it
also a
 Okay this is not an undead creature
 So its just an extra d Okay
just checking Thats how that works Okay cool
See if I hit Thank you 
 Oh my god
 I hit it with the other one
 Come on Oh thank God 
 So thats nine points of damage
 Yeah thats right I can break combat
with it It doesnt matter right At this point
Or does it get an attack of opportunity
 Theres no way I can circle up onto the
wall is there
 Yeah Get a little vantage on him
 I want to be able to hop on because I want to
head that direction afterwards All right
 And that way if he tries to run or do
anything I can futz with him
 This is becoming a thing
 Thats new dice man
 You made lemonade Way to make some
lemonade
 It will move slower if we kill them
 Man I hate level three
 This is fine
 I know Im being an asshole
 Man Im normally the one with shaky
hands
 We can take out people pushing it
 Does he have a spear I thought he had a
bow Oh hes got both
 No it does not hit
 Im taking a slice at this guy again I
dont have advantage anymore
 Slice number one Oh for fucks sake
Ten
 Slice number two That hits thank you

 Thats five points of damage and two
points of extra damage
 Im going to try and circle around it to
get out of the way of the archers Im going to
hop back off and get behind him
 I like the theory that he doesnt burst
into laughter he just holds the groan pain
 Two and Ive got one
 Im going to snap at him Im going to
use Blood Maledict
 Yeah no he aint
 That is my armor class
 Nope
 Oh come on
 Wait is it his turn already
 Because I was going to run that way too
I thought we were still
 Okay So I will
 I was going to run to see where the cart
was going Full dash
 No I wouldnt
 Is he triggering my spider sense at
all
 Okay
 I know but you know
 Thats why its like a bear
 This was just our little patch Our
gnoll patch
 Nows not the time
 He is so down
 You got to be fucking kidding me
really
 Oh Im down
 Thank you
 What were you thinking
 Thats literally the only thing thats
been happening
 Im going to put out these fires Oh
Im not getting up
 Im going to crawl back towards the
 That was weird
 There were
 What turns them like that Is there
something in the water
 Word came Word came that they were in
the south Where did word come from
 Petting zoo
 Well and were going to need some
lodging anyway so perhaps some trade could be
worked out
 Its literally glowing like a candle
right now
 I feel really bad for saying that out
loud
 Was there beer downstairs Was there
ale
 Im going to drop my things and run
downstairs
 Is there drink Is there smoke
 Ill take something interesting
 Fast or slow
 How much
 Nonsense
 Whats topshelf price
 I put a gold on the table
 Consider it an advance its been a
rough night for everybody
 And Im going to sip this mother
 That sounds nice Im going to sit and
sip this and grin and very silently have a mild
nervous breakdown about what just went down
 This is working out weirdly Im
excited
 We now need to have a Stephen Chow
night that was some crazy shit
 Its good for your back its really
true
 Pillow

 No everythings fine They just do what
they need to do I just have to keep them clean
 I have to take care of them or else
theyll stop working of course
 They do actually yeah Ive got to feed
them some well its complicated I dont like
to go too deep into it but Ive got to use my
bloodline on occasion Actually since were
already on the road I should be honest I wasnt
entirely telling the truth when I talked to you
that night
 Oh youre just a bundle of truth too
arent you
 I suppose its only fair I did tell you
that these swords are special and that they use
the blood of my family to activate themselves I
know I might have said I was from a long line of
priests and
 I didnt kill my whole family
 Our family were less the priests and
more the sacrifices We may have stolen the swords
and run Thats why Ive been trying to keep a bit
of a low profile when it comes to some of the authorities
 Its been a long time but Id rather
not run into them
 Oh I couldnt tell you It was my
parents I was just wee by the time that happened
 Oh I hope not I mean its been a long
time
 My parents never spoke of it Somewhere
out east
 Well it was a bit of a mess but I just
ended up there eventually Just looking for a
place where I could rest I suppose
 Well I dont know you that well
 That requires a drink
 Its a good place to be if you want to
run but not run
 Not that Ive ever met
 You know I dont know I never thought
to ask
 Apparently they needed us alive for it
so there was that
 So I was told
 Its not that bad though it doesnt
leave a mark really
 Oh yes of course It can come in handy
 Oh yes Of our bloodline apparently
 Well Ive cut a lot of people with them
Would you like to take a run at it You could be lucky
 I had a funny feeling
 Couldve been worth five copper on the
open road at one point
 Always could use a circus geek
 That is a question
 How do we get paid There was talk of
pay
 Ive got to say theres worse ways to
make a living
 Nott the gnoll killer
 I dont recall making that arrangement
 Youre so good at this
 Oh yeah More donut for us
 Its a very long barn
 He seemed nice last night
 Ill follow for this
 Ill go in for this if it means a faster
breakfast
 Wow thats an injoke
 I want to see if I see this I dont do
I
 Oh yeah I definitely dont see this
 The frittatas are going to taste real
weird
 Im going to walk over
 Need a hand
 We were part of this commotion last
night We were wondering if you need a hand with
anything right now
 Im taking off my jacket
 You going to rebuild give him a fine
plaque
 Or as another thought since you were
basically robbed who were they What happened
Has this happened before
 Were all going to die now
 You had a lot of meat didnt you
 Would you say that you offer a larger
selection of meat than some of the other
establishments in town
 I feel like Ive been robbed of the
experience of your fine fine meat products and
I for one would like you to rebuild so that I
might try some of your meats
 Im going to take a look Is the friend
whos dead skeletonized
 Oh burnt okay Where is this butcher
that you mentioned as well
 I think you were in the barbecue shack
 Its like half a question because
youre wondering why its called that at this point
 At least wide
 Thats an idea Dont pack up shop just
yet were going to see if we can do something
about these terrible creatures that have been
roaming around
 We are perhaps persons of action
 She really will
 It is a gesture like Prince
 When did we hire Tom Stoppard to write
this
 I couldnt deal
 I feel like that was worth pointing
out
 Tiefling thing
 Its new then
 It seems from what weve seen that
they were hungry
 I can understand that
 I always love a ruin
 Do I know anything about Yeenoghu
 A religion check 
 Thank you
 One last quick question though What do
the gnolls normally eat
 Those buffalo creatures that we see
roaming around
 Good to know
 Im filing Im putting a wall
between that
 Youre just made of secrets arent you
Just made of secrets
 Do you need more copper Are you all
right
 Okay because Ill give you two copper
if I get one of those pickles
 I pass him the two copper
 I know this may be a stretch but do you
have maybe any healing potions or anything like
that Or maybe this might be weird some kind
of poisons maybe
 For dealing with pests on a farm That
sort of thing
 Think that will work on a gnoll
 Stuff is stuff its bad for anybody I
guess
 What would that really If I were to
drink that right now what do you think that would
do to me
 Wow really
 Do you know about these sorts of
things
 Thats very impressive
 It was
 I ate mine It was quite good Now were
just sharing the juice at this point
 Juice is great
 I asked that
 Yeah I did ask that
 Wait the Crownsguard Really
 We should ask Bryce for some healing
potions
 Take the cart And get some meat from
the butcher
 Itll take a while to make the signage
alone
 Thats fair
 We could also see what they still have
at the butchers
 Or we could see what else they still
have at the butchers Theres a butcher
 Well we just heard that he might
 Extremely tactile
 Were going to go get a horse you dont
need to be here for that
 Let me tell you Reggie it would be the
best deal you could possibly make Im going to
use Charm Person
 Thank you
 Ignore her shes very difficult
 Youre a hero Thank you
 I hand him a silver also
 You said silver and were being fair
 If we come back it comes back
 Would my Hunters Bane be useful for
that For tracking these creatures
 Since they technically have some undead
around them
 Just a standard one Standard survival
check All right
 
 In theory am I actively tracking these
creatures The undead at least
 Im curious how much of this Hunters
Bane I can actually be using right now
 Hes sorry
 That was nausea
 Should we
 What does Blessing of the Trickster do
 I have advantage on smealth thats
great
 On smealth He who smealth it
 We wouldnt have to kill the horse we
could just send the horse
 Sure Recon
 Answered my question I was curious what
flanking was
 That helps
 
 Im quietish
 Im going to draw one of my swords and
just out of experiment try and get it to do that
weird thing it did yesterday With my hand
 Im going to stab the third one
 Ill take my run first Thats a wow
 My brain
 Thats seven points plus three radiant
 Am I close enough to hit the third one
thats still left with my second attack
 Good shot
 Im also going to point out they hadnt
been eating the hyenas anyway so maybe leaving
bodies of their pets is not the greatest idea
 That might be a smarter way to go
 Oh dear
 Im going to keep a hold of my sword
but Im going to wrap it in the coat so its not
glowing ridiculously
 Mmhmm
 With advantage
 Survival check
 Yours was handcrafted
 I miss being low enough level that we
just take everything we find no matter how useful
 Were going to be cracking open clay
pots
 Should I give it a little light or no
 That was so painful
 Theres limits
 No Oh wow
 Punch him in the balls
 I think we might have lost the element
of surprise
 I also uncover my sword at this point
which gives off a little bit of light
 Ive also got a distance attack Im
going to use Devils Tongue on the one that just
survived your hit
 Im going to use Vicious Mockery In
 It takes d psychic which is three
points of psychic damage and has disadvantage on
its next attack
 Put them in the jar
 We look at the rope connected to the
log
 I was helping
 Can I make a knowledge test to see if I
would know what this is
 Well is this intelligence or what
would this be Im trying to think I might have
come across this
 Just an intelligence check Im trying
to remember 
 We can put them aside We will be
bringing them out of here
  Human want a lantern
 I havent lit it yet You can light it
Ill help
 Im onehanded so I cant really help
you light it
 Anyone watching at home the physics was
really demanding on that one
 Well before we do that we should
remember to check for traps maybe
 I certainly cant
 No I cant I cant do any of that
 I wont be able to find them
 So true
 Were there any traps
 Hear hear
 Unless they knew that you would think
that
 Trap trap
 Do I still have advantage
 Thats okay
 Nine
 This is getting ridiculous
 We know they go down very quickly
 We can see now or try the other way
 The longer we wait the more things are
coming
 Be helpful
 Im going to creep out against the wall
closest to me and try and hide in one of these
coves Over in the corner as far as I can get
into the
 Since Im too far away for anything too
crazy I dont have a good bonus action I will
use my Devils Tongue Ill use Vicious Mockery on
the gnoll thats currently in between not the
one thats actually the one thats furthest from
us because hes going to be the archer and in
think of anything clever
 So yeah thats three psychic damage and
he has disadvantage on his next attack
 Natural 
 
 I was 
 God thats awful
 Im going to get a little Oh can I do
this No I cant do that Fuck I know Im so
sorry I should have my shit together How far
 Oh god thats too far to walk Im
going to try and get one little crevice Actually
Im going to hold my position Im so sorry
 Hold my position and use one more Tongue
on one of the other guys
 Oh so no
  and Im holding
 Does it hit the ball bearings
 Oh okay
 I like to think that your lollipop makes
Candy Crush sounds when it hits people
 You lost a gnoll there
 No youve got a gnoll You should have
that looked at
 Its so hardcore
 I support
 No advantage for engagement
 Im going to run up to these two and
join the fray up here
 First Im going to take a swing at the
big guy
 Thats  to hit
 And thats just using my normal one
for this one Thats eight points of damage
 Bonus action with the glowing sword goes
down into the hyena
 Thats an  to hit
 All right and thats eight points of
damage
 No this one was the glowing one
 Oh it was my main hand
 Oh okay I didnt know how that
 That would have been four
 I would have flipped them if Id known
 I was going to say I would have flipped
them if I had known
 I was going to hit the one that didnt
have much left
 Sure Ill do it reverse next time
 Blood Maledict on that fucker
 Yeah that dont hit
 Ill also say I think we oh no thats
right youre double
 I can see this is going to end up with
an Office parkour gif in your future
 You just slap him in the face
 He cant run anymore
 Thats so cool That spell is so cool
 Does Fjord get an attack of opportunity
on it
 That hits
 Im definitely going to take an attack
of opportunity on that one
 
 Is this main hand
 Eight points of damage
 At disadvantage
 Im going to run down the stairs the
opposite direction from the ball bearings Ill
see where I can get if I can get  feet
 Im going to also use Vicious Mockery
 DC on that it just says wisdom saving
 Where is my spell DC Well its weird
Im not a spell
 My charisma modifier is zero
 This is amazing
 No youll still get disadvantage
 Now youve got advantage
 Cheers
 I also like the idea of maybe giving the
healing potion to the healer
 Can you heal yourself without the
potion
 Oh well all right then That didnt
really occur to me
 Well they make a lot of noise They may
not have noticed
 Id also like to join in on that with a
religion check
 The cult of Yeenogru
 Mr Magoo Well you know Fake
confidence
 How are you feeling Fjord
 Im not convinced that they dont still
have people alive down there
 Lets make a pile of these bodies too
Just in case maybe they think that they took each
other apart
 On the way out
 I agree
 All right
 Yoplait
 Its hard to remember Its a lot of
aggression anger
 Do I remember anything about either
gender or that this would be Other than
I just saw a lot of aggression and a feral aspect of this
 Shall we go find out
 Filled with pickled ears
 Have you ever had pickled pigs feet
 Theyre in their own juices
 Oh theres no getting away from this


 I think I saw that Did you see that
 On the count of three
 Yay

 This is going to be the thing for the
entire campaign This is going to be the joke that
never goes away Nein
 No Dont joke dont ever
 Im going to run straight in take a
look around Is the undead one the closest one to
me
 Push me a little more against the wall
 Yeah over there Im going to hit that
undead one with Vicious Mockery Actually Im

 We lived
 Well theres one surefire way to make
sure that hes all right which is we get drunk
on something really expensive and listen to the
stories of all the people we just saved so you
can feel better about everything that just
happened
 And were going to spend a ridiculous amount
of the money we just made
 Yes you the small one in the back
 I like manacles
 Those are fancy

work
 Right All right heres the deal if

heads So be careful Im going to give in a
line one gold piece each to each of them in the row
 Now for this you promise that your
terrible bandit days are over because youre

 Well probably be staying at the Leaky
Tap
 Were trying to keep a low profile
 Perfect for me
 Definitely perfect for me Would you say
theres a reasonable bathhouse for someone whos
 and complicated in the horns
 Somewhere I can take a nice bath in
peace
 Dont want to scare the locals too
much
 Thatll do it
 I throw another gold at him You are a
fount of information
 You can be frank
 More of an antique collector
 Were looking forward to seeing you

 No
 Dont trust trusting people theyre
just the worst
 No I have full faith in untrustworthy
people
 Im going to find mulled wine Its
cold and I want to be warm
 Well watch the cart and were going to
take the cart to find some mulled wine
 So glad were not really outside were
only physically outside We get to be at the
table and its so nice
 Its like Poor Matts soul
  Im going to kill you
 A clutch of objects
 I can think of uses for that Im not
here goddamn it
 Did we find mulled wine Did we find a
wine vendor
 If there were any little confectionaries
with that too we would have bought whatever they
had left
 I got it
 We bought enough for everybody
 Theyre really bright and garish Really
good
 Its the stuff they serve at the German
Christmas markets Theres pastry and mulled wine everywhere
 A tab with a conversation of possible
rooms for rent later

is the show
 Is it a clean shuffle
 Nope I dont see shit
 Can I try to perceive this too
 
 That doesnt seem very nice
 Follow them outside and rob them
 Sorry
 We did get rooms
 Claudia Sheed
 Claudia Sheed
  Claudia Sheed
 Brilliant thank you
 I normally find shouting peoples names
really loudly tends to bring them to your table
 We could look Have we had food and
drink yet
 Im interested either way So Im going
to stand up and start heading upstairs
 Come Unpleasant One lets go
 Im going to look for what looks like an 
office For whatever door seems most inconvenient
 The one on the landing it is
pattern
 Friends from out of town
 Bryce sent us
 From Alfield
 We have come from very far to take a look
 Converse
 Well to wrap it up a bit weve just
recently got into town Were looking for
employment odd jobs We were recommended to you
to be the person to talk to about what actually is
going on in this city Were new to this city we
dont necessarily have our thumb on the pulse of
whats going on
 We just figured we would make sure that
you were aware we were here We dont want to
ruffle any feathers and we dont necessarily know
who are the right people the wrong people to work for
 Thats very fair
 Sounds easy except its really not
 Grace of the Platinum Dragon
 Speaking of tourist looks how much of a
problem would this be in general
 Excellent
 Is there a shrine to the Dragon as
well
 Ixnay on the angersstray
 Eh
 Were also always big fans of
underbellies especially if theres an underbelly
with a heart of gold
 Are there names that if we hear we
should trust
  Caleb
 Thats all right we just need your
cat
 Im tossing Frumpkin in the direction of
that
 In the basement
 I need to know what your cats
seeing Whats the cat seeing
 Oh for fucks sake
 Theyre making asses of themselves
arent they
 You gave us the basics though
 We were listening to the description of
this insanity
 Except that they told them their real
names And where theyre staying
 Groups of people are always idiots
Never trust a group of people I specifically used
to gather people into groups to make them into
idiots Its just what you do You dont
 That is exactly what I did Its how I
met you Its why I keep you around
 Yes but we werent a group of people
We all hated each other
 You just told them your real name
 Ive literally only met one other person
named Beau
 It was a different Beau
 Im eventually falling asleep but
before that Im going to go take a fucking bath
There is a bathhouse Im going there Anyone who
wants to come with me is welcome to do so
 Its just a walk
 Is it going to be open at night
 Im going to go and try and find out 
Im going to and try and find out
 Im just happy with my company
 Three
 
 Thats not on the way then
 You know Nott I notice I notice the
way that you eye things on occasion
 Not right now and thats fine And I
would hate to get in the way of any of your
business Your business is your business and Im
perfectly fine with that But its good to
remember that there are people who need what they
have There are people who need every bit of what
they have And there are people who would be much
happier if they had a little less
 Well thats a skill worth developing
Thats a skill very much worth developing
 If they seem grumpy or angry and seem
overly concerned with an enormous amount of money
that they happen to have or using it to just be
mean or cruel to somebody thats probably a sign
that theyd just be much happier if they just knew
exactly who liked them and the only way you could
ever really know if someone likes you is if you
dont have anything over them And the easiest way
to get to that honesty is if you dont have
anything
 Oh yes
 Unless theyre grumpy because they dont
have enough Because if youre hungry you get
very angry
 You get so angry when youre hungry
 Beau has way too much So you should
probably take some stuff from Beau Thats fair

Beau really needs to know who likes her
 Im so excited about a long rest
 Youre going to get us killed
 Youre making Tijuana bibles Youre
making Tijuana bibles for your religion Is there
going to be nudity and sex in these Because then
its basically a Tijuana bible Dont Google
Tijuana bible
 Oh I did it before you woke up
 Sure Happily
 That would be no problem
 Blacksmiths is filthy well go there
first
 Youre welcome to take a look at the job
postings if you dont want to take a bath but Id
highly recommend a bath Baths are great
 Yes Very fancy
 That entirely depends what you think
its worth
 Wow
 Im so excited
 Its not the first time Ive been
called actually no its not the first time
Ive been called that thats fair Its not
Molly this is me
 But not our gold
 Thank you
 Why would you want to be famous
 No I have no interest in becoming it
thank you very much
 I have most everything I need already
Why would I need more stuff
 No
 I prefer to keep it on the downlow
personally
 Im going to look right back at him
 Do I have something in my teeth
 Im here for making money
 This is what happens after you go to
meetings is suddenly you want to be about
something Be careful
 Im well aware This is entirely for the
sake of my mirror Im very well aware
 I propose a plan
 I have a plan for this I have a plan
were going to take our scrap and were going to
sell it so that we have some money Were going
to take the good feelings from that money and
were going to spend it on hot water and
inappropriate friendly nudity
 And were going to have a discussion
about what were doing with heat steam water
and a little bit of cash
 I just find its easier to have this
conversation when everyone is sitting around naked
in hot water
 I take five steps and then I go I dont
know where the blacksmith is
 Well if we got there then yeah
probably
 Works for me
 Why is it called Lodge of the Eclipse
 Is there is a taxidermist is what I
think shes asking
 Is the board between here and there The
job board
 We can do a couple to the Archive
couple to the Kings Hall Just pick it up
 Higher than ten
 I feel good about everything that just
happened
 Or the Platinum House
 Weve got Mr Memory Board here to scan
the thing
 Works for me
 I believe in you
 Stitches get eh snitches get
stitches Stitches are just
 Snitches get stitches wait
 One of the few
 Its time for a bath
 This is a dark mirror man A dark dark
mirror
 Ive learned one thing in my travels

always hit the bathhouse first Every major town
 Oh happily
 Early s River Phoenix hair going
everywhere of its own volition
 I walk out of the changing room and walk
by dont even just give a kiss on the head
Took you bloody long enough to find us
 Im for the record tattooed a lot
 Okay I apologize that theres no art
yet Ill get around to that Theres a snake
tattoo that curls all the way up the arm That
goes all the way up into the peacock people have
seen the top of the peacock but the peacock is
actually roving into a big floral piece that goes down
into a snake that is swallowing the hand There is
an eye in a pyramid piece with another eye
illuminated above it It seems to almost go into
the hairline all the way up the back Theres a
moon and sun connected to the shoulder piece that
all interconnects The whole things very complicated
 It is all upper body yeah
 Except for do you actually know what
that is
 Yeah no I dont
 Each tattoo has  meanings
 They paid us  gold for three days
 Ive never made money like this
 Word of mouth You dont need a big
public thing
 Three and one dead
 Its going to be very hard to search for
us if they dont know if its Nine or Nein
 Also if were going to get him back we
going to have to have an agreement about the fact
that while theres going to be a certain amount
of advertising necessary for this kind of venture
there are many of us and I think its fair to
say that want to keep things quiet As quiet as possible
 Bless you
 My father just threw me right in Thats
how I learned
 No thats a terrible idea
 It was awful but here we are
 Wow that brought it back
 I dont think they understood that was
an invitation
 Thats exciting
 One assumes theres a mist thats just
covering everything
 I mean nuditys going great and all
but this is more about comfortability
 Thank you
 I dont know what a wheelhouse is but I
feel pretty positive about the metaphor in general
 My god the money
 Ive never seen anything like it
 Three months worth of shows like
that
 And theyre so lazy
 I vouch for her for what its worth
 It means what it means
 You run into your friends who are also
heading in odd directions
 I tend to find its easier to look into
somebodys eyes and figure out if theyre lying to
you if theyre naked and boiling
 I like to think youre scratching
Youve got a sword in your hand for gods sake
 I say we take the beast Again keep it
on the downlow Well figure out a way of getting
credit and keeping our reputation but keeping it
quiet
 God I hope his name is Harold
 I felt demeaned but in a good way
 Yeah were up
 Then yours was in a locker
 Its a really hot hot tub
 Im ready for Monster Hunter
 Backflip
 Lets find a herald The maudlin
herald
 Come on Nott itll be fine Well see
if we can meet anybody else who you could make
feel better about who they are
 Esma
 Short for Barrymore
 Really oh wow thats a number
 Its a minus two
  gold pieces
 Just for the entrance they are aware
that there are several of us we are just
representatives of a slightly larger group
 Of course but we can all get entrance
from this writ
 You need all the names of everybody
involved
 Well were called the Mighty Nine
arent we
 Well lets just send seven of us down
for now
 Oh really Ive never felt such hatred
than this moment Wow god damn it
 We walk away
 Then theyre going to send people down
there
 But then theyll know
 As someone who actually has towns that
they cant reenter again for reasons that we
will go into later over booze its best to keep
a clear reputation
 We can just run back up
 Theres a blacksmith who knows
 I think the blacksmith will get ten gold
for telling them if they find out there was a
manticore down there that
 Its an emergency plan Its a good plan
B Ill grant you that
 Im going to juggle
 That was impressive
 If that isnt a beerworthy story I
dont know what is
 The Master from Doctor Who
 This is the smartest feat youve ever
taken
 We got to kill that guard
 Wet bar
 Boom
 Were clean were relaxed were ready
to go into a sewer
 I do too
 Its time to eat some roast beast
 Lets carb up
 Hm
 Why would you get a room at The Pillow
Trove
 Oh thats very clever actually Well
done Are you still expecting your package
 Sometimes I expect things to show up and
then they dont It can be very disappointing but
its all right Im sure itll show up
 Not that it matters if it doesnt
 I didnt expect you to say that
 Thats very true
 I was just waiting for the drop to look
at the shoes and you look back and yep no those
shoes dont get in here
 When I was young we would stack three
up and put on a coat
 Incognito
 I dont normally speak with the dead on
a first date but well think about it
 That is fair you are shabby
 Does feel like a terrible abuse of
hospitality
 Is the Traveler the only god youve ever
seen or have you seen other gods out of curiosity
 So this is the one that decided to make
itself presentable to you
 Ive been drinking
 Were having the room party after the
sewers
 I want to defile a very expensive
shower
 And somebody elses hotel room will get
us clean
 Let a man be eccentric
 Im a real fan of this one
 Im tossing a silver over just for
that
 Yeah
 Dont tell me how to spend my money
 What youre hearing is the happiness of
a performer
 Fuck you Birdman

 I know one thing thats a photosensitive
thing If we need to make a fast escape Id rather
have some light maybe if its something like
that
 Daytimes better for that Different
environment
 I dont know
 I say we do it
 Im buzzed and if I have another drink
Im going to be more than buzzed
 Im right where I want to be I want a
minute walk to get there
 We have a light spell though dont
we
 I must have a torch or something
 I have a tinder box
 I have a hooded lantern
 I have all this stuff in this bag I
never opened
 Youve got a handaxe
 Have you equipped it
 Yeah look at that Oh wow
 A poor man could buy half a cloak Half
a cloak between them
 I love it
 Coming down
 Up up down down left right left
right
 South
 Always down
 Thats fair
 This is your fault
 How would you know that
 Ill be with you
 Im activating one Im pulling a hand
down one of my swords and Im getting it to light up
 Oh my god
 Six
 Six
 
 Dont you have a Actually youve got
an unarmed strike
 So that means you can do four points of
damage Technically its not one point its four
points
 No it doesnt help
 I see the mess this is making and Im
going to turn around and Im holding the sword
but Im going to punch with the hilt of my sword
 No the one that attacked Yasha
 Plus my strength my nonexistent
strength modifier
Thats a  to hit
 Thats one damage
 I can take a bonus attack though and
Im going to hit it again
 
 Well Im using my other hand since
technically I have two attacks its not two
 Its another point of damage
 Way to date yourself right there
 You worked to make it so nice
 I did
 Seriously Caleb how are you
 If we hit you really hard would you
still be standing up right now
 Thats a good question I hadnt really
thought about that
 Rat spiders Ooh
 At first I thought it was some sort of
evil gassy dog
 Are they undead rats
 With advantage
 All right Wheres my intelligence
there we are Thats a no thats a nine
 Mostly undead
 Lets be sneaky
 Yes
 
 I think we should try to cut it down in
case its a person
 Or a rat
 Im going to try to very gently maybe
with everyones permission Im going to gently
start cutting into the bottom of it not too
deeply
 Im sorry do you have a plan
 Well all right then I keep moving
downward
 Yes
 It was the radiant rite
 Or they havent been eaten yet
 Ill work with that
 Lets try and not set fire to the human
shaped things
 Poke and wiggle Then a flame
 Well it knows that theyre alive
 So Im sure they wiggle every now and
then anyway
 They look pretty dead dont they
 Thatll do
 Yep Little bit of magic on both sides
little bit of tank
 Hes not using it
 Im going to very gently cut her handaxe
out with my radiant sword
 Dont eat it
 All of the ones webbed to the walls are
just as emaciated and dead
 Six
 Im going to start trying to cut down
find the points of the web wall where its being
held together and cut any of the web
 Id forgotten
 To be fair invisible spiders are the
best spiders because you cant hey look at that
 Im 
 We have a couple around
 We should probably clump together
 Thats a lot of dice
 You can go first
 Im going to head towards the spider as
close as I can get Theres not a lot I can do
 Im going to use Devils Tongue Im
going to use Vicious Mockery
 
 It was gifted
 We are golden gods
 I have made a terrible mistake
 Im just going to hold
 An attack for the second that its
within range
 It might auto if you select your
 It really ties the sewer together

 Or do damage
 Hes a liar Hes a lying liar
 Fair
 Blood Maledict I see it look at her and
I immediately full Blood Maledict Im going to do
the fucked up one and Im going to take four
points of damage for it There you go I have that
moment I look at it and my neck bursts and I
bleed out the vein
 Bamfed
 Lets form up stick close
 Dont get so far that we cant get to
you if it hits you
 Im sticking with everybody and let me
take one where am I Let me take like a step
back and hold my action there
 Mmhmm
 Its called Princes of the Universe
 Slightly warm Toasted
 Im going to at least run up to the
other side of Jester just to keep us clumped a
little bit What I can do is I can do Vicious
Mockery again Im going to cast Vicious Mockery
and  Ill cut off your legs Give
it a shot Make a roll against wisdom
  Who ate all the
Cracklin Oat Bran
 Save versus wisdom
 Wisdom modifier is three
 I mock him and thats three points of
psychic damage and he has really Does it not
even matter Then he has disadvantage on the next
attack
 Something about my words are just making
his blood boil
  I whisper and then I
fire
 I never had it do that before
 You see what I mean These people are
fun
 Im going to go poke it with a sword
 Im going to start binding it up for
travel
 Its very dark still also
 
 No I hear the commotion and come
halfway over and nothing seems theyre burning
spiders
 You are checking the bodies for things
right
 Well thats fine then
 We see him collecting everything
anyway
 We know youre going to lie about it
 She was a good person
 I heard Gentleman Im walking over
 Whos the Gentleman
 Oh
 Of course friend weve never seen you
before in our entire life
 Does anything about his tattoo irritate
me
 You know what I mean
 All right
 Thats fair
 And some coin
 Why dont we get into some daylight and
take a look
 We do have a spider body to pick
  Continuity Roll for
continuity
 Maybe they buried something here
 Im walking over with this too
 Im waiting for them to break up and I
suppose were packing the spider up to bring topside
 Well give it a push
 I hang back for a second and I very
quickly gently socially pin Caleb to the wall
Face to face as awkwardly close as I can get
 No youre not Hey Caleb Im fine if
you skim something off the top thats fair but
be clever about it Just distribute  or 
percent of what you find okay Good boy Give him
a little slap on the face and then I go up
 Party time
 These papers Oh thats a spider
 Theres also an egg sac that got taken
care of
 You dont look like an administrator I
mean thats actually almost a compliment
 Extra pay would soften the blow
 Travis will never see that card
 Yes its like working bitch face
 Look at that Thats brilliant
 I dont know about you Ive got goals
 Im working towards something
 Something
 Buy me a drink and Ill tell you
 Dinner and bad decisions and
cleanliness would be great
 Thats why people have bathhouses to
clean up
 Or would I still be in the room
 Lets call that a 
 Whatcha doing
 What were you looking for
 Were you looking for this I hold up a
folded piece of paper
 What will you give me for it
 No something I dont want money I
want something give me something
 Not gold pieces What do you have
 Thatll do

 Its a blank piece of paper
 I hand back the acid Dont try and go
through his stuff youre just going to get caught
 What did we talk about grumpy people
 Maybe if he spends more time around Beau
hell get grumpier
 Thats a fair point I stand up Dont
go through my things I know everything I have
And I walk out the door And I walk by him Shes
going through your stuff by the way
 Ive already walked away
 I am downstairs having a drink

 Well he forgot that he put it there You
think youd still feel that
 No no no
 Well done Oh that was terrible
 Exactly what she said
 Well its inevitable if you kick a cat
youre going to end badly Thats just how it
works
 Oh sure if theyre already dead just
go for it
 Is this a thing that really happens
 But she paid for the whole night with
all of us
 I try to look him right in the eye when
I say that
 Roll for random bar
 No work lets go make an ass of
ourselves at the Evening Nip
 Scout it out I think thats a great
idea
 Just because someone has tattoos doesnt
mean they know everyone who has a tattoo These
are very different tattoos
 We learned something today
 Six more hours Lets make it so they
have to break this into like five YouTube videos
 I feel like we all grew as people
 Charlie farting in the corner
 You are not
 Bit of a pain in the ass
 Sleep yes
 Too good
 A total stranger would also be very
useful
 Someone short
 Right there patrician Thats perfectly
fair right there
 Yes See One problem already solved
 Thats too many new options
 This is going to pay off at some point
in the future
 Yes
 Did Yasha take off
 Well yeah she sleeps
 Yeah she does that
 Shes good Shes just got some personal
issues thats shes going through
 It takes time
 I assure you shes worth it Shell be
back in her own time
 Are you sure
 Yeah no please lets not start
calling names
 Thaumaturgy to close the windows
maybe
 This is terrifying but I think the
three most evenkeel normal of us should go to
the meeting I dont think that the three of us
necessarily would be appropriate company
 This works for me
 I dont know Theres so many options
 Are there any candy stores There are
stores that specifically sell candy
 We could be

 Never mind you have a meeting to go to
The rest of us are going to have some fun
 Thats assuming the money shows up in
time
 I have not actually seen this Pumat so
I would love to actually take a look
 Or with us were going to go shopping
 Oh hello Molly hello
 Pleasure charmed
 If its all right Im going to peruse a
bit
 Extremely accommodating
 All of them
 What are you going to put in it
 Yes please clean it Please
 It was starting to it has a brine
 Ive been doing a perusal by the way Is
there anything thats caught my eye in this
 Make an investigation check Its hard
to concentrate 
 Sure
 Interesting
 All right thats interesting
 The final piece that I noticed
 Wow
 We all do
 Thats a great plan
 What did we each make off of
 Okay so I did So I can technically
afford this
 Id love to see that heart locket if you
dont mind This thing
 Pleasure to meet you I was looking at
this piece right here
 They tend to sort of heal themselves
though
 This is quite nice oh yeah You know what I
think Im going to treat myself Im going to take
it I feel like Ive earned something weve had a
good run of it and I have never spent this much
money on anything in my life
 I pass  gold
 Just Molly to my friends
 This is wonderful Im going to add it
to my other necklace
 I feel its right to my heart Right
there
 Yeah Ive been looking in the little
mirror trying to get the height right
 Can I
 Oh thats right Fine This is good
Okay
 Well be back
 It went back to a 
 To be fair they make pornographic cakes
there so its all right
 Heaving
 Good skirt around there by the way
Well done
 We were all in high school once its okay
 I thought were going to go for Mighty
Nein sponsorship at the Nook
 I didnt think to ask Honestly
 Not that I remember
 Oh god no not my stuff Thatd be
ridiculous My stuffs worthless
 Well you know Some people have needs
It happens Just keep an eye on your things and
make sure you always know how much money is in
your purse
 That was a sniper shot
 Thats a very good idea
 We can be very distracting
 How were his shoes
 Like nice loafers
 Insight check watching this
 
 What are no never mind
 Well thatll work then
 Ah yes
 Table one
 Wow
 Allow me to collect my additional
notes
 Shouldve picked up a copy
I was trying to go before you jump into the ring with
Muhammad Ali type of thing but Muhammad Ali isnt here
 You come from being touched by some kind
of primordial chaos magic something powerful
strange creative and bizarre Youve recently
had everything turned upside down
 And have started a new path The path
you are walking is not the one you were expecting
Its not the one youre going to find Its true
You are walking towards some destiny
 Just not the one youre expecting
 I only did three cards
 Thank you
 To be fair you would tell a random
person they have a booger on their nose
 That is a very good question I second
that question
 Ive never done anything for free in my
entire life
 Getting in would be a little tricky
youd have to get by the guards
 I can work with this plan
 Oh you want to set some sort of trap or
example for her
 Sure
 This seems a little unfair
Sure
 Do we want to put down some ball
bearings Ive got a big bag of them
 Thatll do
 
 Right
 Nott dear Why dont you tell the nice
man the truth Devils Tongue
 Probably should just tell him what you
were really looking for
 What for Its fine no ones in
trouble
 I mean we can help save you thats
what friends do Any of us who get more powerful
can help you
 I think we can all do that
 Were all friends
 Its not going to last you do know
that Its not going to last
 Well enjoy it while you have it
 Were going to try and keep both of you
alive
 Remember Nott that next time you try
and do this and if that letter goes missing again
I can do this to you again I give her just enough
of a knock on the head to break the spell
 That was very interesting
 Oh I dont know People are strange
Anyone who looks like us you collect a few
interesting enemies on the way even at her age
 Of course Every night
 Sure
 Nott is just upset because she was
trying to do a little reading last night as well
 I didnt understand any of that
 I honestly dont understand any of
this
 What accent was that
 Especially since it just rained so the
sewer will be really damp
 Do we still have the writ or is the
writ gone
 Never mind thats fine
 Oh I can figure it out
 Oh
 Thats not going to go poorly
 
 Ten
 Im going to put the hood up and stay in
the back
 I think I am a very reasonable personal
assistant to anyone who is trying to make a deal
 Do we have to have names
 Well fine Erikson
 Do you need a drink
 While were bowing on our way out Im
going to drop my waterskin and spill it
 Oh Im so sorry my lord
 As Im cleaning it up Im going to make
eye contact just briefly What do I see
I was curious what the reaction to this ridiculous
creature is spilling shit all over her front lawn
Thats all
 Yeah
 A thousand apologies my lord Ill take
your sister and make sure she gets her medicine
 Theres easy ways to find out if people
are terrible or not
 Must be some sort of harvest theme that
everything is going up
 Im perfectly content making snap
judgements of people Ive been doing it all my
life and its very rarely steered me wrong and in
another time and another place Id be more than
happy to run something
 There is going to have to be some coin
of course
 
 Its just after noon
 This place is giving me a rash
 Im going to sit at another table and
listen in
 Really oh fine
 Im giving a clear
 During the gala
 Party after
 Did you procure this for us
 Thats impressive
 Wow
 I can probably get one of them the way I
did with Nott last night if you like Make sure
were not walking into anything we dont want to
be
 No I do not but
 Thats fine
 And if hes not then they dont have to
pay because we obviously failed
 Its a good pay day
 I respect this squarely but if you
really feel like this is turning then well turn
 Were in
 Has anyone been watching us
 Thats an eight
 I got a nifty necklace
 It does cool things on DD when I put
it on my character it did really cool things It
got a little picture
 On DD Beyond Thats nice
 Previously known as the Knights of
Requital
 We have Book Boy too he could probably
tell if theyre the same or not with his
 With his brain
 Yes Well the eyes in it yes
 We had them would we have noticed if
they were handsigned or if theyd been printed
 These are the most intense public
officials Ive ever attempted to swindle so Im
not entirely sure what we do at this level
 Leave a mark on a tree etcetera if you
agree to these terms and then we leave a mark on
a tree similar sort of thing
 A bag of gold in a trash receptacle
 Im saying that theres nothing to
commit proof other than money actually exchanging
hands We used money for these things all the time
back in my day So if that letter asks for some
sort of assurance or some sort of money to be
leave some money in this location for them and
if they find that money then they know they
actually consented and agreed to this whole
argument
 It isnt that complicated
 I dont know if Richters have fans
 Im baffled by the notion of building a
box inside of a larger box inside of a larger box
to hold papers but fine
 Lets start by talking to our friends
before we start investigating our allies
 I keep trying to make a sound its just
nothings working
 Beyond actual personal stationery I
think the notion would be is that you would
actually send your actual handwriting in something
like this because that way they would know that it
was you You would be very careful how and who you
would send that through You wouldnt want a
second person taking dictation as you plotted to
overthrow the government
 Its good theres a bathroom on the way
to that That works out well
 Maybe a birthday card
 I thought we were going to take the
sewer to get in there
 Perhaps we should just have a two person
reconnaissance for now
 Too soon
 Could you parkour the wall
 I knew you were already there
 I got ball bearings man

 Call me pinball wizard
 Yeah that changes things the
landscape
 A plank of wood will work too
 We have rope
 I have pitons and a hammer and rope
 To a point
 Its standard carny practice to be able
to fake boils and stuff with a disguise kit to
leper up a bit
 Sure
 Could fake some sick on people
 You can just drag me in
 I can make a scene
 Have we talked about the other house
yet Because the distraction was obvious
 Was it a guard dog
 They havent gotten back yet Nevermind
all right Im jumping ahead
 Were in
 Were going to need a bigger boat
 About an hour
 And who said I was going to do my face
 We dont want them to look at it too
closely
 Oh Im going to do that too Ive got
a plan
 Youre not going to touch my clothing
 No were not setting fire to my
clothing Im going to mess up my junk what fierce
 No back at the do we have a place
where I can work or am I going back to the Leaky
Tap Or is that too far away
 An hour painting my dick No Im going
to need some privacy for that

 Im also going to need to order some
breakfast food Something eggy
 Really
 I thought you wanted a distraction
 A Dennys whatever The worst pub
ever
 No Im going to scramble everything
Im going to get some beer Im going to get some
mayo Im going to get a little bit of everything
Im going to put it in my
 A little bit of hot sauce
 No problem Were going to put it in
my Ive got a little water sack Im going to
mix it all up and put it in there and wait till
were ready to go
 D proficiency bonus intelligence
modifier
 Thats 
 I have no intelligence bonus
 You can see
 Thats the brilliance is no ones going
to look that closely
 Literally forever
 Shit I didnt even think about that
God damn it
 Im always ready to make a damn fool of
myself
 No Im fine Im perfectly perfectly
fine I dont need to do any of this
 Im fine
 No I dont  I was born in a place
like this I dont want anything to  Im going
to give myself a little  Sir theres 
 Im going to go for it right in his face
 Magnets how the fuck do they work
Thats nice 
 Im going to start crawling along the
floor and im going to cut myself a little bit on
my neck Since Im used to it I dont mind a
little blood Im giving myself a good cut maybe
therell be a little ice fleck I dont know if I
want to activate that if itll work on my
fingernails but what the fuck Im going to start
crawling leaving a trail of vomit into the next
room going no No
 Yup
 Off in the distance you hear You have
no legal authority over me 
 Im just running the hall
 Im crawling in the hall
  Im still bleeding from the
neck
 Im going to immediately  Im going to
go limp
 Then the minute the doors open Im
going to make a break for it
 Im out
 Im going to bolt Full speed
 All right Athletics or acrobatics
Athletics
 Oh yay Thats nice Nine
 Its magic Im possessed I turn to one
and go  The power of Christ
compels you Im going to use Devils Tongue and
Im going to do a couple points of damage to him
 Vicious Mockery
 Its only a couple points
 On Vicious Mockery Wheres my  Im
not used to magic Its so weird
 Charisma modifier is zero
 Is it Im blind Where does it go
 It wouldve been a plus three modifier
sorry
 Im trying to find that Im not used to
magic
 Yeah never mind
 All right
 I know Is there a window
 In the door
  Are there bars on the
window
 All right Im going to peek out the
door to see if anybodys coming for a minute
 I mean the little door window
 No window in the door and the door is
locked Okay Im going to start gently meditating
on breaking the window or opening the window if
itll open
 How long has it been
 Im seeing how is it possible to open
the window
 God all these numbers I used to be good
at but Im not good at anymore Ten
 Thats fine
 Nope One
 Im going to jump out of it
 Yeah thats okay
 Carry me Im going to jump into your
arms while you do that
 Wait no Im trying to understand the
scene here I thought they were looking at him
 Well if Im already because I didnt
know if I was just standing
 I was already towards
 I know Im going to save that for
later
 That is in fact hot sauce Im going
to empty out my canteen into the fire
 I was making a distraction
 Fools seldom differ
 I jumped through a window
 Full glass it was great
 Well some of those are sequins but
yes essentially
 Its not about the plan its about the
desire to improvise
 Oh yay I had very little so thank you
for that
 It was probably just an attempt to steal
medicinals
 Finalized the plans
 We can just promise them money
 I thought that tied the whole thing
together
 What kind of dog
 Theres a guard dog
 It was a mastiff Was it a wellkept dog
or was it a dog of pride or just a dog of
 Does it look like the sort of dog that
you can actually be proud of or is it just a utility
 We have a cat
 Then someone would have to get the dog
back
 Im just talking about getting the dog
no
 Somebodys going to have to retrieve the
dog if the dog goes running
 This is the subtle one
 Im not showing anybody theres no
more of that What if the dog runs The guard will
have to get the dog back
 It was a great plan
 I was thinking some carnival masks from
the other direction
 Everyones going to be pretty
fancydressed
 Masks on sticks
 If someone stops you if you have a
mask they know why youre there
 I was really expecting more there
 Be the chaos you want to see in the
world
 Thank you
 Looking for Melrose 
 I was about to say I dont need much
 Ill pay that
 Yeah I will get reimbursed at the end
 Its for the best because now theres
no paper trail just in case they are trying to
 Now Im really worried about it
actually
 And I can be in the back and be drunk
and lookout
 Thats a very good plan
 
 Were so good at this
 Were going to sit in the sewer like so
much clown
 Candythemed too
 Mysterious whispers
 I dont think thats true
 The blue works Stick with it you
know
 All right Advantage Thats awesome
 
 I am
 What were those guards names
 If we hear the dog bark we can walk
by
 If you also hear me make the same sound
again that means trouble
 If you hear me make noise
 Oh we had ring of truth cast You cant
lie
 I did Solid
 Shes got the other end
 Sometimes theres balconies
 French roof
 I heard a dog barking I feel that this
plan was no better than ours
 Were keeping an eye on the street
 I think were on a corner like far
enough away from the house not to be a problem
 
 You look like a guard
 I got my cards out
 
 Hello pick a card
 
 No
 We had it coming
 
 Rugs are the new doors
 Thats a number
 That seems fair
 Natural 
 This is hard being outside
 Its okay Someone had to do it
 So I know that we can see if theyre
coming through
 We may need to distract Im going to

Go fuck with the dog I push the cat away with
that And do you want to go out
 Do you want we distract Crownsguard
 Can I assist
 I was about to yeah I know yeah
 All right
 Hows your evening going gentlemen
 Want a free tarot reading Im on a
fiveminute break for the entertainment

There you are dear Good god There were
those hooligans that were roughing us up earlier
Are you all right

 Hey Im only a little drunk
 Thats fair
 Yeah
 Thats fair
 Youre a gofficer and a nentleman Thank
you very much
 You had time to think about that
 Wait yeah
 We can disguise you
 Well no the charm wont work
 I was thinking about pushing straight
through the front door again
 Ive got a coat and a mask
 Masked
 Mmhmm
 Thats nice
 Its in your short rest button
 Short rest is down at the bottom
 Is this a thing that really happened
 Slightly ahead of the house so I can
see if people are going to be approaching the
house I put my jacket down and set up a little
busking A mild busk
 Oh no Im on break One on the house
 Im going to very slowly put my stuff
together and fold it all up
 Move around yeah but as long as I have
an eye on the main thoroughfare
 Nope
 Seven
 Seven
 You know what kind of fold she uses in
her undersheet Its like that
 As Im walking away from the house I
start singing loudly drunkenly  I saw
the moon in old in the darkness
 Im going to sing loudly as Im slowly
drunkenly making my way
 Hold Person
 Yeah Were going to start flanking to
the back
 Natural 
 Im going to take cover
 Weve got to get out of here
 Weve got to get out of here
 
 This was something entirely different
 What happened
 No
 You would be doing better if you
edubated every night
 That was a clusterfuck That was
amazing Youre all terrible people
 I cannot wait for this shit I am in
this shit Finally Im so excited
 Goddamn it
 
 Im going to head up to the other side
of the void Yeah Im going to sit there Im
going to start one of the blades up and Im going
to hold my attack for anything that crosses my path
 Actually Ill say the minute I see
something its Vicious Mockery
 But we cant see him
 Have I heard any of this happening
or
 Oh for gods sakes I am going to run
straight through the
 No Im going to stay at the edge of
this and Im going to use Vicious Mockery
  Stop where you are
 Yes
 That passes yeah
 Blood Maledict With the added
 Disadvantage on that
 He still has disadvantage
 Yeah I did
 No that was good
 If I run up behind it do I then get
advantage because hes flanked
 Im going to do that
 Its all nonlethal once you stabilize it
after you put it down to the ground All right
first strike with the
 No I know Im paying attention First
strike with the scimitar is a natural 
 Does that do a thing then For him or is
it just double damage
 Okay nothing weird in that
 Yeah no I miss things I dont get
special damage to him do I
 So I dont have enough movement to go
for another
 Run in and if I can flank him great If
not Im still going to take my shot
 All right
 Thats  to hit
  Oh god I dont get the d on that
so thats five points of damage
 Im going to bounce off the wall after
the other one hit and spinning around and finally
taking him and knocking him out with the little
spike on the side of the sword Right in the helmet
 Someone go deal with Beau
 Im pulling the armor off
 Did I feel anything when I hit it
 Did it set off the blood hunter spider
sense at all
 All right Just curious
 I got  feet of hempen rope
 With Beaus
 I was going to say with Beaus rope
because shes also got the hook
 Theres no bows
 Im going to put  platinum
  gold  platinum
 We cant stay here Weve got to move
 Everybody whos looking for him
 Thank you
 We can start heading back in our
direction at the very least Get further away from
 I dont know it seems kind of small
doesnt it
 Who are these people who caught this
person would be another question they might ask
We got to be careful
 No one is a hero for very long
 That was a metaphor
 Do we need a little greasing
 There it is
 You just rolled over it
 Oh for gods sakes You cant reason
with angry people
 Should I expedite this
 Come on friend We just need to ask you
a few questions and well let you be on your way
as long as theres nothing too inappropriate
happening Devils Tongue
 Wisdom save second level
 Are you trying to weasel out of my
 Or advantage
 So you get one more roll
 Its a wisdom save so its ten plus my
wisdom modifier
 So thats 
 Were not with the empire Were private
individuals just trying to get by We wandered
into a lot of chaos so we just want to know what
were getting wrapped up in right now
 Whats the Beacon
 Its right there Is it important
 Why Im just trying to understand
friend Help me help you
 What is the beacon for
 The rebirth of what
 This all sounds very complicated to me
I am personally of the opinion that we just let
everything go
 My friends are your friends
 Youre making a very very good
argument and my friends are your friends Were
all here to help
 Sorry to tell you but I think your
friend may have got hit on the end of something
fierce and may not have made it I thought I saw
someone fly by and take him out Im sorry
 Were trying to fight corruption in this
city in our own way We just need to know who we
can trust and who we cant
 I know my vote but anybody else
 Eh not our problem
 Thats fair
 Charm spells are mean
 Like an hour
 I can do two people
 Thats rude Im going to start moving
towards untying him unless anyones got any
 If were all good
 Insight check Do I get advantage
because hes friends with me
 Thats not bad 
 Personally this seems like more than I
feel like taking on right now I say we walk away
and youll know that our silence means that we
were trustworthy in the first place
 Have you ever pawned anything before
 Now were getting silly
 Hes not going to leave without the
beacon
 Did he get worried when we said we were
going to take a look at it one more time
 Agreed
 No
 You first
 I walk over and scrape my radiant sword
against the orb
 Just seeing Just going to give it a
little tap Im not cutting it Im just tapping it
 Does the radiant energy have any effect
on it
 Whats your name again friend
 Help us out here Im Molly and I
Give my friends more to go with Give them
something some reason to trust you to make sure
that this is not going to come back and bite us in
the ass I mean thats what were looking for
here is a reason for us to be able to walk away
 Should send him to a monastery
 How did you lose the thing in the first
place that you need to get it back
 By who
 I dont have any wizards Well I have
one wizard but
 Well to be fair they are kind of
arseholes
 How did they take it
 Did they come to you
 Sent by whom
 Your empress Which empress would this
be
 I dont know anything Its part of my
charm
 I say we give him his armor and that
thing and be on our way This is none of our concern
 That could be funny too
 Well were not going to give it to you
Were just going to leave it here I think thats
fair we didnt give him anything We found him
he attacked us we defeated him we walked about
our way
 We dont know what hes going to do
 Im all right with this
 Anyone else
 Unless youve got a strong opinion
otherwise Caleb on that thing
 Unless youve got a strong opinion on
that thing otherwise
 You dont have to stare at it some more
If its beyond you then its beyond me
 I say we just let it go
 Okay were getting into singing No
Im calling it then
 Just give him his bits
 Give him just the armor
 Well leave it right next to the bit
 There are good opportunities and bad
opportunities and this one is giving me the
vibration that perhaps we should just leave him
be
 Well hes going to be a little
irritated at me in about half an hour Im going
to start fraying the rope just a bit so that
itll be breakable with a little bit of work Are
we off
 Mmhmm Just give it a little
 I wasnt going to break it I was just
going to fray it
 We were literally just doing that And
boy Ive got to tell you that you are really
overestimating their fondness for me right now
  Your stuffs over there
 Im going to say right now that was
the easiest  platinum Ive ever made in my
entire life
 Thats fair
 I think he probably has some thing
Whatever they do
 Why are you so keen on this one I mean
that was a lot I dont want to get involved in
that Thats crazy
 Lets roll
 Do we want to end this really quickly
 We could go over and get involved in
that since you seemed so keen
 Oh now you dont want to
 But it wasnt
 He also technically memorized it
 Bad at this
 Shh

 Or you can take the lowest No
 Okay
 No
 Im standing with Fjord in shock and
horror
 I swear we just had this conversation
What changed
 You can turn into an alley
 Walking at a very gentle pace in that
direction
 Stay in school
 So sorry Im so sorry
 Oh goddamn it
 Ive know you too long now I feel
sick
 What a perfect stay in school moment
 I have a hooded lantern we can put it in
in the meantime
 Tinkerbell
 I like this plan
 Were going to see if we can find like
a
 Would they sell a lead box at a magic
shop
 We need a safe is what we need
 Lets hide it with the skeleton for now
Well put some of your thread on it
 And that way itll be down there
unconnected to us just in case someone finds it
and if they do well know the minute they touch
it
 For now
 Teamwork Fine lets do this
 Before we go in were going to go to
the basement
 I say we put it behind the skeleton
 Do I get anything from it Is it a
normal human skeleton
 Ten
 An alarm and a lock
 I like this plan Its a good plan
 I think were going to need you upstairs
for some identification I think it would be less
suspicious sleeping down here
 So noted
 And if someone spies on it I dont want
them to see you with it
 You can spy on anything I imagine I
mean its magic right
 Is that really going to work
 Itll take  seconds to get here from
the second that alarm goes off
 One night
 Well
 Can I help with this
 Yeah I can Is this survival Seven
 Lets put it behind the skeleton If I
came down here Id look in the crates Its the
first thing Id do
 I look in the crate
 Awesome
 Nope Never mind Damn That was good
thought though
 Thread Lock
 One of you if not both of you
 So were going to go in and out of this
room several times tonight
 That in no way is suspicious but thats
fine
 I have had this roommate
 Whoa
 There should be an annoyance check This
is so great
 Theres money and loot Lets take a
look
 Were going to want to take a look at
these boots These daggers
 Lets not be hasty
 Well were not going to speak of that
in mixed company but theyre dealing with other problems
 Lets divvy up the loot Ive worked it
out thats  platinum apiece and two gold
pieces apiece
 With two platinum left over
 Mmhmm
 Mmhmm
 Mmhmm
 Yeah all right How do they look
 I think they clash a bit but
 No not really
 Theyre caffeinated Sorry
 Oh theyre very comfortable and they
keep everything else clean
 Im playing with the longsword
 Im going to parry
 Boy that hits
 Ow
 I hit her with the flat of the blade
 Any effect
 Any effect
 My god it works Its amazing
 Youre a remarkable judge of character
you know that
 I think what Beau is trying to imply
is Im going to use something a little more
basic Do you know the story of the scorpion and
the turtle
 And then what happens
 The scorpion rides on the turtles back
across a river The scorpion stings the turtle
they both drown What is the moral of this story
 Thats true but the full point of this
and the point Im trying to make is that with a
group like this with very untrustworthy people
youve got to trust each other because you have
to trust somebody You cant trust not anybody
because youre just alone
 We dont trust you
 Youve tried to steal from us twice
 Youve tried to steal from us Not
me us This is where the circle has to start
We will support you in doing some ridiculous
stuff but you have to keep it outside
 And that means sometimes you cant do
the thing you want because its going to be better
for everybody else and sometimes everybody else
is wrong but you have to go with it
 Nothing theres been no earned trust
 I actually did take a crossbow bolt
knocked myself unconscious trying to save your life
 I saved your life
 And it doesnt matter we start from
scratch This is where it starts
 When
 We didnt want it
 So if you really dont trust us Ill
happily take that  platinum back right now
 God youre making me agree with her
 See
 No were in it for what we can all grab
together Thats how these things work
 This is why the circus worked This is
why the circus was functional
 So do you think it would be a good idea
to explain to him that he almost got himself
killed tonight Turning on a bunch of people he was
working with he almost got himself killed tonight
for nothing
 And youre not nearly as smart as you
think you are
 I try not to have ideas about people
they just get in the way
 If you do bring all of this stuff so he
can actually do something useful
 No he created this situation Im all
right with this
 Well we get to tell him now dont we
 And stop expecting people to earn
things You just have to sometimes go with it
 We literally caught you stealing our
stuff Heres an extra platinum
 I did
 When they catch them stealing their
stuff yes they do
 Fjords stuff technically
 She was stealing
 Here you can cast Friends on me Ill
tell you everything you want to know
 Oh gods suddenly Im compelled to
answer everything truthfully Oh no more of
whatever youre drinking I cant help stop ack
 I feel that
 There was an extra platinum in there
 Take the items and the unearned trust
downstairs
 Oh no thats coming too
 Take the things well see you in a bit
 Natural 
 You would think so but no I think
theyre doing something
 I heard something
 It sounded like a thump
 Yeah thats something we can find out
in the morning
 Theres a way to do it
 Were going this way
 d no con modifier
 Okay
 All right Six
 Huh
 All right well wait for you
 Im going to wake up and go see what the
girls are doing
 Im going to point out because I took
Tough
 So Im at  hit points
 But now I burn through more to use my
swords
 Trying to rip the cart off the dead
horses
 I think we would need a proper smuggler
for that
 A wellbuilt cart with a secret
compartment
 No I dont know a smuggler I dont
know anybody in this city
 Oh god
 We have some reading if you like Im
going to grab the copy of Tusk Love

 Try and relax But not too much
 Bam Bam
 Thats a daycare
 Im normally not impressed by
eccentrics so this is really impressive
 It is
 We had the talk Im willing to let it
slide
 Thats fair Ah Sword Boots Daggers
 Oh not right here of course
 I think thats It could be dangerous
Its better if they initiate because then we learn
information immediately
 Thats what I was thinking
 I was starting to go in that direction
 This is Clarota aftershock
 Lets go shopping at Pumat Sols and
then well divvy up everything when were in private
 I think were probably going to need a
couple of healing potions as well
 Im going to window shop then Thank
you
 It was expensive
 Greater healing potion yeah
 Potion of healing
 Careful if youre filtering by type I
was having a problem with that Its potion of
healing
 Its black Its not green blue or
purple Its black text It took me a second to
realize
 I was doing a look around to see if
there was anything new
 
 The cloak was the most exciting thing
 Wow Ten episodes
 The bag
 This is really bloody heavy
 You could actually
 I know someone who might really enjoy
this if you dont want it
 We took them all outside and they stayed
there
 I think I know somebody who could really
enjoy this and Ill hold on to it for a friend
 I think Yasha might get a kick out of
it
 Ive known Yasha a long time she makes her
way back around
 Well eventually need a bath and well
find her again
 Its worth holding onto
 I think Im pretty good with this
 Ugh
 Im wondering if the guards are already
there looking at the mysterious explosion that
happened in that house
 Oh sorry friend Ive got one of those
faces people tend to recognize
 Oh Ill go with it
 Dont know
 You fuckers dont know shit
 So excited
 Far too long
 Ah yes its been quite an interesting
two years
 Well catch up we need a table we need
drinks for me and my compatriots
 Its a long story and I cant tell you
everything right now You know how it is
 Literally everything coming back to
haunt me Okay cool
 The second she turns Im going to turn
and give Fjord a little pat on the back and make a
whisper really quickly
 Yeah Im gonna whisper in Fjords ear
Im sorry this is my nightmare please just go
with it Its Lucien And Im back around Pass it
on
 
 Yasha
 Im apparently Lucien from two years
ago From two years ago Its Lucien remember
Its been ages
 Im so glad to see you
 Its Lucien Its Lucien
 Ill explain later just go with it
please
 I dont know Well find out
 Just go with it Ill explain later
 Ill explain later
 I hate you
 It might be easier just to have them all
killed right now I didnt say that out loud I
didnt say that out loud Im just thinking out
loud oh god Its going to be fine Im not
panicking
 Come sit down I give the tabaxi
another hug as we sit down How have you been
Its been ages
 Thats my name
 Who can keep track these days Again a
long story
 That is a story for another day and
another drink What did you see God I dont
know what that looked like from the other end of
things
MATT Well it all went belly up two years ago
You told us to scatter and vanish if it didnt
if things went wrong and wait until you returned
We buried your ass in the woods outside of the
hideout I mean 
 It may not have necessarily been my ass
that you buried
 I had a few tricks up my sleeve
 Obviously Is everybody else all right
I know it has been a while I had to stay
underground
 Damn shame
 Damn shame
 No actually Im
 Where is Tyffial I would rather
obviously deliver everything in person Honestly
if I had known you were here I wouldve made
arrangements I didnt want to shock you
 Im working on something very delicate
I need everything to be very quiet
 Where are my manners
 They dont know a lot but theyre
trustworthy Ive been putting my trust in them so far
 Thats actually fair
 Technically advantage because its kind
of the truth
 Yeah I think thats advantage I begged
for advantage on that one
 Okay thank you
 Its good to be seen again But again
its got to be very quiet right now Its been
like three other names since the last time I saw
you
 Please keep it quiet for now That book
caused more trouble than you think and it all
laid on my shoulders I was trying to protect the
rest of you from some of the worst elements of
that and I dont want any heat dropping on anybody
who doesnt know whats coming yet
 But let me know where they are and Ill
get a hold of them But dont let them know why yet
  Thats again mixed company and
public company
 Mixed results
 You dont have to tell them anything you
dont want to tell them thats all right
 Foolishness in thinking I knew what I
was doing
 Thats the answer youre getting
 You work for The Gentleman these days
 How is it working for The Gentleman
 Im looking at our friend
 All right Ill saunter over with my
drink and sit down at the table Come on everyone
lets do this
 Shes giving out leaflets
 It is definitely Crees speciality
 Lucien at the table is fine
 I trust you with this Dont get fancy
 Not anymore
 There was nothing fishy in the card
shuffle in the cut was there
 Lets do it 
 High profile but low profile
 Shes quick to toe the party line
 Just

 Great thought not now Good thought
 
 Im beginning to imagine it right now
actually
 Thats very nice
 That is certainly one to grow on
 Doesnt actually switch hands you just
do this a lot
 That is so baller Oh my god
 I will say the only thing that I can
think of that I would want not even necessarily
addend to this contract if we are going to do
this to you Im looking to stay on the down low
in general If we can agree even my presence in
this city necessarily is as far as its
concerned is none of anybodys concern outside
this bar I would be forever grateful
 I figured you would
 Sometimes
 Remember the name Lucien doesnt leave
this bar Outside I never want to hear it uttered
 Brilliant
 Quality not quantity
 Im taking a long look at Cree and I
want to see if I see any of the things that I
expect to see
 I want to see if theres any markings
or anything otherwise that I would expect to see
 All right
 Because its better that way Perception
check Wow thats a terrible roll Thats a five
 All right Thats fair
 Yasha Do I deal with this or do I not
deal with this
 I dont want to deal with this
 I hate this Im going to stand up and
walk over to Cree
 A lifetime ago
 I have a weird question and I apologize
for it The spell I used to get away it I
wasnt there for as long as you thought I was I
missed how everything ended in the end I hate to
ask but I was long gone before anything really
started to go down How did everything end Can
you just Ill explain why in a moment
 Thats where I lost you then
 Im going to have to find her again at
some point The reason Ive stayed quiet It was
never going to work Somebody was working against
me I dont know who but I cant trust anyone I
saw how you reacted to seeing me and it was Im
willing to believe it wasnt you who turned But
it could have been her but it could have been one
of us Thats why I need you to keep it quiet Please
 
 There will come a moment when I can tell
you everything but Its so complicated Please
just keep it quiet for now
 Until I know that everyones going to
react the way that you did to seeing me
 I will tell you everything eventually
 I give a hug
 Its been too long
 Im sorry for everything And I give the
pat and head back to the table
 Im going to walk over with a new round
of drinks Here drink this Im told theyre stupid Ugh
 Lucien for the moment Well talk about
it later
 In here were Lucien
 Lets have that conversation somewhere
else I dont know whos listening here
 Yeah that was a weird amount of into
you wasnt it
 Im going to cut my finger a bit and
bleed into it
 Is it wine
 Worth a try
 We will have this conversation outside
this bar
 Luciens not going to answer any
questions Molly will answer every question you
have later
 Thank you for coming back Ive missed
you
 Why do you need to know so many things
 Theyre not used to you yet
 I could use a hand for a bit
 Id owe you one
 She is definitely not joshing
 Why would we be set up
 Well check but shit happens and
youve got to be doing something when shit
happens We just happened to be doing something
 Its hardly a coincidence
 What we commonly referred to in the
circus as Yashaing
 Its a sight to behold
 You said that in this bar
 Lets not say anything in here that we
wouldnt want to be circulated
 Wait is that a beer
 Shes not a Crick
 God was it a year and a half ago
 Give or take How many people are
listening in on this clearly right now
  Actually no  sorry
 Can we please stop talking in here
 They are serving us free drinks of
course theyre listening to everything we say
Lets retire for the evening
 We can come back and do this tomorrow
 You talk to Kara then but no more
whatever this is
 I am genuinely a little drunk and
didnt remember who the Myriad were
 What am I doing deception Ten So I
have to tell the truth I have no idea Id
literally forgotten because Im a little drunk and
Im really preoccupied right now
 I know I was just doing it to fuck with
them
 
 Situationally it could be a thing
 Yeah weve been talking about the
sword
 Yeah
 Well hold on Well see if you want to
play around with it Fjord
 Yeah Many things are taller than Nott
 Interesting stuff there
 That is a fair point
 Ive been informed by Jester that she is
now to use the Wand of Smiles

 From the darkness she strikes
 For a complete list of those incentives
head on over to geekandsundrycom
 That is a very fine idea
 I think that also sounds like a very
fine idea
 Thats a fair point
 Pageturner
 Not yet
 It was DD ramen
 How are we going to get him through the
city with a blindfold on
 Everyones a shady pair in this group
Somehow even as individuals we are all
somehow shady pairs It is just inevitable
 Is this Marisha or is this Beau
 Never mind
 Weve all been Lucien
 So Well I was born on the continent
of I really
 I genuinely thought I would have some
bullshit together by now and Im really sort of stuck
 Its dangerous though Its officially
dangerous
 At this point whats the difference
 But seriously Ive been part of a shady
group Ive been dealing with shady friends for as
long as I can remember If theres one thing Ive
learned about dealing with people that you cant
trust is that you have to trust them where you
can and not trust them where you cant Im not
saying that I know what Im doing or anything but
I dont want anybody I want this to work I need
this to work Ive not done this in a while All
right
 Yeah thats interesting isnt it This
might even be easier if you just ask questions I
really dont know how to tell this story
 I woke up without any names or any
past buried in the ground two years ago
 Obviously not
 In the dirt
 My first memory my oldest memory is
dirt in my face underground
 How honest do I have to be
 Okay
 I rolled a four
 All right thats not entirely true
Its a vague memory I dont really remember it
Its kind of all jumbled Its what Ive been
told about some of it
 I dont know
 There is no before Whatever happened
before is not me Its not part of anything

 Some asshole got buried in the dirt
Fuck him I am enjoying what Im doing I want
nothing to do with that Anything that came
before I was happy to just leave it be
 No
 How would I know
 Thats somebody else
 No not exactly
 Some of them yes
 Days I was a bit out of it Its hard
to remember I wasnt speaking really Do you
have memories from your childhood
 It felt like that Its all bright and
more meaningful than it should be There was just
nothing I was practically catatonic I was barely
speaking
 Alone
 Id like to think so
 I dont know I dont know who that was
Ive never heard the name Lucien before or that
other name Ive never heard of any of it
 Yeah well I like pretending
Pretendings great
Who cares where anybody came from
 Thats possible except of course she
had weird blood powers
 Few months after I came to I started
noticing I could do things knew things that I
didnt necessarily know I knew
 Yeah I can can I see that dagger
 Pick one
 Ice
 Oh no I can were here This is
happening Thats fine
 Yeah
 I really dont Whoever that was came to
that end and I want nothing to do with that
Whatever it was it doesnt feel good when I the
moment when something creeps through I dont like
it I dont want anything to do with it I was
happy I liked the circus The circus was great
 Yes
 Thats a good Laura
 You can be monosyllabic if you like with
these people
 Mmhmm
 Yeah whatever that was Not without me
feeding it to them first I mean Ive conned
people Weve all conned people Ive used other
names before
 A lot of this was in the hopes that
maybe it would never happen keep moving keep quiet
 But Ill say this and Im going to put
the knife down Is there anything sharp around
Anything at all
 Something thats even ridiculous like
something not normal
 Perfect Im just going to cut myself
again on the wooden frame and grab it and use radiance
 Ill admit this is new
 You got to see the first time this
happened
 Not that Im Well no Thats fair
sure Well it was worth it every time
 Okay heres the thing that youre not
catching That wasnt me This is mine I dont
want anything from that other person anymore That
person is someone else I dont want anything to
do with it I did not feel good coming out of
that It was Im in for a penny might as well
Im told although I dont entirely remember this
part that I only said the word empty over and
over again for the first week
 I dont know what that means
 Empty I dont know Barely remember
 That sounds terrible I dont want to
remember anything I dont want to anybody elses
baggage in my head and I dont want anybody elses
problems thoughts ideas I like this person
right now is a good person Is a fine person Is a
happy person
 Sounds shifty
 Nope I dont want it
 We all have a few I assume
 Can you imagine what it would feel like
to not feel anything about anything that had
happened to you so far
 Why am I not surprised
 Its very freeing Its the best thing
its the thing that happened to me Its not the
best thing that happened to me its the thing
that happened to me I found peace in building a
new person The Moonweaver
 What if it feels that I owe it
something
 I spent two years before I met you all
cajoling people occasionally ripping them off
occasionally doing a good turn here or there
Never trust the truth The truth is vicious The
truth thinks you owe it something None of that I
like my bullshit Its good Its happy It makes
other people happy
 It is exactly who I am
 Well do you know who the Moonweaver
is
 Excellent The swords are cheap carnival
glass Theres nothing special about them
 Literally a decorated pair of swords to
make them look special
 Thats true
 Things came back quick and the circus
helped They were good people They did a lot of
me and joy can fill an awful lot of a persons
life
 Maybe I feel tinges of things on
occasion nothing I like
 Because I always lie and bullshit
 I may be a liar but Im never a
betrayer Im honest in my work and I believe in
doing a good turn Ive never cheated you out of
money Ive never robbed from you I stayed with
that circus for two years I know how people treat
each other Its important And all that stuff you
told me before Ive got to admit I didnt even
listen to any bit of it I was just trying to
teach you a lesson I dont care where youve
been I dont care what terrible things any of you
have done Youre here now This is how it works
 Yes darling
 Of course
 I use fortunes to tell people what I see
in them But sometimes sometimes I feel like
maybe theres something that tickles the back of
my head I will admit
 Some days
 Am I lying
 Thank you
 I always try to be helpful when I turn
cards for people
 People are looking for a path theyre
looking for a path And Ill tell you and this
is true I did my best every town I went to and
every town I left no matter how they treated me
and a lot of them treated me with deep
disrespect
 I left every town better than I found
it
 Is it yeah no So I show off the
peacock a little bit One of the peacock feathers
on the neck
 Thank you Liam One of the eyes on one
of the peacock feathers is a bright crimson red
which any of you if youd ever made a fucking
insight check would know God I was waiting for
you to fuck with me Its also the same place that
he bleeds every time that he uses any of his
powers Theres also a red eye on the snake on the
palm and theres a red eye on the snake on the
opposite side of the hand
 There are various
 Im just showing the snake the two
snake eyes Im showing the peacock eye And then
Im going to show the eye in the floral
arrangement
 I tried to cover them but they wouldnt
take ink So I just did my best
 No I dont know what they are
 I dont know
 I dont
 But now that you bring it up because
Id never occurred to it I might start
 Oh that was for Caleb Never mind
sorry
 Who butt shaves
 Anything else before were done here
 No We tried
Thats dangerous work and itll
usually backfire No interest in that Its mostly
just trying to help people get their shit
together Did someone send you on the wrong path
 Thats fair I dont care to be fair
 Yes Everything I like the safety of
it and if I had had my way this wouldve been a
conversation for a later date But I need to
protect you and myself from whatever that is so
you need to know that that is a wild card
 Its a terrible name
 I dont ever want to know who that
person is
 Let me make this abundantly clear My
name is Molly That person is dead and not me
Its just a person who had this body They
abandoned it its mine now
 And I feel that youre fretfully
ignorant and filled with platitudes But I still
like you regardless
 Maybe he killed goblins Maybe he was a
goblin hunter Maybe he ate them Raw
 This was not how I expected this to go
Thank you
 Im waiting for the spell to dissipate
before I say anything
 I both like you more and less at the
same time
 Thank you dear 
 Even that undead wispy things is that
triggering anything in the brain
 
 Undead orbs
 Theyre basically willowisps You
usually find them in swamps or things like that
 Yes Am I smoldering
 Yes
 I know Anyway All right
 Did you do this alone or was I in the
room when this happened I would have loved to
have watched this
 I walk up get a little uncomfortably
close put my hand on your chest The power was in
you all along See you at breakfast
 Did you just tell a joke
  Its a shame It was a very good
one
 Shes slowly sharpening a blade at home
just
 Do I recognize these people
 Okay I may have the chill cloak
flipped to try and be a little less conspicuous
rolling around for what its worth
 Were probably going to be dealing with
some restless spirits actually so if theres
anything to deal with some of these
phantasmagorical creatures willowisps that
sort of thing
 Yeah inevitably
 Perfect Thats exactly what I was
looking for was two vials of holy water
 Probably need some healing potions or
something
 Well make some money
 I think were pretty well taken care of
at this point
 Ive never seen you blush before
 We should probably go to the blacksmith
at some point
 Has she punched you in the face yet
 I think she likes you
 Ill take that money Itll be no
problem
 We can to be fair get all  of those
throwing darts for one gold
 Yeah
 It was worth it
 I am going to turn around and
immediately head towards the other bar The
Evening Nip
 Im going to let you know Tell them Im
hiding at the bar and Ill meet them there when
its time
 Thats a good call
 Ill go behind Yasha
 Yeah thats a good order
 Hey Beau I pull out one of the holy
water flasks Think you know what to do with this
 Just in case
 Who do you think the other one should go
to
 Maybe Nott might be safer
 Youre not in a boat with us
 This one you throw
 Know how to throw stuff
 If there was a basket for trash and you
threw it
 Wow thats exciting
 That doesnt count Thats cocked
 Way less
 Ill take that So when we get into the
boat together Im going to give you the other
holy water flask
 And you have a holy water now
 Please feel better
 Its going to be in there isnt it
 Everybody have their stuff together
 The back of the boat would actually be
up a bit
 Youve got your holy oil right
 I believe or was it
 You throw it at something that looks
evil Its pretty simple
 It doesnt work that way sadly Its
not
 Water balloon with glass
 Is the general feeling of supernatural
unease coming from either of the or any signs
of I know that were going to be facing
probably some willowisps or something like that
 Any sound coming from either of them
 You could literally be walking along
side of the boat
 I would assume Im in the middle
 Seven
 Thats nice
 Im going to take out my swords and
just Im going to try and cleave some of these
tentacles off See if I can start to get it to
lose its grip Im going to take my first shot
Im going to stop saying that Thats a  to
hit
 Thank you Nine points of damage
 Welcome We probably should head towards
the other one
 That ends my turn
 But we can boat in there
 What are those things on the side
 Okay
 That was an intense roll right now
 Oh

 Sure I know Are they within striking
distance
 Im going to hold my action until
somethings within striking distance
 I will also say Im at least going to
back up to the side of the boat where Im far
enough away from that thing as humanly possible
 Oh well fine
 Yeah
 Didnt you cast a Light spell
 Lets park the boats
 Does that sound like a willowisp
 Does this ring any bells then
 More expensive things tend to be up but
Im happy to start with down
 I didnt even catch that
 Im after Jester or after Fjord
 Cats can see your soul
 Im going for it
 Its classic really
 This is a great installation
 Do I recognize any of these symbols
Does anything look familiar
 Skills
 I got acrobatics insight deception
sleight of hand
 Investigation and survival also
 Thats my thought
 You dont have a heal cantrip do you
 I hand Nott a handful of ball bearings
 We can fix that
 Is that including the bonus
 Wow
 Oh well done with oh my god your
hand
 Thats ugh
 Did you just pocket a thumb
 I think lets all head up in that
direction but put Frumpkin first I think
Frumpkin ahead but lets
 Were also going to have to keep
checking for traps and then well send people down
when we need it
 Well weve got to figure out what we
 Ill take third
 Still  down
 Im going to go check out the other
alcove
 Three red urns
 Im going to take a look at the other
one
 Im going to start with one of my
blades
 Yeah
 Im looking at the other urn Is
anything happening
 Oh my god really
 I rolled the same initiative
This is the worst initiative ever
 Seven
 Im trapped in that well never mind
Damn it
 Oh that hits
 Wow
 I know what these things are
 Do I understand whats happening with
why theyre going back to the pots to whatevers
in the pots
 Im actively tracking these at this
point I would imagine so I cant be surprised anymore
 All right Can I scoot around the I
assume the clay pot is on the other side of that
willowisp right now
 Im going to scoot around to that side
 Im going to take my first shot at the
willowisp as Im dancing around it
 Yeah lets see if this hits 
 My god really
 Im going to take my bonus action and
Im going to break the pot
 Yes I do  points
 All right thats eight points of
damage
 Other than that Im going to take a look
at it down below to see if theres anything in
there thats weird
 The one on the roof
 Im going to pick up the bottom half of
that and Im going to examine immediately what
Ive got
 I was going to say Yasha maybe
 We should probably put a light in
there
 This is how they clean the room
 We already have a rope down
 Oh yeah short rest
 I believe in you This is fine
 How big are the bevels that have
the relief of the 
 And the bowls
 Mmhmm Clean them off a bit
 Ive got an idea Im going to start
rocking upstairs
 Im walking upstairs
 I have the bowls
 Im going to take a look at that
purple is there only one of those little purple
glowing rocks that seems to be creating light
 Im going to open it and I will Im
going to poke at it to see if it seems trapped or anything
 All right

 Im going to open it and grab the stone
out
 Thats a six
 Beau
 Can you punch this
 Is that your new nickname
 Simple tool
 Well you did do this I wont tell
anyone come on
 We walk back down with it Beau
retrieved this maybe Weve got a glowing rock
Im going to put it in the room see if anything
happens
 Weve got these bowls Im going to put
the bowls gingerly Im going to put one of the
bowls on one of the symbols to see what happens
 Put it middle of the star
 Im going to try and move the bowl to
match the engravings in the ceiling
 Whats the the top of the rod again The
top of that little spiral
 Im going to examine it anything
interesting about it Just a small metallic knob
 Like a lightning rod
 Lets do the other two
 Crickets
 Eight
 The radiant didnt seem to have an extra
effect then
 Are you staying next to it or you
 Yeah you dont need to
 Does that get halved because of raging
 Im going to try just for shits and
giggles Im going to activate the ice damage on
my sword Im going to run up where am I Over
there Im going to run up take a swing at that corner
 So thats  to hit
 I know its like just in case I will
be the one to miss And thats six plus one ice
so thats seven damage
 Its my bonus to activate it
 Im going to back off into the corner
then
 Yeah so Im using that
 Whoa
 Is it racial features or class
features
 It would be racial features
 Class features
 At disadvantage
 Advantage is over
 What
 No these things happen
 Well we have to do it in the bowl
 There is a room outside this room where
it seems like there was a room for maybe preparing
the bowls
 I would say the one that I had I
probably polished up
 Ill hold the bowl Im resistant to
fire
 Look at this
 There we are
 We need transmutation
 Thats
 And we need enchantment
 Illusion and enchantment
 I dont think it turns
 Ive got an idea I think I know how it
works now
 This is great I think that this is a
guide We know what we need to know because of
these bowls I think we need all three of these
versions of the spells placed in each of these points
 Everybody stand at their point
  Are you sure
 We need transmutation and illusion
 If anything starts to happen I want you
to run for the door
 That would be the three dots
 We need fighters
 Just in case Im going to light my
other sword too
 I would stand in front of the symbols on
the triangle personally
 Check for traps
 Im going to start heading in this
direction too Does one of them look like it was
possibly holding a gelatinous cube at some point
 Dont spoil it for her Well find out
in an hour or so anyway
 Yay double digits
 Ill go take a look at the other cage
 
 Would I be insane for thinking this is
how they make them
 This was a factory maybe
 I want to wait for Caleb at this point
 Ive got a light stone in my pocket if
anyone wants to go for it Here hold on
 Careful
 This cant go wrong
 Put it in the bag
 Are those ceramic pots giving anything
off
 Character details under description
 Is there an audiobook version of this
 Whats in the urn
 I want to take a look at some of these
cages with the urns
 I saw something happen in that cage
 My clay pot is glowing
 Five
 Thank you
 Hes tucking
 He could tuck
 Ha ha
 Natural 
 
 Im going to try and break the pot in
through the cage Im going to take a swipe at the
pot through the cage with my sword
 Nine
 Im going to swing around and try to get
another shot
 Stop doing that Youll get everyone
drunk Even worse Thats actually a natural one
 Im going to run towards Im in combat
with it It gets an attack of opportunity if I
run doesnt it Im going to steady myself and
prepare for another attack
 Nott deal with this
 Thats a number Yeah that hits
 Hmm thats a shitty roll
 Do you get an attack of opportunity
 Pots people pots
 Im useless on the pots Im actually
going to try and make a book for the cloaked guy
Hit the bloody pots
 Thats fine
 That hits
 Oh my god really
 Yeah Pots people Im going to take
two strikes with the radiant swords Thats a 
to hit
 An eight to hit
 Okay thats all right
 Does it do extra radiant damage I mean
because I do an extra bonus radiant damage if it
takes it
 Oh so yeah Thats   points
of radiant damage
 Six is radiant and the rest is the
sword
 Doesnt he have crossbow advantage
 Youre going to be all right Fjord
 Were all right here
 
 I get an attack of opportunity
 That hits thats  Thats five points
of normal damage and five points of radiant damage
 I want to swing and pin the heart to the
ground and leave the blade there
 Last pot
 Im going to run over to you and put a
healing
 I dont care I dont know any of that
Thats a healing potion
 Im going to go looking for one in one
second Potion of healing just a standard d
So take six points of heal youre stabilized
 Back up come on
 I also definitely lost my two swords
now so those are off
 The swords are not glowing anymore
 I had to feed a healing potion I had
two going so I needed hands
 You can do something if you like Pot
Pot
 There was no heart on the ground
 
 Its coming from the bookcase
 Do I see this
 Im going to quickly cast before this
goes I dont know
 Im going to cast one level
 Nope
 Move the bookcase
 Im going to run over to it and start
taking slices at it Im going to stab it with my sword
 Mmhmm Two shots
 All right First one is  to hit
 Thats eight points of damage
 Im taking another swing
 Thats  to hit
 Thats five points of damage
 Is there any way to get in there
 Im going to start trying to open it up
I want to go in there look for things and break
every damn
 I use all my hit dice when I heal
because of Tough right There was something I got
 I feel like I got that though
 Was there something else that does
that
 I feel like there was a thing Ill have
to keep reading
 What does the mantle look like
 Does it look familiar
 I was hoping
 What else did you get out of there
 That is a good idea
 Everythings in the pile Including the
stuff in the second chest
 The stuff in the second chest
 I heard two traps go off
 Anything you take on your own time is
yours Were on the clock
 Were not stealthy doing this
 Greener than normal
 Or fill in the blanks
 He did have feet They were just
somewhere else
 Im taking a ring How many are there
 Thats fair
 That was not a good deed That is
literally baseline of whats expected
 Im taking an extra one for helping you
remember that youre supposed to share
 You can put it in your ear
 Lets keep it all together then for
now Except for the books
 Got to do business
 Advantage or no
 No Thats a one
 A one
 Tie it up and bundle it
 I wonder if youll come out in one of
the Nine Hells but only a third of you
 Youre welcome
 There are literally going to be rock
monsters if we go back the other way
 Not far
 Were only going an hour down tops
 Are we taking a cat
 Thats fair Lets just
 Good to know
 Ill join this
 Is there a place to tie it off
 Perception That would have been ten
again
 Im already taking off my jacket Im
taking off everything that I dont want to get
wet keeping just one sword and Im going to go
for it
 Weirdly there are no nipple rings
Those things are dangerous They catch on shit
 
 Im going in
 Im crawling up into it man
 No because its going to have a flow
because the water is coming down We have to tie
it off on something
 Ill let you know when I get there
 Yeah Where is it Im so excited I
want to hear your white noise
  Ive always wanted to do
this
 We seem to keep finding these I am
going to examine this thing
 Seven
 Magic
 I will pick up the skull and take a look
at it It is human
 All these checks Wheres my medicine
There 
 Very true Well on your way Yorick I
set it adrift
 Im going to also keep my eyes open Im
going to try to get a little bit down into this to
see if theres any bits and pieces underwater
 Do a little pat down
 
 All right Im going to kick my way back
up to the boat
 A lot of bad decisions Several boats
 Someone who didnt quite get away
 I think I should find that gross but
Im kind of into it
 We did find one interesting thing
 a
place to stash things if we dont want them to be found
 Well If we come out the other way then
we know how to get back down here
 Good to know
 Wet
 Somewhere in the world right now
someones laughing
 That was fun
 Thats a bit deep in there
 I think at the top personally
 Oh thats a whole different show
 You did great
 Do I believe him
 One
 Im rolling so well
 If you kill them then theyre not
really your friends are they
 Exactly
 Its probably time
 
 There was a lot in there though
 We could have strapped them both to your
back
 Quite a few willowisps
 Quite a few traps
 Was there a gelatinous cube at one
point
 I smack her on the back of the head
 Thats right Youre up I swat
 Once weve figured out that the
willowisps were coming from pots we just broke
anything that looked like it might contain one
 A lot of images on the wall Weird magic
stuff
 Possibly a probing question would remind
some things Im trying to remember It was a bit daunting
 Well do our humble best
 Lets go pawn some things
 Lets clear some things out
 We didnt actually tell him about the
manacles
 A very dead guy
 I dont see why not
 Youve been waiting for that for too
long
 Several
 Specifically their feet
 Shes not a verbal learner
 I could tell
 Unless theres an opal in there Im
getting rid of the ring
 Oh thats fine Theyre probably fake
then
 Anything you took from the circus was
not real
 It was trade
 Commit to it
 Theres literally a cadaver that just
went into the building Not to give you ideas
 I would like to try some chemical
altered states
 Its time to have a good night
 Yeah
 Probably the celebratory first night
 Oh just before dusk
 I have no idea
 Theres only enough for two other people
to take it
 Well its a little late because I
already took mine Im waiting to see whats happening
 Whoevers sober keep us out of trouble
 Somehow she knows you you always do
this
 Im excited
 Oh yeah
 A wisdom saving throw 
 Im going walking
 Who wants to go to a cemetery right
now
 Im going to put on my least interesting
cloak and Im going to go find myself a cemetery
 Were going to work on it though
 Im going for a walk
 I have no idea
 This could come in handy
 
 Drink and a bathhouse
 You know what just occurred to me I
didnt have a childhood Ive never said that out
loud to someone before
 What happened to you
 Im so proud of you You did so well
 Oh yeah everybody lets take a bath
 Oh yeah look at that I dont think
Ive ever been there before
 Whats it say
 Well start a brand new text thread
 I own some really nice Lederhosen
 No were you Oh thats the other
pair
 It sounds like theres very expensive
things to drink and eat Im going to get my pocketbook
 I think were all up and moving at this
point
 I think youve had enough
 Its making you weird
 I definitely want to see this
 Im very much about this Well get that
togo
 I sort of agree with Nott on this I
think there comes a point where its a skeleton
and not an actual dead person at this point I
mean I know it is a dead person
 I think theres a point where its like
a piece of fruit but its been out so long that
even conceiving of it as a piece of fruit is not
useful
 That is also a very fair point
 Fjord dont you dare have fun without
us Im rolling out the door
 I think were immediately heading to
Trebuchet
 Do you fire it Do you sit in it I
dont know Theres only one way to find out
 You shouldnt have hit that woman with a
sandbag
 No he paid already
 Its a dexterity With disadvantage
 
 I think I may have to Ive spent my
luck I think it may be off to you and then one for you
 Three throws One each
 Its still not terrible
 Thats a six
 Wait Right lets just
 Its out
 I hardly know but Ive thrown a baby
before Odd
 Mmm Mmhmm
  Tastes better with the
victory
 I won a strawberry
 This about when I run up
 Whatd you
get
 What are the options
 Ill take whatevers most expensive
 Mmhmm
 Can you rage at this thing when you
 You get another swing yeah
 Oh yeah no Ill do that when I see you
going in
 One silver four copper
 A barrel of books
 Im going to run up behind
 Caleb have
you run Detect Magic on any of this
 Just theres so much I figure
somethings got to be interesting
 I can absolutely do that Im going to
run towards the tapestry booth
 Im seeing if theres anything deeply
gaudy
 Thats beautiful How much is that
then
 How big is this piece out of
curiosity
 Its purchased Ten gold My god
 Bless you master craftsmen My god It
is such a rendition of the Platinum Dragon that
Ive never seen before I clutch at my Platinum
Dragon brooch Its beautiful
 Oh I have fucking plans people Swing
it over my shoulder and Ill be walking around
like a pike
 Is it just simple weapons or is it
simple ranged weapons
 Simple weapons okay
 Is it still disadvantage to the middle
target
 And the sword
 Were not eating the rats
 I also follow
 That was worth following around for
 Kingsman
 Mmhmm
 You should take a shot at that
 At the very least you have a lot to
prove
 Oh I wouldnt Oh
 You get to roll again
 I think Ive literally made  gold
since weve met minimum at this point Its been
like a week
 I think that if I saw lots of random
nines around the city I dont think Id know what
that was connected to
 Oh I think we are
 Id be all right with that
 Mollymauk
 What makes you think theyre not going
to start conscripting people tomorrow
 Maybe we should win the fight then
maybe think about getting out of town
 Made it at Kinkos
 That was good That was very good
 Ixnay
 
 Six
 Probably not
 Ill back up into mine
 That I think is the door where it
opens
 
 Im going to use Vicious Mockery and
arms its awful Its a psychic attack
 It says wisdom but is it charisma
 Okay yeah
 That saves
 Thats okay Im going to also use my
bonus action to light my other sword
 I have both blades going now so Im
knocking that down
 With not the ice the
 Im going to run lets see Ive got 
feet Im going to cross and run for cover behind that
 Yeah
 Its going to swallow people
 How many feet away am I from this
thing
 Im going to start dashing to that
next yeah that direction
 Im going to do one more attempt at
Vicious Mockery 
 He still saves
 Thats what I got
 Theres no short rest between here
and
 Plus seven
 Not before the next fight I dont
think
 Whats your medicine check
 Like heal
 No dont do that
 Focus on one target at a time
 Ill back up into that far corner
 Yeah
 
 Im going to take a run towards the fake
Jester
 Yeah its where I can get there Im
going to try and see if I can make Vicious Mockery
work on this thing
 I do have line of sight
  Bad doggy

 Yep butt turkey you heard me Thats
one point of psychic damage and it has
disadvantage next attack
 Eight
 I am not resistant to cold
 Ow
 No Im fine Im not fine but ow
 Ah Should have had disadvantage
 Its a cone Yeah okay
 All right
 Im going to take a slashing attack at
the guy right in front of me
 Thats oh goddamn it thats  to
hit
 Im going to hit it again Oh my god
its a natural fucking one

 Im going to try and circle around a
little bit to space everybody out a bit
 It still has disadvantage from the for
its attack though
 Barely Yasha could use some healing
 Im going to breathe deep and take a run
at this damn thing
 Straight into it and Im going to come
swinging out at it
 Thats a hit thats a  to hit
 This thing doesnt take extra damage
from this does it
 No thats fine Seven points of damage
for the first hit
 Is that right No wait yeah thats
right Then  to hit  to hit
 Thats seven points of damage again
 I want to go in and I want to see if I
can carve through the mouth as deep in Im going
to try and get right in there Im going to do a
dental jawbreaker
 Then they would be alone out there for
like two rounds
 That seems like a terrible plan
 Were all one hit away from
 I dont think we would get
 I think its a terrible plan
 This is such a bad idea
 This is such a bad idea
 This is going to be like two rounds to
get to whoever
 Youre going to be alone for two full
rounds with whatever this thing is
 Yeah what if youre there what if it
comes out of that door
 This is a terrible plan
 No theres one two
 Yeah no
 Im going to go to the opposite point
from Caleb
 Yeah
 Yeah this is so bad
 Were going to drop so fast
 Im going to go against the wall
against the back of that wall there
 Youre going to be at disadvantage
because its going to be right next to you
 Arent you glad you werent standing
there by yourself for that
 You get one
 It would have been three rounds before I
could do any damage Before it killed him
  Its my door Oh my god

 Overestimating the value of surprise
 Thats mildly adequate
 I should take it because for now
 Make your life a little easier because I
can keep disadvantage for your turn
 I was going to say what was the number
Because that things got to have a low AC Whats
the actual number
 Im up How dumb do I feel like being
 If its turned towards Fjord then Im
going to run around to the opposite side of it
 For flanking bonus Im going to take
two slices into his leg
 See I didnt do it and then you just
went ahead and did it Im working so hard not to
do it Whats the flanking bonus by the way
 All right so this is advantage on the
attack
 No not very often I was trying to
remember Im not feeling good about that one
Here we are Thats a  to hit
 I assume I dont get the extra bonus for
radiant
  Eight points of damage
 Then the next one is a natural 
Thats  points of damage
 All right
 Yeah Im holding
 Is he going to attack me
 Im definitely using Blood Maledict
then at full use That was not good that was
bad All right thats all right
 Yeah and the next one
 Yeah that hits
 Im out
 He has disadvantage on his next attack
as well
 Way too happy about that ten damage
 Also does that mean that his reaction
has been burned by the legendary action Is the
legendary action a separate thing from
 All right so hes still got a reaction
Just checking
 I dont
 
 That was not the critical
 Which you do not do
 So youre just unconscious
 Yeah
 Youre out
 Yeah but not That almost
 Yeah
 Oh I dont have to I get shocked from
my the chest The heart locket sparks and
 What
 Ready for this Its really cool
 No When you wear this pendant you
stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of
your turn In addition whenever you roll hit dice
to regain hit points the number of hit points
 Im unconscious but Im breathing
 Im just 
 Was that with the Hex
 You have to hit the confirm button
 Thats why I was like get it closer
 Does she roll the healing potion if I
take it or do I roll it
 Okay because I was curious if my locket
gives me does it count as my hit dice or no
 Okay
 Thank you
 Im going to crawl behind there and at
the very least I can
 To the west behind that rock right
there I can at the very least keep trying to
give him disadvantage on at least one attack
 Or also because hell get the one
legendary but other than that its whatever we
can get the fullest round
 Technically he hasnt had a oh no he
did because its a whole round back never mind
 Im working every bloody angle I can
think of
 Im going to go ahead and say demonic
voice You got hit in the face with a piece of
lollipop Im going to attempt to do four psychic
damage and give him
  Will you roll under 
eventually Okay
 I know
  Shh Go to sleep
 Is there a heal spell in the house

 That helps
 I need a drink
 Molly Charmed
 Thatll do
 Frequently not always
 Sometimes were out and about
 I cant believe I find myself agreeing
with Nott here We should get out of town while
its still possible
 You leave the table when youve got the
pot You dont wait for everything to go back to
the dealer
 At some point theyre going to start
looking for people to fight this war and Im not
sure I want to be around for it because boy they
know who we are now
 I still have a giant tapestry over my
shoulder
 I put it down before the fight
 I actually think maybe it should be her
and Beau because they wont recognize her and
human faces tend to blend into the crowd whereas
we do not
 Im not
 Remember how we talked about getting you
out in the world more and then you said you
didnt want to but then we said youre going to
have to do it anyway
 This is those times
 Shell take care of you
 Lets not even start making vague
promises Just be yourself and youll
be fine Just be anybody but yourself
and youll be fine Its going to be great
 Wow that was cocked
 That looked like it went well How bad
was it
 You said both of those things
 It didnt devolve into a punching fest
Thats pretty good
 Oh my god youve discovered why shes
been with my circus all this time working as a
bouncer
 If they try and kill you to get answers
then this way you dont know anything Then
youre really not worth anything
 What side are you on
 Exactly
 Finish the evening off right Ill
honestly say Id like to get out of here as soon
as possible so they dont think were running from
the news We get out of here before the news hits
 I dont care Im just happier moving
than staying still
 If it were just the two of us Id say
leave tonight but
 See if we can make it faster but 
hours is not terrifying
 No later than dusk I would like to get
out before news starts to spread Before they
decide to start locking down the holes
 Thats a fair point
 Are you drinking every random cup or are
you pouring them all into one cup
 Youre a trash person I walk over and I
take your last drink and drink it and salute
 I know
 Up early in the morning
 Yes
 Gluten almonds
 Were all going to be here to see this
open right
 Very fair
 Massage
 So long as theres a Cobalt Soul
Scholastic Fair really
 Hmm
 Its more than we used to make in a
year easily
 How deep of a sleeper are you
 Cool Well find out Im going to go
downstairs
 Im going to at least need the best
masseuse they have whos also willing to do other
interesting things And someone to feed me and
talk to me as the entire thing is going on
 I would imagine so
 Fruit Dont be crass Thats just
weird
 Best hands best conversationalist
Surprise me
 I pay it and you can sleep through it
or not if you like
 Welcome back to college man
 Oh yes Had you not put that together
yet
 We got two rooms
 Oh excellent Are you on the bed
 Okay Im going to take the bed and Im
going to take my full massage and otherwise
 If you would also like some food Im
sure theyd be willing to
 Oh Im sure at the very least I knock
on the door and say Im having fruit if anyone
wants anything
 Its mostly ridiculous conversation
through this whole thing
 Yeah
 
 Oh is the food arriving
 Okay in that case I am going to
enter
 Oh no Ive thought about this I had
time to think while watching things outside Not
you guys Ive got the remnants of the fruit Im
coming in with the food into their room and I am
wearing nothing but my tapestry

 I am your god long may I reign Eat of
my fruits
 Its good I got through a lot of this
 If anybody had any questions they want
to ask Lauras in the bathroom
 Just looking forward to wearing a giant
Platinum Dragon Thats all I wanted
 We have a cart
 Im going to get the map
 Im happy to move in whatever direction
anybody likes
 Whats the good side of this then
Whats your bestcase scenario
 If they lock the gates or start
conscripting
 I dont know what theyd do All I know
is I dont want to hang out and obviously weve
made a bit of a reputation for ourselves
 Hes an ally now
 Have you literally never left a town
without telling everybody because you know
theres a possibility youre going to get
conscripted to go fight a war
 See that sounds like our speed Not
conscripting into fighting on the front lines
 Dont think they dont know our names
now
 I think we should be careful because
the longer were in town the more people we talk
to the more people might decide that theyre
invested in us staying
 To Dolans Well meet up at Pumats
 We can pull Matts soul
 Were going to do our best Were going
to see how its going to be
 Just a thought to check the board also
get our stuff from the Leaky Tap
 Possible private escorts Private
escort either north or
 Sure
 You have our deepest sympathies at your
position This is obviously going to be a very
difficult time
 Thats a lot
 I think its The Gentleman
 I feel like  gold is buying an
awful lot of cooperation More cooperation than I
think Im capable of
 Then well meet them at the shop
 You wrote all this
 We did our taxes
 Yeah
 I would imagine right now especially
 Do you feellucky
 Lets go to Pumats and lets get the
rest of them together Im sure by now
 No
 I think we should get out of town while
the gettings good
 Youre conscripted once you start
earning that 
 Or you sign it and then the next time
you come across some soldiers of the Empire they
have you executed for treason for running off on
it
 Oh
 I dont know
 Sounds like an expensive enemy to make
 Im legitimately happy to go in any
direction far away from the front line
personally
 I think its a slippery slope
 Its conscription
 I agree They say theres kids
disappearing up north
 I like it
 Do we make a polite exit at the least or
do we just bugger out
 Im fair for that
 Just in case
 The DMs Guide
 I couldnt make potions with alchemist
supplies could I
 All right
 Quick huddle
 Im happy just to leave the city
 Do you have a lozenge
 Shouldnt be offering things that you
dont have
 If we happen to bring him in even if we
werent under contract
 Im too tired to make proper decisions
 Should have left in the middle of the
goddamn night
 Knew it was coming
 d for me Six
 I add six to the rolled HP
 All right
 Oh wait I get a bunch of weird shit
were going to have to have a talk
 I get a new blood curse I want to have
a conversation about that before we go into that
 Im excited to see what insane shit I can
do My proficiency bonus did it automatically go up
 That is the best birthday meal
 I get nervous spending too much time in
one place but if everyones going then were going
 Youre at a table youre doing well
Eventually youre going to want to walk away from the table
 The table always offers you four times
the amount youve ever seen You got to walk away
while youre winning But all right
 Seems a little late for a wager at this
point
 Fair Im in
 Shit
 Not like it hasnt happened before
 Did I notice him casting Haste
 Okay
 Blood curse of the eyeless Full
strength
 The darkest
 Galaga
 I pull the full Riker hop over the
chair

 I mean Im on one of the horses Yeah
 Oh no Thisll be funny Come on first

 Does it look like happy fire smoke or
bad unfortunate somethings burning dark
 No well do this later Do you see the
smoke over there
  Everybody theres smoke over
there Weve got to get hold of this right now
Theres definitely a plume of smoke I dont know
what it means I dont know what its about it
could be a good thing it could be a bad thing
but we have to stop this conversation right in its tracks
 Honestly I cant tell from here Its
very localized
 Is it into the woods or further along
 Its about a mile off the road
 It doesnt look like chimney smoke Im
not sure
 Does it look like campfire smoke
 Theres people though Or something
 I mean just be on alert They could be
burning anything
 Well find once and for all the
 Theyll be happy to see a cat
 I dont think were even going to pull
over
 For a bit
 Im following
 Great
 That seems fair
 Selling any wares Or do you need any
news from the other side of the road
 There are skirmishes at the border and
soldiers are moving east lots of them worth
noting Were trying to avoid it
 For sale
 Oh yeah
 Yeah thats still
 We have some bits and pieces what do
you need We have gold but you dont really
strike me as the type who cares
 Ive got a few bits What do you need
Do you need tools
 Im going to pull out

a little thin on because were just on the road

 Thats a nice piece of hide armor

around all over the place right now
 Have a lovely day
 Ive met weirder
 And meat
 There was a trapdoor in the floor and
there were just people stuck underneath there

roll and Id have been like That carpet looks
like its been moved recently
 Its all right
 I think Ive met weirder people
 What kind of armor is it out of
 Its hide armor
 All right
 We made a friend
 Yes
 Hes very dead And then he rose up from
the grave again and we had to kill him again
Twice Same man
 Im thinking of planting soybeans
 Thatll do
 What kind of meat is this out of
curiosity
 Nope Its just going today
 As far as I know it could be veggie
 If only I had help counting to the
number four
 I think Im going to want more of this
Im not sure where its coming from
but I definitely think
 Im getting a taste for it
 Theres trees
 Yeah Ill take first watch Unless
someone objects All right thatll do Do you
want to or Whats your Ill take it
 But I have night vision
 
 Im so glad to be out of that bloody
city
 Its nice to be on the road again
 Ive never been up this way before
 Not that I can remember Not that I
know
 You havent done that before
 Well shes going to be gone for another
six days now
 Thats lovely
 
 I had 
 Do you roll a save against poison or
no
 Im going to run directly at the
creature right there On the way Im going to use
my bonus action to start one of my scimitars I
think I get two attacks with that scimitar then
 Yeah
 Setting my new max HP All right Attack
number one is  to hit
 Just double checking Im still at a d
for
 All right Thats   points
of damage
 Do I still have movement
 Im going to head around the tree for
the other one that
 Im going to take one shot at him
 Ugh Ten
 All right
 I know
 AC is 
 Whats the effect of the toxin or venom
again
 Im going to get the one in front of me
First attack thats all right Thats  to hit
 Thats eight points of damage
 One more  to hit
 Thats nine points of damage
 Im going to turn around to the one
thats behind me Im going to take a third hit
 
 Total of 
 Thats everything Well I could move
but no Im going to stay locked with
this one then No Im done
 Im going to use disadvantage
 Youre welcome
 Isnt it still slowed
 Oh its two Okay
 Oh thats cool
 Welcome to the world of tanking
 Im going to take a
 Thats 
 Thats five points of damage
 Im going to run towards the horses
where they came off to the left and as I pass
that wolf Im going to take a couple swipes at
it
 Thats an  and a  roll
 Lets just see what that does before I
see if I even take a third shot Thats 
 points of damage
 Im going to keep heading towards the
cart to see if that goblin is still there
 Well yeah and Im heading my way
because I saw that one run off to the
 With a Vicious Mockery too
 Might as well
 Go scrape that up off the ground
 I was already on my way there
 It tastes like wolf and ogre
 Thats fair
 At this point am I back with all of the
gold and all of the sacks
 Well Im sleeping underneath the cart
Im picking up all the stuff This has been very
enlightening There is probably going to be
lightning Anyone else who wants to join me
 Well snuggle
 Im going to make a little camp
underneath the cart
 Join me under the cart
 A band of
 Lets get up and moving
 Snozzberry
 I tried the other kind before and
really its not much
 Youve already used it at this point
really
 No
 Is it just seeing someone throw up or is
it also hearing the sound that makes it worse If
I just went  does that
 Okay
 Weve been traveling for years weve
been ambushed dozens of times
 No that was new and exciting
 We get there in the day
 I dont mind camping out
 One more time
 That was very impressive Thank you
 Ill drive if you want to switch out
later on
 All right I got it Nott I assume you
want to be in back
 Im into this
 I also do have a large tapestry thats
relatively clean if anyones feeling cold
 I can drive
 Lets not do that
 Seven
 I can desperately try and right the
stuff I suppose
 Im going to pull hard on the reins see
if I can get it out of the
 Oh are we stop stopped
 Okay Im stopping the whole thing
really quickly
 Ive got a hammer Ive got some rope I
dont know
 You dont know any Mending magic do
you
 Youre welcome Im sitting here
thinking if only we had a Mending cantrip of some kind
 I just had to say it out loud
 Im just going to sit on the wagon
looking bored
 Thats my thought
 We have a broken wheel anyway Were
not moving at a particular speed at the moment
 We are headed north
 Captain
 Goddamn it
 This cant possibly end poorly
 The Kiss army basically
 Thats the most insane roll Ive ever
seen
 Theres nothing thats being said here
that cant be said at full momentum
 We gave him saline
 This will do just perfectly Lets do
this
 Ill join
 Natural 
 Oneone thousand twoone thousand 
threeone thousand Is it getting closer
 Were going to get rained on
 Do we have anything We dont have
actual tents do we We dont have proper tents
 Im getting underneath the cart
 At least Ill definitely notice the
smell like fucking roses
 Pistachio or Rocky Road
 This is not my first time
 Yeah I miss having a proper tent and
the wagons were nice I miss that
 Something at least
 Theyre good luck
 Yeah tree struck by lightning very
good luck
 Its bad luck for normal people
 Everybody else
 Absolutely
 Dig it up

 I go over to take a look at it
 Or just out of waxed cloth
 Well if you come up with an ingredients
list well be happy to drum stuff up
 Talking about making shelter that
sounds great
 Like some sort of phantom manor is what
youre speaking of It would appear
 Doesnt have to be real to be interesting
 I like this plan Im into it
 Im going to before we take off take a
look at that tree that got hit I want to examine
how it was struck by lightning
 All right nature Three
 Is this practically like a little bowl
now or did it split
 Im going to drop a piece of silver in
the center so the next person who comes around and
examines this thing finds a piece of silver
 Id rather be cold than have bugs
 Yeah Its a very fair point
 Whos on a horse Am I on the cart or
am I on a horse
 Ill be in the cart then
 Im going to take one of the swords and
start using the flat of the blade to scrape the
wheel and give it an edge to start removing the
mud off of it and hop between wheels
 I think that sounded like a bird
talking
 What should we call back
 I dont see how thats any better
 Im going to gently light up one of my
swords
 Thats clever
 What
 Thatll do
 I have a thought I have a coin and
whoevers holding the coin has that for the day
Then we pass it around so you have this as a
chip
 Obviously we didnt do it this morning
but from now on
 Who wants it for tomorrow Or for next
for after the fight
 Its not close enough to really do
anything yet
 Uhhuh
 Yeah sure She probably did a little

 These happen to be made of metal
 Is it
 Yeah Sorry
 Im at least going to get up to Whats
a basic movement
 Am I within  feet of either of these
 Are we doing this Well were doing
this Im going to try and cast Enthrall on the
closest gator
 Wisdom save
 I havent attacked that one yet Oh
youre right Yes of course
 I dont think so
 Is eight my save on wisdom
 It says wisdom but I dont know
 No yeah its a racial ability
 Yep It aint going to eat It means
its going to pay attention to me and only me
 I know Im sitting Im spinning my
sword and talking in
 
 Yep
 Oh boy Dont fall
 Just a minute of pain
 You want to go first
 Thank you
 With my running speed how close can I
get and still have an action
 Thats as far as I can get without an
action
 At the very least then Im going to
 Yep Since I still have some distance
Im going to try some Vicious Mockery to see if
that does anything The one
 Im curious what thats going to sound
like Ill hit the Vicious Mockery on the one that
currently has Nott just because
 Yeah no 
  Crocodile Dundee
 Good man
 God damn it
 Blood Curse of the Eyeless amplified
 Disadvantage
 If you were just prone he would still
have it so if the spell is still active
 Yeah this is low level there wouldnt
really be much bringing you back
Thatd be the end of it
 Not three
 Wheres your book
 Ive got a theory
 What were you doing here What is this
place
 Im going to peruse these ruins a little
bit see what they are and what they look like
 Do you know where they are heading
 A word bird
 Where were going is a bit dangerous we
should warn you
 Hey Caleb you got a second
 Take a look at this Do these mean
anything to you Just looking at the stone
structures that are here
 I rolled an eight They are stone
 Thats disappointing I kick it
 Lets see if we can cut them and keep
some of this leather I bet its worth a little
bit of money
 Yeah well check the guts
 Choose your weapon
 Is there anything fun in the guts
 Hey you can get the note
 Lets haul this all back onto the cart
and get on our way and see where we get
 What do you propose we do
 Will she be welcomed anywhere
 All of this are great points but Im
waiting for another idea
 Its also possibly someone to watch the
cart while we do our businesses
 To see if we can find somewhere safe
 Yeah
 Well this is never going to get
irritating Lets get on our way
 Thats going to make it even better
 That cant happen We will not have
that
 Cling to our irony
 Seriously cheeky Cheekingly serious
 Lets head out
 Technically did we get a short rest on
the way in Or did that not happen
 I love this place This is great
 We have a beautiful piece of leather We
also have some fine tapestries We have a safe We
have many things
 That was me at  with every cop ever
that was great This is the tiniest hill and I
will die on it Never ended that well
 No
 Stunning
 That sounds exciting I think we need a
round
 I didnt know I needed this
 You are a shithole magnet really when
you think about it Thats fair
 Can we go shopping in town maybe Weve
got some leather to trade may have some armor
 Were also going to be looking for a
place to sleep I dont know if youd recommend
anywhere that
 You have rooms
 Thats exciting
 Im very excited by this
 How many rooms do you have
 How much are they apiece
 I figure we should stay in all four for a
couple of days
 Per person
 I am perfectly okay with this
 Eight silver
 Lets put a couple yeah eight thats
fine Ive got that
 Were we given anything special to say to
him or should we go wake him up
 Yeah Im going to walk over and sit
down at his table
 Wave my drink underneath his nose Hey
hey hey I pop it off
 Ill flick him in the forehead
 You seem like such a charming
gentleman
 You just seem like such a charming
gentleman
 We were sent for
 A certain gentleman
 I hand him the drink one more time
 Its sterile By its very nature its
sterile
 Dont fix him hes perfect
 Were here to help you with your
troubles
 Were here to deal with the safe house
 Well if you want another drink then
youre going to show us how to get there and how
to deal with it and what you know
  I take my drink back
 I want to point out this is entirely
your doing
 Ill give you 
 You said it
 Oh you know this one
is the sea

 Weve got some shopping to do weve got
to run around a bit
 I sleep naked Thank you
 Mmhmm
 Were putting our stuff down and were
also How late is it at this point
 Thats a terrible idea
 Are you going to rethread the silver
that is
 Thats fair
 Yep Some leather some armor Theres a
few things
 Like youve just kissed SpiderMan
 Its not that I dont trust this place
or like it but Im thinking about locking the
door a little more heavily than normal Im going
to wedge my sword underneath the door to make sure
that it cant open without moving the sword Its
a lot of new people today
 I dont like new people
 Im all right with this as well This is
fine Ill take the bed though if youre
offering
 Its going to become that story that
everyone hates
 Who wants the coin in the morning by
the way
 I think this is a clever system
 Yeah but in the morning somebody gets
it
 I love a fake American accent
 Definitely a long time since Ive dealt
with anyone in a dragon mask
 Thats a weird thing to put in the
middle of a swamp
 Of people in dragon masks
 Thank you Ive picked everything out
myself This is all put together
 Im literally covered in them
 Everybody Literally the coat is made
up of seven different options
 Yes But theres also yeah
 Yeah Im wearing a Platinum Dragon
necklace
you a worshipper of the Platinum Dragon by any chance
 Sure
somebody whos a worshipper of the Platinum
Dragon I guess I can trust you
 Thats what everybody says
 Remind me to show you my tapestries
 No its literally my tapestries
 Shes high on sugar Dont listen to
her Anyway
Tyrant
not a very nice goddess and the worshippers of her
are after this bowl and I need to stop them
getting it Theyre not good people
 Molly
 Thats somehow even creepier
 And right back in the pit Anyway
do what you need me to do I just really need to
get this item I need to make sure it
 Very gently and politely but yeah
 We ordered coffee Were still waiting
on coffee Is there going to be a desert Was
there a desert menu Can I get a container Eggs
never keep anyway
 Does it always do that
 Well done Thats a good joke
 Ill also go in the back
up if need be
 Just feathers in your face
 Wait just to be clear
 Your job your
only job was to walk to a building and back for
god knows how many years and you think were
going the right way
 Do you need to be drunk
 Now is not the time to start making
judgments sir
 Does that clear your memory
 Did you both roll
 Do we not get advantage
 I think the Mr was pretty respectable all
things considered
 Feel free to dive through the bag for
anything you need
 Just for fun  stay down
 Some days you cant get rid of a bomb
 Anything on the right
 Right
 Is there somebody on the left
 Whoa
 
 Well done
 Does this sound like some sort of ward
against the undead
 Ive got that
 Im going to pull out my sword and Im
going to carve into the side of the tree a big
sign that says Here Lies Salty Pete with an
arrow down straight below
 I dont know but it sounds like
something awful happened to him doesnt it
 Do you have a way of magically marking
this as well so we can have a bit of a compass
 Yeah like a point can you do a thing
where you can put a pin in this tree
 Thats true Never mind
 No thats not fair As long as we can
make our way back here again one way or the other
and I suppose thats true
 Yeah I think weve already had our fun
with the one
 No theres a lot happening over there
 The loneliest plant
 With that life delivers a pleasant
surprise
 Fighters move forward magic peoples
hang back
 Theater whisper
 Yeah
 Lets just pay attention and if it
starts getting close then well deal with it
Were just not going to let it escape Were just
going to keep an eye out for it
 Did you have your own mask or do they
just wear masks out of curiosity
out They kept me in the temple Its because they
were bad all right Im glad that Im not with
them anymore Theyre bad people
 I tend to find things that live in trees
filled with bones tend to not have necessarily many
friends Im just putting it out there I have
nothing else to base that off of but it didnt
look like a very social creature
 Can I see him from here
 Seven
 Do I technically have advantage because
its trying to perceive an undead creature
 Ill join you in the nonstealthing
 Youll be going in front of us Because
youre going to talk to him
 For now
 Nott why dont we check for traps
too
 This should be good
 Where did it happen inside Or where
did they come from
 But did they come from the house or
from outside the safe house or inside
of those in one question like Did you come from
this this or this maybe and then well know
where
 What if there isnt
 Thats fair
 Oh no Wait Come back
 Were going to loot the corpse anyway
We know where that moneys going
 Were going to go find it in the tree
later Itll be fine
 Its practically going to be in a safety
deposit box
 
 Its magic
 Im going to try and cast Enthrall
 I dont know Yes I believe its a
wisdom
 Yeah it is racial
 
 Yep
 Ill move up to that tree
 As a bonus Ill no Ill hold off
 It was a good plan
 The acid will do full damage
 You can dash and burn your action
 No without the strength modifier
 Its like in Willow with the stick
Woo
 Does the radiant damage seem to have a
particular effect
 All right
 Where is the little bird
 Theres really not much I can do here
so Im going to
 I got nothing I can do
 Well I can do that Im going to do one
more attempt to do a Devils Tongue
  Scoot scoot Scoot
 Oh wow holy cow Im not used to it
working thlevel so hey look at that it
actually has gone up d psychic damage Thats
four points of damage and it has disadvantage on
its next attack roll
 Brain freeze
 Thats all I got
 Glug glug
 Are there actual knives stuck in
 Shortswords or daggers
 Yeah were looting these bodies right
now Thats nice
 
 Roll a d
 Why dont we all head in that direction
maybe In a large well knit group
  One thing weve got it
coming
 Would have been used as a safe house for
awhile I imagine though
 Nott do you want to walk on top of the
water for a bit and keep an eye for anything
underneath the surface
 Well what if something grabs you from
the shore Like a troll
 Yes
calling her Nott and I just didnt get it
 We were drunk at the time it just sort
of happened
 Why dont you try pulling on the branch
that it was tied to
 The water is now crystal clear by the
way
 Pull on the branch that it was tied to
 What Where did that even go
 Oh
 Traps
 Do you want to throw some light in
here
 Yeah were in there as well
 Ill help with this one Smelling the
air for fishy Oh doesnt matter anyway
 Do you go back and forth
 Do we hear the slip and the whoosh
 Im going to point out we cant
retreat
 No
 Shes upstairs
  Ive already activated a sword
 
 Where am I Lets see Im over there
Im going to run as far as I can go towards Fjord
and then Im going to spend the rest of my action
running across and get into that little alcove
 No the other side of it Im so sorry
 So positioning and ready for things to
come
 Ive got nothing for my bonus
 One is activated the other is not
 Have anything good on a bonus
 Does that get advantage
 Arent they in combo wouldnt that be
sneak attack
 Hi
 After
 There aint nothing for me to hit so
Im going to slightly peek out around the corner
so that I can keep an eye on things and Im going
to hold my attack for anything that comes within range
 Yeah the circle should be a little
further forward so yeah theyre just
 Since hes going to end his turn there
 Im going to go ahead and cast some
bullshit on that
 This is a reaction Im doing a Blood
Maledict The next two attacks are disadvantage
 Yeah
 One point of damage
 Wait didnt he burn his whole turn just
getting to where he was
 What did you roll
 Are you close enough to the bonus
action Can someone grab Fjord or is that not
happening
 I did step out
 Hey were all friends here
 I cast Friends
just get really aggressive sometimes Im sorry
 I know That was intense Theres a lot
in that Are you going to be all right
certain things sometimes Dragon blood and all
Thank you for looking out for me
 Youre right Youre going to feel a
little weird in a few minutes I apologize for
that Its a thing Lets clear this water and
lets take a breather Lets sit down
 Thought you needed a minute of clarity
worse when I go like that so its fine You guys
didnt beat me up You didnt try and kill me
Its great You guys are nice Thank you
 This one less so
 I am keeping an eye on these pools
looking for any movement by the way
 Have you not played with your Gil die
yet
 The official currency of it Nice
manacles
 Are they humanoid sized
 How deep is that pool
 Im going to search the bottom of it
 Can she give me advantage on that
 I know We didnt want to interrupt the
thing
 It doesnt matter anyway its eight
 Check that other one too in a moment
 The other one then
 I think were going to have to
 Dont we have a cat that can become a
fish
 We dont know if theres going to be air
on the other side of that though so we need
people that can
 As long as you dont mind dying sure
 Were going to do this
 Well have a rope tied
 We are the worst people
 Im not okay with this
 We could even cast the thread and sleep
upstairs
 Sure
 Yeah sure
 I dont think it can be
impressive to do that but if we can destroy it
here then so be it
 Actually heres an insane thing that
occurred to me Technically speaking Charm Person
lasts a really long time I cast Friends
 Thats fair Im into that
 Mr Caleb
 Theres only so many burdens were
expected to bear before were asking for failure
 Oh no Im with you
  You were right Caleb Youre
just a shitty communicator
  Yep
 Ive never played with a magical item
before
 I owe you the biggest drink Oh my god
mean that thing was connected to the Scaled
Tyrant and the cultists If they find out what youve
done theyll come after you But I want you to
know Ill do whatever I can to stop them
 Oh the dragon one
 I say we sleep upstairs
 Pull the rope up that way well have
plenty of time if we hear them coming back up
 With the warning system well have
plenty of time to get away if theres too many of
them and theyll have no way up if we pull the
rope up
 People will keep watch
 That way well have an early warning
before they even manage to crawl their way up
 Kitten kebab
 Im going to activate one sword hold it
behind my back sit at the edge and wait to give
a swing See if anything is going to pop up
 Just a standard attack or standard and
bonus
 Two strikes or one strike
 Thats awful 
 And an eight
 Someone hit something Yay
 Im staying on guard in case anything
else comes through
 Instead of putting another wire down
there you could leave Frumpkin down there and he
can alert us if theres any problem
 If we hear anything were going to
charge down there Theyll be fine
 Mention that they should clean up the
bodies
 This I can confirm
 On the way down I smack Caleb a bit on
head down
 Amvivious
 Are you going to be all right with Caleb
going without you
 Were going to be one down then
 Is that the sound of Pass Without a
Trace
 Like Ed Wynn getting tickled
 Oh my
 Super fast in the water I bet theyre
really fast in the water
 But probably not as fast as they are
 Im of the opinion that the problem with
this bottleneck is we dont know what they are
doing on the other side It would be easier to
assess whats coming and make sure that they
cant if we take care of everything there then
we can assess whats there and they cant prepare
or get more together Have time to
 I feel like over there is the way to
go
 Well stay together in a group
 Ill leave my coat here Im not
dragging that into the water
 Thats a very nice sling thing Itd be
a shame if anything happened to it Are you sure
youre not coming
 One quick attack or do we try and take
them out quietly I assume well well take a
look at what it is
 If they dont see us then we get the
sneak attack And if they do
 Well see what we see
 
 I am so excited
 I didnt think Id enjoy this quite so
soon
 Do we want to try and do a clockwise
attack Knock them out as we go
 Seven
 Molly Caleb
 Marshmallow in the center
 Oh my god
 And then it was like
 nope
 I feel your pain
 Okay Im going to run Im going to use
my bonus action to activate one of my swords
 Technically that would have still been
activated so shit thats right Yeah Im going
to use my bonus action to activate the other one
too Im going to see if I can make it to that
little hill over there
 Im going to attack the one thats right
in front of Fjord
 Yes so Im going to do two attacks plus
a hasted attack Thats  That hits one does
not and then my third attack is a  that also
hits
 Thats eight points of damage
 And nine points of damage
 I am using the ds
 Thats the end of my turn
 That was three attacks one missed
 She rolled a natural  for her other
roll
 Murder it
 Wait no its a saving throw right
 Oh its a dex saving throw Never mind
sorry
 That makes me sad
 That hits
 
 That is with the plus two Im an AC of
 I am easy target
 The other person Im casting Curse of
the Eyeless on the second
 That does not hit
 Curse of the Eyeless
 And I take my three points of damage
 With disadvantage
 Okay that hits
 The Eyeless
 I am yelling
 Fjord I am going to take
a swing at the one thats looking a little rough
I believe its that one yeah Oh my fucking god

 
 Nine points of damage
 Still standing
 Ill swing again 
 Ten points of damage
 Im literally just a windmill at this
point
 Then spinning around I go right to face
the other one and Im going to take my last attack
against it
 Nope I dont even know why Im
bothering
 You fucking arsehole
 Oh god that looked like a one for a
moment Sevens are scary No it was a seven I
 Yeah you did youre right
 Nah
 I dont even know why I bother
 Shite
 Yeah I suppose were doing yeah
 Running to the Yasha creature
 Im going to run through the water
Speeds doubled
 That doesnt matter then
 Actually heres an interesting thing
is oh god yeah I dont want to be in the
water so Im going to stay on that little patch
of land so I dont get
 All right first two rounds Thats a 
and a natural 
 So the natural  is double the dice
 All right Eh Thats nine And the
other one is 
 Third and fourth Thats one of them
misses but the other ones  the other one
hits the other one is ten
 Thats better  points of damage
 Im going to use my bonus action
 Oh I did for the attack Never mind
Never mind Thats literally everything I can do
 So irritating
 Two Two hit points Thats two kittens
man
 Oh god does that mean I oh shit Im
out for a round arent I
 Im pleased
 Holy cow
 Im going to  and throw up
for a second because I got vertigo because I lost
Haste And thats my turn
 Can you move while youre not blinked
by the way
 Yeah there was a whoa there We will
all get yelled at on the internet if were wrong
 Yes I do
 Is it possible to make a leap across 
some of water at the very least to try and get
back to land
 Thats a ten
 Im going to also then use my action to
dash
 And Im within range
 Im going to use my bonus action
 Okay thats fine Wait Double check
because I thought thats just using my offhand
 Thats okay Ive got options Sort of
 Okay Thats fine Im going to try
something weird hold on Since thats not going
to work can I take Enthrall Im going to take
Enthrall Im going to try and use Enthrall
 Yeah thats true Im trying to see
 It might be it Yeah its an action
never mind Vicious Mockery
 Oh my god everything is an action I
have no bonus actions or anything reasonable that
I can do
 Im in melee Thats fine
 That alone
 Very shallow Really hot Instagram
account though
 Take ten feet to the right I cant
 Well it depends where the cube goes
 If he wants to escape hes got to knock
us all back
 Its going to be the two of us I think
Yeah thats my money
 So it gets an attack of opportunity
from
 Ill join you
 Oh wow
 Oh god no
 Is the staff that the
 We grabbed it before it sank
 Ill take a look in there Ill walk
towards the pool at the very least Im going to
pick up any of the Moonweaver pieces
 Im not entirely sure but theyre very
very nice
 Also 
 It looks like a door
 His symbol is a door
 I would say so
 What do I find for the Moonweaver
 You did check for traps right
 Im going to sit back and watch
 Again
 That looks very exciting Im going to
run over
 Yeah nope no Im pushing aside Im
going to try the weight
 Perhaps
 I give it a swing
 Its worth more as it is
 In general
 Is there one more box we havent
opened
 You should check for traps and open it
 In theory weve moved it aside
 Oh lets put that in the pile
 Lets put that in the pile too
 Roll initiative
 It was in a case so I suppose it would
be unlikely Or if it was on its way somewhere
it was probably on the way to the other end of it
 Mr Caleb
  Youre going to get
yours oh yes
 Ill be living the dream
 Yeah check to see if theres a scar or
anything
 Roll for initiative
 Im going to walk up and take a look at
this pool one more time I want to taste the
water is it fresh or salt
 Its sea water
 Why were they bringing religious
iconography to this thing What were they trying
to do with it
 Im going to push his head underneath
the water
 Anything
 Tap three times when youre done Push
him under
 Were even for the teleport now
 Of course its possible it hasnt
actually had an effect on you yet either
 That doesnt make any sense
 Is this about whales
 This place is definitely making me
nervous We should do our best to cut off this
particular flowthrough
 I think they were trying to activate it
They were trying to please it
 Lets leave it exactly where theyre
supposed to be so we did our job
 Were working for the smugglers Well
put it back in the safe house
 You know yeah
 He wants to do this See if it does
anything Thats fair
 If its possible I would love to cave
this thing in
 I dont think theyre going to come up
once were out of here Theyd have to dig through
 Mind like a steel trap
 I dont have any
 No I dont have any
 We did
 We did check them
 Theres lots you can do with manacles
 And to rifle through their pockets I
imagine
 You want swamp things This is how you
get swamp things
 Been a while
 Were done were heading out
 That was a great roll
 Well like so many good things we can
do it back when we get to the hotel
 You can sneak up take a look rob it
and then throw a stick of dynamite in just
because if were going to be those people What
happens if hes actually there
 Yeah I feel like thats pretty obvious
at this point
 I just like having a game plan
 Then we should rob it first
 Therell be a body curing if it is his
house Well know because therell be a body
curing and getting nice and ripe
 I feel that as well
 Well give you the dynamite and if
anything seems like it goes wrong you can
immediately signal Caleb and well bring the
cavalry in
 Ill go behind Yasha
 Thats not bad
 Do we recognize these vines and what
kind of plant this is
 Well see how this goes No
 Ive got a weird idea
 Everybody back up a bit Im going to
take a little bit of my jerky Im going to wrap
it around a ball bearing make a little baseball
out of it Im going to chuck it right into the
middle of the vines
 I love camping
 Thats entirely possible
 We remember what not to do right which
is
 Youre going to take everything that you
can grab in there
 And then blow it up and run
 But its only up to  feet away from
her
 You have full running speed though
 Im going to get behind that tree and
activate my swords
 Oh dear
 That was a bottle rocket
 Hes harder to hit from a distance at
the moment
 
 Im going to come out from behind my
tree right there just a little bit so I can see
him Im going to try and Enthrall him because I
dont have any good stuff that I can do from a
distance
 Is it charismabased Thats right
 Because it says wisdom I get so
 It does not succeed
 It does succeed
 Im actually going to sort of stand out
in the Im going to move a couple feet out
you fucker you got We got more than that Where
we Come on Bring it I dont know what Im
doing Too much caffeine
 That all happened in there That all
happened
 Good thing nobody in the world saw
that
 But you can save against that right
Every turn
 Are we seeing sprays when he gets hit by
these things by the way
 How far can I move in one
 Okay Im going to head in the direction
of this creature Im going to stay about
Actually lets try something ridiculous You took
a lot of damage from that spray right
 Thisll be fun Lets run up to it see
how close I can get
 Im going to try to leap at that just
north of me to see if I can get over here then
By that spiritual weapon If I can leap there
 Thats fine At least itll hopefully
give everybody some flanking
 Thats a four
 Thats as far as I can move
 Im going to hold my action in case he
comes within fighting distance
 Yeah Im holding my attack
 Can I do anything with my bonus I cant
do anything with my bonus
 Yeah I think that ends my turn
 Youre just going to take damage
 We healed up We got a long rest
 There is a tiny burning fire there now
 It would have been
 Theres a lot of threes in this game
right now
 Does it get close enough for me to take
a swing
 Swing swing I just get two attacks
right
 Actually Im going to use the good
sword It doesnt matter Thats awful and thats
pretty good Thats  that misses and  that
hits
 Thats d plus d d now thats
right Thats not bad Thats ten points of
damage
 I will take my reaction  points of
damage
 Thats fine This is what Im good for
Im taking it
  gold Natural 

 New die
 Does the fact that Im using what effect
I have
 So its d plus a little
 Ooh That pretty much does the same
thing   points of damage
 Hes also going to of course Curse of
the Eyeless
 Oh that was my reaction Never mind
 Thats all right
 Nobody else hit it
 Im going to walk up and Im going to
flank it so I get advantage
 Im going to take a hit Thats 
 Thats nine points of damage
 I want to get the new sword push let
it bend and pop into it
 Ive got a bonus action Im going to
give him an autocure just in case
 The snake tattoo on my hand the eye on
the back of my hand bursts and blood comes
pouring out of it I take two points of damage
 I didnt need the amplify Oh actually
thats right I dont have to take damage for
that never mind
 Ive never done that before That
 Just to be sure Im going to dig around
and make sure this is true death on this thing and
its not going to start regenerating or anything
Does it look like its regenerating at all
 
 Dont poke it
 Okay lets like Im going to gently
 I feel like I should have had a Oh
well thats fine
 Ah Six seconds can go quick
 No Fjord
 So now we have our full turn and it
cant react so hold the I can move Ill be
fine We all get a full turn before anything
happens
 Wait one second
 Hold until were clear
 I obviously cant hit it so
 I mean
 Im going to get his attention peace
out Im going to Misty Step
 I can go  feet
 Yep yep
 Im going to head to the shinies Im
going to Misty Step next to yeah there we are
 I just need visual and just no
theres nothing I can do
 He has no reaction
 Oh yeah weve got to wake him up now
Cause hes almost dead
 Yes
 No Im not going to do that
 What are you going to do with that You
dont want that
 Im going to go through the skulls Do
you want to join me going through the skulls right now
 Lets not crowd the boy
 Ten
 Theres no sense repeating
 Especially since were now a 
gold richer
 I guess get it out of your system then
thats fine
 Are you done yet
 Unless youre really out of anything to
eat Then I suppose you know desperate times
 Its just getting awkward
 Did you just say bougie Ugh God never
mind I dont like you again
 Its a word that people use when they
want to sound ostentatious about how ostentatious
something is
 Its collect when we get back
 And his agent is dead His person out
here is dead
 Or trying to send an email How does
this work All caps
 Just ruin everything there we are
 Except of course that theyre making
ready for war
 So thirsty
 Where would we sell such a thing like
this
 Is that an apothecary Do you have an
apothecary here
 My god I miss shopping Im going to
give him three gold for his trouble Youre
brilliant And Im heading in that direction
 Its quaint and rustic shut up
 What kind of font is it written in
 I go to knock
 Youre not buying today
 Already What time do you open
tomorrow
 Are you sure you dont want to perhaps
buy a fresh troll heart
 Very wet
 Not a bad die there
 We found a troll and we killed it
 Let him prod Its fine
 Or could we also talk about trade
possibly if you have some interesting stuff
 If youve got stuff to trade You seem
like a clever fellow Im sure you got something
around here thats interesting and unique
 Well see what you put together and
well definitely talk about what this is worth in
the morning And if you have anything unusual that
you put together if you have a signature blend of
any kind Im always interested in people who are
excited to experiment
 Yes
 That too
 Well see you bright and early
 Do you think it would be better to leave
this here so he can contain it
 I mean we killed a troll its not like
we cant kill him if it goes wrong
 Why must you sully everything good and
pure in this world Sam
 This is where all those manacles have
been coming from Oh no
 Perfect well be back in the morning
Lets go take a rest
 I really liked him
 Whatever you think that we shouldnt
leave town without trying
 You got it
 To be fair hes saved our lives dozens of
times
 All gone All dead
 Any surprise you have
 You cant drink in real life and you
still wont drink on graph paper
 Ive got cards Im going to play and
Im going to drink And weve got to discuss
whats happening tomorrow
 Can I see the cover when she grabs the
book
 Yeah Im ready
 Well do that on the way out as soon as
we put the cart together
 Weve done what we needed This is a one
troll town I think Not a great time to be had here
 They may not give them to us unless hes
there
 I missed this
 Oh why not Another round please And
Ill put a gold for everyone down
 No
 Im finishing this and Ill be right
up
 I go last
 I leave two gold on the counter before I
leave For you no matter what but if you tell me
what it is I promise I wont tell the rest of
them I just want to lord it over them
 Enjoy your evening Cheers And I head
upstairs
 For the record I tell none of you
 Three of those tweets will be from me
 Oh yes please
 This seems like a bad idea Sure
 Does it look like anything Does it
remind me of a mystic symbol of any kind
 Just an arcana check Lets see what
happens Natural 
 Im back baby
 What happened to you on that boat
 Something might have followed you
 Youre going to forgive me for this
later I cast Friends
 Actually Im so sorry not Friends
its Charm Person
 Im so sorry its Charm Person
 Thank you
 Theres something in you that you either
dont want to talk about or dont remember
properly I think
 No I dont think I couldve
 I know
 Which is why I didnt ask
 I trust that youll tell me everything
you know but Im not sure you even know
everything you know
 I dont think it matters where the sword
is at all
 Perhaps I think may I
 Something from the deep is in that I
dont know It reminds me of something
 Ill keep an eye and no matter what
keeping each other safe its what we do Its
what you do when you got a group of people
 Well keep you safe
 Ill probably be up for an hour then
Ill turn in
 Lets go to the shop everybody Anybody
wants to go shopping can go shopping Anybody else
wants to wrangle up the cart
 We need a valet ticket
 As much as Im kind of into this
 Why dont you all meet us at the get
the cart and youll meet us at the apothecary
 Meet us at the apothecary
 Ive been thinking about that
 In front of you
 But we have a map and maybe she can show
us on the map where she thinks she needs to go
 No I didnt say that I said if we know
which direction she needs to head we can figure
out possibly if we can get her there
 No one should live here
 She does drink a lot and occasionally
seem interested in eating human flesh Im not
entirely well thats a subject for another
day
 Birds You know theres a bird in a
bonnet and another one smoking a pipe Thats all
I really  Just think about that Yeah
 If we knew the name of everything we put
down our gullet there would be no fun ever any
time Im very excited
 Im all right with this
 Im into it yeah
 So if we were to take that  and
possibly spend it on something in this shop is
there anything that we should take a look at
 Im curious about the sleeping thing you
have and again anything youre particularly
proud of
 Im always excited for a surprise
 Ill take some sleep aids and whatever
helps you sleep Some sleepy tea or whatever
Anything like that
 You buy your own issue Whatever youve
got a problem with you can buy it yourself This
is not where my coin is going And anything that
smells nice just whatever
 How much for the whole deal
 Can you do change One gold
 Thank you

 Im aware Im ignoring it
 Im fine Im going to put it in my
additional notes right now
 All right
 All right What are you going to do with
that heart anyway
 Thats a seven
 Is everything relatively all right on
the cart Doesnt look like its been
 I trust you Its the only way to be
sure
 We have some weights to put down
 But there seems to be the crossroads up
there There seems to be a path through the
forest
 I think we go Rexxentrum just because
theres an army marching that direction
 I dont believe youve ever heard a
crazy story about anything happening anywhere
 Im challenging you for details
 Whats the Traveler doing up there
 Could someone keep their eyes on the
road as were moving forward
 You have died of dysentery
 At some point we want to pull out the
map and show it to Kiri and see if she can point
to anything on the map
 Do you want advantage
 Individually 
 Have you ever actually tried rubbing his
ankles when he says that
 Some tents would be a great idea
 I generally dont actually care about
the theme of any city that Im in because Ive
never bothered to learn Does any of this look
familiar before Do I recognize any of these
people
 I think were going to need some general
goods Ive got some ideas of some stuff we could
use on the road
 We should have some tents
 I want to hit the general store
 Actually I am How fascinating that you
caught me right in the moment where Im ready to
spend money
 Well Ive got a couple problems
 Ive got a cart that keeps breaking down
on me
 If youve got a kit for something like
that Also I was thinking about maybe putting
some canvas on top of it giving it a little bit
of safety from the elements I think Im going to
need at least four tents Ive recently come into
a bunch of new companions and they really didnt
have whats necessary to make our way through
these wonderful wonderful roads
 Fourll do it
 Actually Ill get five tents
 Thats perfect
 You wouldnt happen to have any raw
canvas I could use to possibly put a bit of a pup tent
 Ill take the repair kit
 And however much basic supplies to put
this together and Ill figure out how handy I am
on the road
 Will that do
 Hmm Im used to yards
 If nothing goes wrong it should work
Is it waxed and reasonable
 All right well just have to make a
little
 Were trying to do a covered wagon
 So were at  gold now
  gold All right weve got the tents
weve got the canvas and then just a little bit
of lumber to put this whole thing together and
that ought to do it
 Yeah covered wagonworth
 Do you have bamboo Whatever you have
 All right at the very least we can fake
something for now Thats fair Whats my total
right now
 I could do 
 Thats a nine Thats nice
 Cant argue  gold
 Two I got two One more and I get a
free sandwich Is that  total
 That was a savage burn Ugh
 Or really itchy wool
 I think were probably fine
 Were killing it
 Were basically gods
 Weve got tents
  How
 When have you ever met a Chent
 Cant handle
 Natural one
 Oh yeah that hits
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa
 Hows new management working out
 Now now Is that apology accepted at
this point
 Im going to put this out here that we
just received an apology This sort of behavior
should be rewarded
 We appreciate the courtesy
 Its rough out here they should take
their crossbows
 That is very fair lets take a look
 I feel bad Ive got to admit No I
have to deal with this Im going to walk to my
cart Im going to pull out that armor that I got
at the orcs place Im handing it to the kid
 Youre going to get shot at again Its
breaking my heart
 Thank you for recognizing and for being
gracious about our previous deal I appreciate
someone who stands up and holds to their word
Thats really nice and that should be rewarded in
this world
 Well I wasnt really holding them to
that one
 Respect management
 So true
 Oh god why
 Its not technically a corpse yet
 Hell only find better people
 That went well
 Theres nothing better than waking up in
the morning with no pants and flowers in your hair
 I add a drop of lavender oil and I think
were done
 And this is why you buy the lavender
oil
 So we can remove it and attach it to
ours
 Is theirs better than ours
 Its all about the dysentery
 The Volvo of wagons
 
 I like it
 I like a good waterfall
 Id like sleep somewhere comfortable
 Idleworks Shelf
 Pink hearts yellow moons
 Blue diamonds
 Therell probably be something siding
closer to the waterfall maybe
 Does that seems safe to you
 Looking for lodgings for the night
 I dont need that ride
 Travelers passing through to somewhere
else
 We need to find a place to store our
stuff and hopefully find an inn for the night first
 Private contractors
 Drinks is a great idea
 Have we seen another tiefling since
hitting the city
 Wait for it
 Youve brought us to Florida
 Lets go get out stuff somewhere
 Ill follow
 Probably inevitably
 Definitely going to need a drink for
this
 Lets get some rooms and stow our stuff
and get out there
 Yeah
 Whichever one we catch the eye of
first
 All right Im in
 Oh this is going to be funny
 Want to go at the same time
 Three two one Six
 
 I just put down four gold pieces
 Youre in a tourist town things are
going to cost something
 Amaze me baffle me make me forget
where I am
 Bless you Youre colorful yourself I
love everything youre wearing
 Bless you Ill happily pay for hers as
well because I want to drink her under the fucking table
 What happens later tonight Other than
more drink
 Are we that obvious
 Brava
 I dip a finger
 Shoot or sip
 I am paying for you I just put a gold
down Keep the tip as well
 Challenge accepted 
 Wow Okay
 Shes turning on the charm
 Oh are we talking about that Im not
going to invade your space if you dont need it
dont worry about it
 And if you drink enough you wont
remember either way
 No thats entirely something you can
do Its more common than youd think
 There was some pub I dont remember
what town I was in but I do remember the pub
because it was actually called the Swinging
Chandelier I dont remember what town it was
though But it was a great pub It had the best
chandelier
 Im going to walk right into the middle
of this Gentle persons are you harassing our
employee right now
 We have employed the services of this
person right here and I would agree that you
should probably leave right now and get another
table for yourselves
 Nope thats a four
 
 If you want to go too at the same
time I say a little bit of Infernal and Im
going to use a blood maledict and make him go
blind for a second
 The one on the left for me
 Thank you I was hoping for it
 Some people cant hold their liquor
Its really embarrassing
 I like the way that worked out
 Both equally mysterious
 Oh so its the Noise Room heavy bass
thudding
 I toss two at the same time
 Yeah Im into it Especially if it
fails please
 Yeah
 Im very excited to find out
 Want to do a little runaround
 I think were going to do that
 Because Hupperdook
 Its family friendly
 Did they
 I have done some ridiculous things in my
life that might take the top of it though
 Ive got an idea Ive got an idea
There is one member of our party who is probably
not going to want to go out and see this
ridiculousness
 Yasha I know youre not into this I
know that you want to have a night out Do you
just want to sit and keep the young one out of
trouble
 Its going to be fine Thats a joke
 Only one way to find out
 Ill bring you back something Yash
 Hes never going to dance again
 You can dance if you want to
 Were going outside to see what this
place has to offer before its time for a drinking
contest that well
  Onward and outward

time

 Oh god
 How is your hangover Whatever team your
on Im not sure I play for that one Its Team
fuck off Im well aware How are your hangovers
normally
 I got a weird thought This may feel
weird Im going to try my blood maledict
 Im going to do the Purgation advanced
to see if I can cure a hangover with it I dont
know if it will work Technically its a poison
and Im willing to drop some HP into this It gets
a little fancy and its mostly to see if I can
clean it up a little bit Maybe itll work maybe it wont
 Oh yeah I want to see if it works
 I feel like this could be very useful
Im going to work on this
 I wouldnt touch that
 Thank you for being part of my little
experiment
 I was just curious if I could pull
liquor out of people Im going to go throw up on
Fjord excuse me
 Im going to find Fjord and make sure
that however I throw up it makes it so it looks
like he did it to himself

 Oh god no I bring him back in
 Fuck off
 Thats a lot of money
 I say we start the spell now in case
they decide to throw away the coin purses Unless
somebody knows something that was in their purse
that was of actually of value that they could
recognize I need some bacon Does anyone have
money for bacon
 Lets try not to escalate anything too
quickly yet
 Do I have masculine wiles
 Im into it Ill take it
 Why dont we save that for the moment
that we have somebody we definitely want to
interrogate instead of somebody who might tell us
they dont know anything
 And get breakfast
 If it was Rissa what is she still doing
here
 Lets get some breakfast before
anything happens
 It was strung up
 Im sitting down to breakfast
 But if you were going to suspect
somebody who would it be
 Not with me
 I dont understand what youre trying to
imply here
 This might be a goblin thing
 Did those two gentlemen come back into
the bar at any point
 I mean at the very least thatll be
fun
 Everybodys my type Im really pretty
easy
 Whoever took our purses has our drink
tokens too
 Im just saying that if drink tokens
come back to the bar
 But somebodys got them
 I would keep it though
 Anytime Ive stolen something I
couldnt use later Ive always kept it for
sentimental reasons Im not sure why
 I dont steal anymore Much
Sometimes
 He had to flip a page for that one It
was exciting
 Yeah she said they lived by her pops
place
 I wanted to meet Pops anyway He sounds
interesting
 We feel that
 Well go to your fathers place first I
think well maybe if were in the mood pop into
their place while theyre not home perhaps
 Were going to put you on a cart and
were going to take the cart
 Will we walk faster than the cart will
go
 Really All right
 How close are we to the other houses at
this point To the boys
 I was excited to see what sort of
stuff
 Whats the thing youre most proud of
 Oh absolutely
 What happened to the other 
 At the moment
 That was what I was hoping for and it
happened
 Not yet
 Were here to talk to those two
 In the least
 I like that it was not even a question
 Not yet
 Now
 We hate to bother you also but we did
actually get robbed and if you have any idea
where we should start looking to actually
 I like weird folks
 Bless you
 Scissors
 We can keep asking has anyone had 
anything purchased
 With dicks on it
 How long have you been pickpocketing
then
 Mostly success at this point
 Well this is good This is a very
valuable lesson If you ever come across a purse
like this again you just take a tiny bit of it
and then leave the rest
 Well then you just bring it back
immediately Obviously you take five percent
 How soft are you getting
 If Ive learned anything you dont work
with animals or children and were rapidly
getting both
 I see no problem with that
 Lets make no promises but again
 You are so soft
 Oh please
 I tend to find these sorts of jobs
asking for a threeday extension does not go well
Youre given the time you do the job you finish
it you dont ask questions you dont ask for special
 Thats what Im talking about When
youre in a circus sometimes you get paid to do
gigs Things have happened Ive run a couple
things in my time
 Im into it
 Were a circus Of course weve robbed
people My god we have robbed swindled weve
been robbed weve gone back and found the people
whove robbed them sometimes we dont Oh my god yes
 Youre asking if my cards are bullshit
My cards are not bullshit
 I know you do But you wont say it
 Weve got a day or two to spend on this
but not a week
 Didnt you almost open fire on these
children not more than  seconds ago
 Of course you would
 This is why I dont miss the circus
 Im not saying no Im just saying
remember that we are hired hands
 Ive done dumber shit
 Have you ever eaten an orphan
 Say no more Im in
 That sounds like a terrible idea
 Im also in it for a crossbow
 Just remember you either get the
nickname The Gentleman because you are one or
because youre really not
 Im gonna give them nope never mind
Im not going to give them that because that
would be a terrible idea
 Ive got a good idea Im going to give
the older one one of my rings Ive got these
strange little rings that I left over Keep that
on you sell it if you have to but see if you can
hold off for a while If things go wrong get
within  feet of the Blushing Tavern hide and
wait and well find you
 Hide
 Its a finger ring
 It was one of the rings that we found in
the cave
 She said it
 Oh So weird
 That was a good one
 If we see those teenagers also we
should probably call them off
 At the very least we can leave word
with their employer and if we run into them well
call them off
 Well have Rissa meet us at the prison
maybe later She can call them off and we can head
to the prison
  Yeah that sounds great
 Never mind  Yep Well
Great Yep
 I dont know anymore Who wants the
node by the way
 Fair
 Lets go take a look at this prison
 Theyre literally on a mission to find
the kids right now
 Technically go back to work can be
one word if you say it fast enough
 Grammar
 Very Lord of the Rings
 Not very Lord of the Rings
 And it looks like a big factory that
looks like a evil Willy Wonka factory kind of thing
 What do you know about that machine he
built anyway
 Come across a couple
 Vampire Hunters Sorry
 Is it steampowered Or is it
 Its a magical power source then
 Maybe
 They just let it theyve cornered it
into a
 Honestly we could just show up and say
weve been hired to try and take care of it and go in
 We technically have been hired to go in
and take care of it Were just working in trade
 No they know not by the city so by a
private contractor
 I think were going to have to do a
little more research but Im feeling pretty good
about our prospects
 We heard you have a bug problem Were
here to take care of it
 I mean I suggest we wear shoes and
pants but you know
 We could have a letter from your father
perhaps
 Yeah but theyd be perfectly happy if
we Were going in knowing full well what were
getting into Theres no harm no foul there
 Okay You really want to break into a
prison
 I feel like we can make that dream come
true
 Youre so lucky shes not watching right
now
 Shes probably watching Hi Laura I
would love to see if theres any
sort of sketch or blueprint of this thing that we
could just take a look at first and maybe have a
thought of our plan of attack
 No I mean of the machine
 Just to sort of see what were getting
into
 We can go on our own if you like
 I mean I like pies but Im a bad
example of so many things
 
 This brings me back to some home games
 Yes we have our money back
 Yeah no Thats a good thought
 Were going to take a stab at this death
machine We were curious if you could
 I like the description
 If theres any information you can give
us about the machine just so that were not going
in cold like if you know if it has any
vulnerabilities to anything
 If you can sketch it for us so we can
get a sense of
 Please dont tell me that youre going
to do that
 Okay but Im not going to be able
to make heads or tails of any of this shit
 Eight
 Does anybody understand Gnomish
 Its very hard to get a spell in there
 We start pulling plates off
  start cutting our way through one
specific spot we could eventually get to a point
where you could get some spells in there
 You may have to tank this
 Is there a front and back to this thing
or is it just a whirling dervish
 It could possibly be blinded by
obscuring the lens
 Not you in per se but if we show up as
representatives here to dismantle the machine
 And you hired us to go in and do some
work
 Whatever works
 We should get some honey or something I
bet some honey on the lens would be a real pain in
the ass
 Do you have any honey
 Of course you do
 What do you have
 Why do you have molasses This is
suddenly very exciting
 Is this why your skin is so smooth
Youve been giving yourself a facial every night
 Magic molasses
 I was thinking if we had a small glass
jar of it we could give it a throw
 It could help it depends on how strong
the clockwork is
 Bubble gum
 And we do have some friends over there
that we just sent their young interns away on a
 In a very gentle bucket or pot
 It doesnt have to be hot It just has
to be
 Has to be a little hot
 Theres so many walls being broken
Theres like fourth wall fifth wall sixth wall
Its too deep
 Were in the eleventh dimension now
This is getting a little heavy
 Can I remove that
 How about just a huddle up Huddle up
lets just
 No we can put him in the center
 I mean it could be warm
 We are professional robot dismantlers
 Well were going to stop and pick up
some tar on the way there and I nominate the
human to talk
 Ill keep an eye on the guard not on the
guard Ill keep an eye on the worker
 Yeah yeah
 We could do that thing Do you remember
the vaulty thing Lets do the vaulting thing All
right youre going to do the thing over the
vault up
 If you get near the fence Im going to
try and jump on top of the fence
 All right were going to need the

 Im going to jump on top of the fence
 No Im just going to do the

 Yeah like the razzle dazzle
 Yep
 Oof ten
 Can I try and push up into a handstand
 All right
 Yeah natural  Oh no disadvantage

 Up and flipping back up and Im going
get the swords out Im going to start slowly
working on moving down the fence with both swords
doing a spin and trying to actually get a little
flip going A little acrobatic
 Ill need you spotting cause Im not
great at this
 Im going to jump onto your shoulders
now So I take a jump and try and land on the
shoulders Straight acrobatics
 All right You go away Im trying you
Thats a natural 
 Sorry you had a great fence and were
working on an act
 Its true
 Thats nine
 We should be at separate ends of the
fence right now because I made my way down the
fence with Yasha
 A lovely fence it is
 Then we dont have to put it in Well
just carry it
 Well carry it
 Were going in to kill a robot Its
fine
 What else do you bring into a  What do
they think were going to do with a bucket of tar
 Lets lean into it
 Poppin Drok I wont I wont speak
Im not going to speak
 I feel that
 Beau
 I tap Beau on the back and make her bow
a little bit
 Pull her back up
 To be fair we are
 Oh of course That makes perfect sense
and of course a man of your stature would be smart
enough to know that such a thing is true We
honestly we will admit we may have a favor a
very minor favor to ask if everything goes well
and we do in fact survive this encounter In
return also we will be gathering very valuable
data on how to defeat these sort of automatons
which will be put into your possession and would
definitely help you deliver something that could
help with the war effort This sort of data could
get back to the people in charge and help them
defeat machines in the future Were trying new
techniques new ways to defeat these sort of automatons
 I think you could go far Wed be happy
to help
 We may discuss perhaps if we can
help we have two friends who are currently in
your system and we would be more than happy to
discuss a means of maybe resolving their issue
with you Not innocence but just coming to a
conclusion that is mutually agreeable
 Man I love bullshitting
 Persuasion God please for once in
your miserable life Oh man eight
 I know
 Hardly waste your time
 Of course we are Anyone want the node
 Or Caleb Well whos going to be
throwing 
 Well heat it up Caleb will heat it up
youll throw it in and then Ill be using some
ice to try and cool the thing down once its in
there
 Once it starts opening up the armor
well just go to that one particular plate and
start ripping a hole in it
 Chopping the plates off
 Well get through doors set the node
set everything we need into action
 What kind of feet does it have again
 Ball bearings
 Well see Slow it down I dont know
well find out
 Tank this and youll be all right Its
just swords
 Fjord you got a plan Jester
 No we took a long rest
 It should
 Do we want her to have anything
precast I dont think Duplicity will matter but
maybe a Spiritual Weapon already called up
 Just have it already Lets
 Oh then lets wait then All right
 Youre welcome to try
 Certainly not me
 I mean if we die does it matter
 We can talk to the guards on the way
out
 Yeah but were going to be in the
prison when were done
 Thats fair
  Assuming we live
 Mr Schuster you look terrible I yell
very loud to see if anybody responds to the name
 Mr Schuster
 Oh thats a 
 Worth a shot
 Whens the last time you opened it
 Until we knock on the door I imagine
 Lets heat up the tar
 Ill hold it since youre doing the
thing
 I also have immunity to flame so or
not quite immunity but I dont really mind flame
 Well probably need some light in here
too
 Excellent
 I turn to one of the guards Is there
any light in there or are we going to need to
bring our own
 Fantasmagoria Im definitely having
some yeah
 Actually its got eyes and not ears I
dont think When we saw the blueprints was there
any way for it to detect sound or was it all
visual
 All right
 Lets pretend were whispering
 We can do that Lets cast Pass Without
a Trace Im going to light up my sword
 That would be our last ndlevel spell
Wait lets
 Maybe not Pass Without a Trace because
once it sees us it doesnt matter anymore
So lets not do that yet
 Im going to light up my swords
 Yeah with ice
 That brings me down to  hit points so
thats fun Wow thatll be a lot of fun Thats
thrilling Theres a door over there Do you want
to sneak over and see
 Can we put some light in there and maybe
take a look at whats in there
 Yeah Since we have an orb up dont we
No we have a torch
 Caleb you want to use the torch to take
a look in there maybe Im keeping an eye through
this hallway and I think Im going to slowly start
scooting
 But against the wall
 Thank you
 We can all get in that room if we have
to
 Thats the hope but we have these other
options over here Is there anything I can see
from my perspective from where Im standing right
now
 I knew youd say that Thats a 
 Do you have a plan
 So you can get up and get a little
height if you want and we can also
 Those with range
 Maybe maybe not Maybe it would keep
pounding until you died
 We dont even have to put the tar
inside it could be outside
 All right Yasha were going to be on
the outside then
 This is scary and dangerous work
 Well we dont have any range
 Youre going to be on the outside too I
thought wed put all the ranged people in there
and draw its attention to attack them and then
while its there we can all gang up on it
 Im going to attempt to hide in the
corner
 Oh Yasha before I forget I got you
something
 I hand her one of the silk flowers from
the festival It doesnt press well but you know
 Got for you if we live
 Yeah Im going to stay super crouched
 Or the cat
 The first unexplored room
 Sending the cat to take a look
 This may be the end of the cat
  plus cat
 I have an interesting idea
 Jester is going to cast her Spiritual
Weapon and put it right in the center of
 Yeah A big nice shiny object to
distract
 Are we all pulling against the walls
 Ill roll for Jester
 So fucked
 Its going to be a lot of dodging
 Seven for me as well And Jester is
six
 Do you have advantage
 Were so fucked
 Is it Divine Fury still
 Did it lose a blade just now
 Hex maam
 Hex the robit
 Thank you
 That athletics is already sweet
though
 You also have the mouth you can throw
the tar up in there
 Go for it
 Probably
 Thats a tenfoot blade reach
 Can I see anywhere where there seems to
be a crack in the armor and make a
 I want to see if theres anything that
looks like a good target to start doing some
damage to
 Is there a plate open or anything at the
moment near me
 Im going to try and get to the side
without the blade Im going to try and chop open
one of the plates on the back Im going to start
hacking away at it Actually even with the
blades theres an open place right now Is there
a place for me to start poking the tender insides
 Im going to try and find one armor
plate and start going to town
 I want to get to its left hind quarters
Im going to run over to the opposite side flank
it with the lollipop
 Mmhmm
 First attack is a natural 
 d with ice damage Thats 
 points of damage
 Next attack with the same sword
Actually Im so sorry thats the wrong sword
Thats  points of damage because of the Summers
Dance
 Then the next one Summers Dance again
is not quite as good  That does not hit
 Okay Going for a third strike
 
 Is it worth seeing if its going to
well its blinded so its got disadvantage if it
tries to even hit me with an attack so Im going
to try and back off and climb up that little hill
 Im going to try and hop up that hill
really quickly
 Yep
 As high as I can get to get out of its
range
 Yeah Right over there is good
 That does not hit
 And now it doesnt have a reaction
anymore
 Were in a tight box
 First off were going to have the
Spiritual Weapon take a swipe right at where the
plates are already broken and hit it again Which
is a bonus action and a plus seven to hit Oh
thats not it Its around here somewhere There
it is Thats a 
 Wait wait  Yeah 
 I dont think this is going to do
anything
 I was thinking of trying maybe a
 We could do Sacred Flame or if you were
nearer Id say Cure Wounds Or we could do a
Guiding Bolt
  Were going to do Guiding
Bolt You roll this one
 Thats d radiant damage
 No just d
 I feel like we should open up a little
bit I think shes going to see if she can crawl
over to the door so she can hide behind it in
case something bad happens
 In fact she might be smart she has to
keep the Spiritual Weapon in visual range right
 Okay Shes going to just use that as
some cover
 Thats a lot
 Oh wait no Everybody poops unless
theyre an android because then they must be destroyed
 Poop poop
 So we now know at least a  will hit
 Blinded and restrained right now
 No stop
 I think it would still go poorly but
lets see if it comes to it
 I got a crazy idea
 You first please
 Hey Beau
 No he actually only did four points of
damage Sam only did four
 I cant even Im rooting for Nott
then I look at you and I feel weird
 Im going to run in and try to do a
little bit more damage in here Im coming in and
taking three more shots I caught it Its all
good That one misses
 That one hits Thats a 
 Thats okay  Thats  points
of damage
 For a third slightly less exciting
attack Natural 
 But its magicked up
 Okay thats fine
 Thats two to three so thats five
 So it was a five
 And then six because this is doubled
 Im going to see if I can hop back up
out of am I ever getting out of melee or am I
not getting out of melee
 It will still get an attack of opportunity
on me though Without disadvantage now
 You know Im going to stick around for
now
 Im going to keep a flanking point Im
going to move a little bit so that were spread
out around it So it has to make some decisions
 Thats going to be a lot of movement
 Should I try something offensive or
healingbased do you think How are you doing Caleb
 Okay so were going to do this Were
going to run out and cast Healing Word on Caleb
 Level one
 Yes d plus four So thats seven
points
 But I can use my action for the bonus
action
 You cant up a bonus action to an
action
 Man So I cant cast anything higher
than level one either can I
 I can only cast cantrip at this point I
would have done that in the reverse order if I had
been thinking about things Well what do I got I
got a oh
 Calebs healed and thats good Do we
want to try
 Lets try Toll the Dead
 Its a wisdom saving throw
 You point at one creature you can see
within range and the sound of a you succeed at
a wisdom saving throw or take d of necrotic
 If the target is missing any of its hit
points it instead takes d necrotic damage
 All right Thats  points of necrotic
damage
 Boom
 I think shes going to back up again
 Youre a beast Youre great
 Is there enough gut to hit
  to hit so thats not bad
 So much fun to make fun of him when hes
not here I think at some point you may need
another mustache
 Step all the way back Might as well
because you can always run back there
 Do you get to try and make it not move
 I dont still get to take my attack of
opportunity even though that happened
 He tried to and I try to make a jab
 Ill take no advantage
 I thought I might be flanked
 Thats a   to hit
 Thats  nine points of damage
Yeah nine
 Dex save
 Dex save  for me
 Ten for Jester
 Okay so  points of piercing damage
 Is that the whole or did you not do the
whole thing Im up Im fine
 You want to go first
 Got any thoughts
  Eight points of slashing
damage Oof thats rough Im going to take two
swipes at Im going to try and move Im going
to try and move somewhere where Im flanking Is
there any flanking available at the moment
 I was about to say is it in any way
that going to give her a little cover at the very
least
 Ill move in and then move around
well no goddamn it
 Im going to take a couple shots and see
how this goes
 Because I can use some hits that are all
right
 Yeah thats what were doing First
hit
 Im not throwing away my shot Thats a
 to hit
 Lets get that first thing Thats 
points of damage
 Next strike That definitely hit Thats

  Thats ten points of damage
 Ive got that one really soft blade and
Im rolling it and I want to see that one little
opening and I want it to bend The sword bends and
does that Chinese martial art thing where it goes
and pops all the way into the center of it and I
go wrist deep into the thing
 I got a new die baby Does it look
familiar motherfucker
 Its the negaSnitch
 I found the place where the Snitch came
from I had the woman make me one out of iron
 Boom motherfucker
 Its been middly but its done okay
today
 Gil has been a help today
 Oh no were immediately going to
help
 Yeah we got stlevel Lay on Hands to
get her up
 You did so well No really You did
some good stuff in there You kept it sitting
 Yeah I want to take a look in the other
room too and give them a proper look
 Liam you get ten hit points and you
get 
 You get ten
 From Jester
 Im going to walk over to the door and
start beating it with a sword
 You cant dex cut this thing You cant
pop it in
 Eight
 No go ahead
 The three of us will get that door
open
 At some point well cast Detect Magic
 I mean the fact that were going to
leave the door open and its not coming up but
yeah well go get the core and I figure were
going to do a thorough investigation of the whole
thing once Caleb can do a Detect Magic
 Its like a weaponized version of one of
those balls that you throw up in the air and it
turns inside out
 Im going to keep cutting off the arms
so we can get to it
 What could you have possibly have been
doing Matt Sorry
 Weve had a short rest and well do a
quick search Can you do a Detect Magic spell Caleb
 Oh yeah come on thats all right
 Go fuck yourself Beau Come on
 All right come on were going to get
you guys out of here  Were going to go
 I hold up the glowing crystal You
should see the other one 
 Do I buy this
 I want to have an insight versus
deception check on you
 All right I aint going to mess with
you I just want to know Nope thats an eight
Unless you roll really poorly
 Come on Nott
 We did We may need that later sadly
 It did work us over quite well
 Im going to take the crystal back Im
so sorry we may need this
 He doesnt know about the Schusters
 No we mentioned vaguely that we might
want something
 We have some friends that are currently
interred here for financial troubles Nothing
dangerous nothing violent We were wondering if
we could make a deal for maybe some leniency If
thats possible
 Also we do have a bit of the mechanism
and if everybody here is all right I am of the
opinion that if anybody asks us it was your
brilliant idea to let us into that cell in the
first place to take care of this problem If
anybody asks we know who is absolutely
responsible for this
 You saw something in us You took a
chance and were grateful for it
 All right come on man For fucks
sake Thats a six
 I dont have any persuasion I dont
know why
 Somebody should pick up but we dont
have our talker here right now
 Yeah thats no problem Jester will be
happy to pay

  gold
 Laura you can text right now
 Thats okay Laura will text if she has
a problem with that
 Fjord will pay half So  gold each
 Seven Okay So thats all right Bump
bump Oh and look at that Its all done Look at
that its all done That all happened
 Its as if it never was
 Thats what you get for getting knocked
up man Right there Sorry

 Kids are a deep financial drain man
 We never understand whats happening
either
 Best not to think about it
 Roll for dubstep
 Its us Open it up
 We have a request
 Oh thats just mean
 Im so glad we understand each other
Take care of them
 Im not even going to go there
 Explains why your face is doing that I
suppose
 Its not a good look on you
 Come on lets go find a quiet place to
sleep Im exhausted
 Long rest
 Get your tinker toy
 Going to take it away
 I will only stop if theres something
interesting in a window Otherwise I figure were
heading back to pick up the crossbow
 Skype force five
 If there was possible to buy some food
I want to have some camping food for the rest
like good stuff
 Oh yeah just really good food
 Some meat veggies Just 
 Done
 Were eating good
 Yep Were going to be eating really
good
 Maybe the lesson was for us Im not
sure
 Im so excited
 Ooh nice
 Woo
 That can happen Thats okay
 Thats very you Its very you
 Look at you becoming a people person
Or at least a bird person
 Fuck you too
 We got to get on the road
 We cant thank you enough Well
definitely come back in contact next time were
rolling through town
 We leave her the drinking tokens
 They need use I think its fair
 Very much taking you up on that
 Thats going to end well
 Something very positives going to come
out of that relationship
 Lets get on our way soon
 Lets make our way
 Where was this
 The three of them yep
 Yep
 Maybe you hit him enough so that you
left a clue
 Yes
 To be fair its not like the money
would do her any good right now
 Theyre going to take all of that so if
anything
 Really its our money now
 Im going to have access to this
haversack for a while Im just saying Sorry
 Oh boy Im going to get in trouble
 Oh god No
 No its like playing DD with General
Zod I mean Im happy to do it but it is a little weird

 Its a little much
 Bless you
 Never again
 This is the most complicated revenge
plan Ive ever heard
MARISHA I know These fucking assholes are like
One of us When are you going to join our
misery And Im like No
 Sleep is all gone
 Fjord never came back after watch last
night
 Fjord
 The Travelers bullshit
 That really wouldve worked
 Im going to check the tents Im going
to check the tents to see if their stuff is still there
 Yashas stuff is still here
 So theres nothing behind
 Thats unbelievably bad
 Im going to check the road for fresh
tracks see if anything looks like it was disturbed
 Oh for fucks sake Same roll Two
 Theyre literally scarecrows in the
background
 We are children lost at a Ross Dress for
Less Were never going to see our parents again
Its all over
 
 Hey Thank God
 First thank you Second they may have
just taken the ones that were furthest away from
the light They just picked them off maybe You
walk away from camp thats what happens I mean
its not the biggest or strongest Its the
 Im going to freak out Is there any
trash or anything on the road Im just going to
look for any
 Thats better 
 Moving
 Im going to draw both swords and head
towards it
 I may have already moved I didnt think
of that
 Yeah Im just going to be obvious
 That was fast
 And here have a thing
the crew Okay So Im rolling perception
 What the fuck is going on
 We dont know
 Probably
this along Are we fighting or not
 I havent really thought this through
Where did you come from What are you doing in the
bloody bushes by our campsite
expect to see a bunch of poorly hidden weirdos
with fucking weapons drawn
 Im putting down one of the swords
Were having a very weird day
 Just one Theres still one glowing
sword

 We more or less got robbed last night
and youre the first living human being that weve
seen or not human being
 Not yet But keep it drawn
is to try to get these people back that got got
Is that right
 Were having a very bad morning I
apologize if we came off a little terse All
right fine
 Oh no
 I have an idea Weve all had a bit of a
morning Lets sit down Have a drink We can get
you liquor We can talk about anything youve seen
traveling on the road in the last day or two
 Im Molly
 Is your name Pleasure then
 Oh okay That wouldve been very
inconvenient parenting
be more polite and people say shit like that I guess
 Theres weird parents that do things
 Never mind Theyre very weird parents
 Lets sit
 Is that true
 Well were not necessarily nice people
so thatll work out fine
 Were not
 We dont leave people behind and thats
the deal
 Molly pleasure
 Nott
 We are at the camp right now
 Im going to nervously pack while this
is going on
 She does have a fair point though We
are a little squishy
 Youre in good company right now
 We lost the charm
 I just toss  gold and Im like throw
me a cigarette please
 Im not one to interrogate someones
past Informations information We could use some help
the back of my hand I need some kind of assurance
that when we find these motherfuckers youre not
just going to grab your friends and run Because
Im going to need some backup if Im going to take
them out
 You could also hire us
  gold
 Yes thats how I know you can afford
us

 And we split whatever we find
 You pay at the end of the deal
 I try not to learn their names I dont
want to get attached
 Yes
 Dont panic about it its going to be
fine
 Im all in for this
 We have spare horses now
 Were half packed already
 Thats how its done
 There you go
 We would have to ditch some
 How much can we carry
 Are we going to try and pack horse this
Is that how were
 Or we take the horse and cart at
reasonable speed
 Or stow it
 So were going to drop a Loaf
 Lets leave a marker
work with you guys
 If hes going to die we have to leave a
marker so we can come back and find where hes
been interred
 Poop joke
 We squeezed about as much as we can out
of that one
 Its been a while
 I was going to say
 Kegs been on this road before
anyone have a piece of cloth or something theyre
not using
 I have a giant dragon tapestry
 You now have a cape its huge
 I think the full tapestry
 Youre well disguised as a stoners
bedroom at the moment A dragon on a sheet
 Yeah the orb we havent
 Im more than happy to kill something at
this point Ive got some anger and aggression to
work out
 Welcome to the team
 
 Oh for gods sakes
 Oh for gods sakes Im going to start
going through the woods
 What time is it
 Do we want to head a couple hours or
have this unbelievably safe place What looks like
a very safe place although never mind Were
going to terrible things are just going to
happen Im accepting it this is going to be a
cursed trip Do we want to stay in the haunted house
 Well heres the question
 do we just go
until we have to stop and then we camp wherever
were going to camp or do we find something like
this which is possibly a little safer and then
just wake up very early and run and go further
area is going to be safer than any other
 Trust the local
 Throw a falcon through the window
 Chimney
 Or you could go through the chimney or
the collapsed roof
 We have
open
 I like her
 Im going to hop in there as well
 We always know to look
 I also want to see if theres does it
look like people have been in here recently
 Nothing of value
 A two
 Thats not fair
 Is there a crest on the fireplace or
anything like that Any markings of who might have
lived here at one point
 Can I remove the piece
 Im going to take it Well this
obviously brought luck to whoever was here
 I have a symbol of Pelor
 Ill take a torch
 Caleb you want to do a little scan
while were here See if anything tingles your fancy
 Wait
 Bless you
 Ah
 
 
 Ill pull a single sword and guard
Caleb
 All right
 Im going to try and push Caleb awake
and go for a tree
 Yeah
 Lets go lets go And were going to
head for a tree
 Oh yeah
 Were getting some distance from
whatever
 Oh man
 The Ass Sailor
 Her horse is still there
 
 Its the antisnitch
 Im going to try something fancy Im
going to tap my new fancy sword and Im going to
like a Peppers ghost effect fade out and
disappear and move right into what would be get
some advantage on the one that Beaus been
hitting
 Ill use my movement to get right where
I need to be
 So I have advantage now
 Ill take two attacks
 All right First one a natural one and
an  yeah so one hits
 Ooh Thats ten damage plus three
 Yeah  ten plus three Next attack
Thats a 
 Thats nine plus two so thats 
 Yeah we have a little clink and turn
and face the other one
 Actually do I have any movement left
 Im going to pull back and Im going to
get ten feet in front of Caleb right between
Caleb and the insect No the other side of that
Right there to make a wall there
 Hey you might be able to oh you
burned your move though
 This is not anything I can try and give
them disadvantage on
 Dexterity saving throw
 Yay Thats a 
 I can live with that
 Loo No
 Thats the end of Loo
 
 This is your perfect opportunity for
New crossbow who dis

 Woo
 It will come in handy with these
 Yeah
 Epic combo
 Its a fresh one
 Circle the tree a couple times holding
onto it
 Im going to run and get into flanking
position with this one over here
 Thumpety thumpety
 Yep
 And now were going to take a slice at
this one And thats thatll do it 
 to hit
 So  Ten plus four 
 And again  and a one
 Why I love advantage
 And thats  points of damage
 Its got to be dead by now right
 How is that the one that really
 It had
 
 I needed this And Im going to hide
behind the tree trunk from the other one
 Last of my movement Yeah
 Its Street Fighterstyle
 Beau and Ken

 Oh This is cool
 Give it time give it time
 Nice patronus by the way
 Too many Beaus
 That palette swaps terrible

 We have oats theyll come back
 If you squeeze and twist you can make
it stand up again and you can make the arms move
 Use the ground
 This is a dead horse or can it be
revived
 Im going to make a medicine check for
my horse
 My medicine check is nine
 Neigh
 Water Closet is possibly new pocket
jerky at this point
 Keg can ride with me this is not a
problem If you want
 Youre already taking a good hard look
at your decisions This is good
 Ill ride with you then
 You get your own horse
 I have their armor
 Yeah thatll do it
 Thats fair

 Truly nothing escapes your astute
observation
 Going to go back to that cabin and take
a short rest for a minute
 It would have been in the sack
 Do you want me to go look at the
locker
 Look at the fancy
 Are you feeling lucky punk
 Finally
 I feel like if you give it to me Im
going to end up dropping it and its not really
going to be that useful
 Im very happy
 I say we just camp at the house at this
point I need rest and we have Not going to get
much further
 I say we wake up early Its going to be
dusk in less than an hour
 Well
there If there are more they would come back
 Wherever we happen to find ourselves
 It was just tea We just gave you tea to
smoke it wasnt really

 Herbal tea man Just chamomile tea
 Ive still got my tent so sure
 All right
 Ill also do first watch
 Individual
 Natural 
 Oh Plus three 
 Theres another theres another
campfire
  feet give or take
 Do you want to send a bird maybe
 Shes sleeping
 Id say go ahead I figure if they were
meaning us any harm they wouldnt set a fire
 We get a long rest
 Yeah
 Just us
 A child
 That does have a vibration doesnt it
Im not at my best right now If theyre human
even if theyre friendly Im not the first face
youd want to see
 You have a friendly owl
 Fine I start quietly waking
 I somehow woke everyone at the exact
same time Its one of my many powers
 Left hand right hand tail I got it
all working at once Weve got a bit of a
situation outside
 Its going to require some delicacy
 Calebs dead Its all over
 Theres a boy theres an old woman
 Im going to stay  feet behind and try
and stealth
 We have not had a short rest yet have
we
 Okay just checking
 That die never does that for me
 Im staying  feet back and attempting
a stealth check Thats cocked Thats better
Thats  
 One two three four five
 Five
 Im just walking out at this point
 Weve lost a few recently
 Just woke up and they were gone
 Well see
 Well were making our way to see if
something can be done
 I genuinely dont know how to say no to
tea
 You cant heal a dead horse
 Downtrodden
 Im feeling all right but
 Some people make tea Im going to head
in
 I have cards We could have played
cards
 I will definitely take some
 Theyve got turndown service here
 Always
 Do you know which way this friend of
yours was heading to find them It was north on
the path I suppose
 Well see what we can do
 If its possible well see what we can
do
 All things being equal
 I look at the kid Is he freaked out by
the way I look Is he
 Im going to go down and try something
 Im going to try this I havent tried
this yet Im going to hold up the moon card and
Im going to try and do a sleight of hand trick
and flip it to one of my little moon trinkets
moon baubles
 It would be the most hilarious natural
one eight
 Its not beautiful yet
 I give him the bauble
 I give him a little scratch The
horses
 You did very well
 You were nearly charming
 Were the Three Amigos is really
 Everybodys doing so much better
suddenly Its as if the vacuum means other people
have to start pulling some slack Its nice
 Well suddenly youre being kind of
charismatic Notts making moralistic judgments
that are in the direction of reasonable
 Some days its not hard to do a good
turn
 Cheers
 Id forgotten about that
 Been a little distracted
 If only there were a tiefling here who
possibly spoke and read the same language
 Offroading
 Lets do it
 Do we want to go at a steady pace for
this last hour or do we want to push for a fast pace
 Natural  
 And youre hangry
 Does it look like if we push a little
bit further theres any change in terrain
 Even in far distance
 Want to do one more hour and call it
 Lets send the owl
 If we can find a stone for cover
maybe
 Well set up a proper camp
  Were trying to sleep for
gods sakes
 Lets take the next one
 Nine
 Want to gamble
 No Im not
 This is a game we used to play
 Take my cards set the deck down Put a
question on the deck whoever draws the highest
card has to answer it
 Tarot cards but they have numbers
 I know
 Ill throw one out there for you Whats
the best lie youve ever told
 Ill give you mine if you give me yours
Whoever gets the highest has to tell
 Or whoever gets the lowest has to tell
 Lets roll ds see whose number is
lower
 You can be a little vague with it You
dont have to be I rolled very high
 Seventeen shit
 I did
 Shite Best lie Ive ever told I
pretended to be royalty for three weeks For a scam
 I was Just a little while after I had
gotten my consciousness sort of sorted out and we
got into a town and figured out that we could
actually get some nice digs and they were seeing
if I could maybe bullshit my way through it and
it was kind of my test So I pretended to be a
reincarnated royalty from across the sea
 Yeah 
 That was a lot of fun
 I like knowing that because its not
there that it doesnt matter And it helps knowing
I dont think it matters for anybody I dont care
where anybodys from its nice I certainly dont
care where Im from
 I pour I pass the drink
 Thats usually how this rolls
 Politician
 No no Im very impressed actually
thats you are a good friend to have and a
terrible enemy to make
 To not quite being the worst people
Cheers
 Night
 Thats very fair
 They really had it coming
 Squats
 Thats a deep callback wow
 Ja
 Ill take a round
 Minus five
 Natural   minus five is
 Once they get a little closer lets
slow down and walk to the side of the road and
take a look at this
 What kind of traders do they look like
What are they trading in
 No lets slow our pace
 I think we should wait until they start
to set up camp Theyve got to stop at some point
 Theyre going to have to camp
 And a druid
 Do you know anything about the cages
they keep their prisoners in Are they magically
enchanted or are they just cages
outside Theyll look like theyll be shuttling
around food innocuous items but theres a
magical obfuscation over them
 I sort of figured I figured everyone
else figured at this point really
 I do too But you know people say
things
 How bad are the terms that youre on
with these people
 Thats fair
 Were starting to get a plan
 Theres no cages theyre magically
us
 With his very dulcet tones
 I have a plan Its a bit of a crazy
plan Theyre carrying the means of their own
undoing If we can free whoever is in those cages
we get a lot of allies
 Anybody in there Im sure is going to
have feelings towards these people
 I like waiting until they camp and
coming in at night
 If we can just get into that cage and
untie them without them noticing
 Wait until the sun sets right before
they go to sleep
 I could be into that
 Ambush Free people All one big thing
Im sure theyre not used to being attacked by
people who actually know what they have
 Lets fullspeed blow past them just
nod and keep moving
 All right
 This is a good plan
 Yeah itll be the two of you
 You still have your mote you can use it
now
 All right 
 Well stop when we see somewhere that
seems advantageous
 If we see something
 Yeah but weve got night vision
 Anything that we were going to do would
be near the road anyway
 First
 do we have any dynamite
 We have acid
 Do we have enough Dispel Magic that we
could reveal the cart so we could see it
 Yeah like can you make magic go away
 Magic Have you never seen anybody do
this before Just make magic go away
 Theyre cloaking the cages You could
maybe free the people inside the cages with your
magic hand thing that you do And if their horses
die those carts arent going anywhere
 And then theyre stuck
 If theyre out theyre helping us
 But if we kill the horses the cart
cant leave
 Thats fair too but they could try and
run
 They dont drug their prisoners
 They dont drug them
 One last question How secure are these
carts or do they just trust that nobodys going
to get out of the hog tie
 Its cage cage cage Its not wooden
bottom wooden top Its with bars Theres no
weak point
 As long as we can pick some locks untie
some ropes
person to worry about so first of all Protto is
the lookout Disabling him maybe if you guys are
trying to be stealthy would be helpful because
hes got
 Honestly once the combat starts
especially if youve got Fireballs we can just
make sure those horses are toast
 I could teleport into one of the cages
and start untying people
 With you at the top of one hill if we
get you some cover and you at the other hill if we
give you some cover giving you both some distance
the three of us getting into the middle of it
coming at them at all sides
 Always take out the magic users first
And if we can get a few friends in whoever is in
those cages for all we know thats where theyve
got our people
 Is there a way to embed a spell into the
ground
 Me too
 If they try and climb the hills towards
either of you you can have some ball bearings to
help slip them back down
 Im going to take the gun
 Im taking the gun
 Im taking the gun
 Dex
 Okay
 Oh yeah Im screwed
 Its fine Im seven
 Does it even have anything in it
 We know
 Theres part of me thats wondering if
we hid you in the downed tree if you could sneak
in and start working on the cages before they even
know theres a problem
 Between two hills
 If we can pick the locks and untie
everybody
 We dont need to slow the horses We
have a tree If we want we have a
 We could put her under the tree
 If you find somebody bleeding under a
tree thats not ridiculous Tree fell you
happened to get hit Good luck
 We could put you on top of the tree if
you feel like you want to have some words with
these people
 Im all right with that
 You guys work on peopleI still think
opening the cages is going to be a good call
Well see what happens
 Im all right for this plan
 He did move four or five maps into this
building today under cover of tarp
 I walked in the green room at one point
and it was literally the No Mom Private time
 Its that weird room with the weird hair
salon stuff
 Anybody who wants me to shave their
head Ill do it
  Its less of a tree than I was
hoping for
 Heres your paintbrush Sculpt
 Im so proud you know what that is
 You can also dig a hole right underneath
it too so you can hide
 We want to push the tree over dont we
want to give it a good shove
 We also have a no we left the axe
Never mind
 Yeah
 Yeah you can do that angle
 you can do that angle so that you can
just hit it and know which side it will fall to
 Um just for no that would be too
much I was about to say I could make a bullshit
trip wire that when the tree went down it would
tighten a rope It would pop it
 It would be rope on the ground I dont
know if it would hide in that
 It might be too obvious
 Lets just for fun Im going to have
some of our hemp rope already tied around this
rock with just a big mess of it ready to go so
if we need it weve already got one anchor point
 Ill take bush one
 Calebs going to be all the way back
there
 It gets slowed when it reaches a log
 I was going to say either that or you
hid up a rock
 Once the first caravan passes the log
 Does it just slow not stop
 I think we want to be a little further
 Yeah
 Theyll always be in a line
 If the front one is slowed down then
theyre all going to be slowed through there
 And now theyre ready for a fight
 If you slow the first cart then the
other two behind it are not going to be able to go
any faster either

 And then we can push the tree on the
first cart Thatll be fun
 The first one since its damaged
the third then you might be less likely to be seen
 Or the first one would be more engaged
with us
 If youre invisible you could maybe
help get everybody out
 You wouldnt be able to commit it to
memory and then rewrite it later
 But its nearperfect
 How long does Invisibility last
 Sure but if you use the scroll once we
hear the bells then weve got an hour Your trap
goes off your little alarm goes off
Invisibility then you wouldnt drop Invisibility
thats not concentration
 Oh then fine
 I like this plan Its ridiculous
 No
 There we are
 Were not ranged people
 And you can do stuff once Slows cast
you can also do other things once its rolling
 If things look like theyre trouble
well just go with it
 Go for the druid first
 All right Thatll do Weve got a
plan
 We do set up the tent
 Arent we all
 Im very cold but yeah thatll work
 I imagine its a whippet that looks like
the Matrix of Leadership from Transformers
 You got the touch
 Are we really doing this now
 Wrong timeline
 With advantage because we had time
 
 Pretty good
 Yes I didnt even really understand how
good I had it I was so used to being okay no
matter what even if I rolled a one
 Im so glad youre first Thats great
 
 What does Slow mean by the way
 Oh my god thats amazing
 That means you can attack and then
disengage for free Thats amazing
 Can you get a little bit more around
the or is that all your movement
 
 Is that a bonus action though You have
to do an action or a bonus action you cant do both
 No dubstep today No wub wub
 I look at Keg and
 You got that one
 Right Im going to start my movement
Ive got  feet of movement I can get almost to
the edge of this mountain right
 Thats  feet
 Then I can teleport how far
 Can I get to flanking
 Mmhmm
 Is that way more than I have a  foot
teleport right
 Is it possible to do it halfway through
my movement so I still have two steps that I can
take No never mind Eff it Im good Im not
going to fight it Im going to take two attacks
 I have advantage
 All right
 Both are up
 Yeah thats  Yeah that hits The
 Second one is   yeah thats 
plus seven
 Thats better  points of damage
 That was pretty solid
 Hes going to have a hard time doing
that Disadvantage
 Of my Blood Maledict
 Lets see Im not looking at the right
thing Where is it
 Blood Maledict
 Yeah its  feet
 Amplified
 Yeah I take a lot of damage for that
Five points of damage
 For fucks sake 
 God fucking damn it
 All right
 Did he get disadvantage on the other
attack as well
 Okay
 
 Okay so they both hit
 The one on the hill
 And prone
MATT Yeah youre still within the minimum
distance so with disadvantage regardless That
is with disadvantage a  Whats your armor
class
 Yeah nope
MATT Spends  feet of movement backing away
there as the boss said You do get an attack of
opportunity if youd like to take it
 I used my reaction
 Do I still have a second Blood Maledict
by the way this round I can spend another round
doing it I know we changed the rules slightly At
fifth level do I get two uses or just two options
 All right When we get there
 You did throw two javelins at an
irritating creature so thats good
 Its going to take two turns though
right
MATT She wasnt affected by Slow
 Ah really
 You get an attack of opportunity
 Well actually no Can you freeze her
 Shes still between the two of us She
couldnt have circled
 
 
 Jesus Christ
  points
 Do you have any more attacks left
 Or you could hit them while theyre down
and help them bleed out
 Oh dear
 Motherfucker
 
 Theres no way to get through
 Theres no way I can make it to Lorenzo
from here is there
 Not anymore
 Im going to get my ass kicked if I get
there Im going to try and engage the barbarian
before raging happens
 God damn it Fuck it if youre in with
Lorenzo Im going for Lorenzo
 Ten
 Im going to take three attacks I do
not have advantage obviously
 First attack Is that cocked or is that
okay
 Damn it It was a  Now its a 
 Thats   points of damage
 Not happy Swipe number two Thats a
ten
 Then the other one is a three That does
not hit either
 I think I have a second Blood Maledict
usage now
 I know I was looking because I know
You can invoke a blood curse a number of times per
short rest based on your levels nd one th two
th three Im taking hoping this die rolls
worse come on For fucks sake My Blood Maledict
literally kills me Actually no fuck was I
going to do it advanced I was going to do it
advanced My own Blood Maledict knocks me
unconscious
 I was at four hit points What was I
going to do
 Thank you
  With blood
 Eyes never shut
 I might need to leave the table for a
while
 Yeah I cant watch this
 Goddamn it you people Hi
 It was about ten seconds behind mostly
Hi guys
 I was in fact the bear Thank you to
all those that guessed I was the bear
 Ah not yet not yet Ugh Okay
 This is my stuff
 Its dangerous to go alone
 Just going to get my stuff
 From this small stone temple emerges a
tall not necessarily healthily thin firbolg who
is pale and a grayish color and has a big shock
of weirdly pink mohawk hair
 Im going way off the reservation here
Hes a little gaunt Hes got a little fuzz hes
wearing this bizarre hes wearing this very
gentle silk shirt thats got one long flowy
sleeve Hes got a cup of tea Hes just staring
Huh I think Ive only got three more cups Hold
on I go back in
 Im going to come out Im going to have
a little kettle set up on a little tripod Im
putting it down Im putting a big rod with a big
purple chunk of amethyst on it underneath the
kettle Tapping it a couple times to get the
kettle to start heating up Im going to wander
into the graveyard and find some flowers for tea
 Mr Clay and nah Im fine One
second
 I come back with a pile of redpurple
flowers and Im grinding up This is from Casala
Textile family generations ago but they make very
good tea now 
 Mm Caduceus Clay Sit
 Im going to put out the three cups and
wait for the pot to boil
 Pour out the three cups You have to
share I apologize
 Please let me know what you think
 Only grows here
 Oh please Come
 I havent had one of these in a long
time Thats nice
us
 No Im sure theyre wonderful though
That sounds just great That sounds wonderful
Friends  You have come  Please let
me know what I can do for you Usually when people
come here it is because of some great tragedy
How can I alleve your pain
 I would assume
 People who come here usually have
 Avenge him What happened
 Do I know the Iron Shepherds
 No Im sorry I really dont get to
leave very often especially these days
  Been  seasons
now  seasons Try not to count it just gets in
the way of more important things
 Its been about two seasons I suppose
Little bit of business but its been very slow
 Its the only time that seems to
matter
 Im so excited
 Most people who come here know what this
place is this is going to be delightful Ive
never had to explain it to someone before
 Well boneyard is a bit crass but yeah
this is a place where we take the dearly departed
who have done well and the people who have lived
good lives and we put them into earth that has
been touched by the Wildmother In turn she
grants them with beauty and splendor and sometimes tea
 More like a garden We have been tending
this garden for generations
 Arent we all
 Arent we all
 Well I mean sometimes we can help
people who are on the edge of death We certainly
understand that most people would rather spend
their time alive than not and that makes sense I
certainly have no interest in shortening my life
any time soon
 I mean thats very tricky Once youre
dead theres a natural order to things Theres a
movement that things have to go but in certain
cases Im sure
 Oh I can sometimes help people You
never know
 You know honestly I dont think Ive
had enough experience to have an opinion on that
Im a good gardener
 I grow lilies I grow bramble
mushrooms moss
 Not with an actual snap but yeah I can
do that I dont have to snap though I can be
really quiet when I do it pretty quiet I
actually have to say something now that I think
about it
leave here very much do you
 Ive left a few times I suppose Its
been a while Ive been on my own for a while It
makes you get a little rambly
 Thats a bit of a story My family have
run this temple for generations and Im sort of
the last one left holding the fort down
 No cousins A couple sisters a brother
my parents but everyones either wandered off to
help try and fix whats been going wrong or has
been put into the earth
 Well as Im sure youve possibly
noticed and I apologize if Im breaking some
terrible news to anyone who didnt the forest
beyond my little patch of earth is a little
unsavory Its dark It can be a bit dangerous
Dont recommend going out alone It has been
overtaking our temple for the last hundred years
and recently has breached the walls again
 The last one to leave was my sister She
went east
 Now its just me Its not much to hold
down at this point
 Honestly because its a little
dangerous for a lone person to leave I figured
Id sit here with a kettle and wait for someone to
come along and maybe see if I can make my way out
of here and figure out whats been happening in
this place
 I could leave whenever I want sure
 Thats a really good idea I dont I
mean if you guys in a serious rush if you could
help Im sure we could figure out
 Mmm
you were to come with us wed be asking you to go
into a situation thats not very safe
 Are you inviting me to come with you
 Thats excellent Youre lucky I came
along then This is going to work out really well
 Well youre lucky that I stayed right
here so that you intercepted me because if I had
wandered off ten  feet this may have never
happened
 Well I dont know if I think that
anyone deserves anything but I dont like cages
and Im really
 That seems a little specific Im mostly
interested in trying to take care of the natural
order of the world and nature itself
 Have you ever been in nature Yes
Violence is extremely natural
terrible things They have upset the balance of
nature so much by what they have done They do not
deserve to live Please come with us I have an
idea If you can come with us maybe some of the
firbolgs from my tribe can come help you here
afterwards can help keep the temple afterwards
 Well I dont know about deserve but I
think theres always somewhere theres a plant
that needs some compost and Im happy to make
some more if itll make people happy
 You got a lot of aggression You got a
lot of anger
 Theres only
 Okay
 Is that a time of plant
 Ive actually already packed Ill go
get my things
 I do I may ask for it later
 I like this one Ill go get my green
beetle armor
 Thank you My sister made it Im very
proud of her
 I get a big knotted wetlooking stick
that is covered in lichen The armor is also
covered in lichen Its a big growing living wet
thing It has a big purple amethyst rock at the
top of the staff I get a little shield also made
out of beetle
  Give me a minute Just going to
walk around once take it in
 All right Im ready to leave This is
going to be a little much but I think I can do
it Im ready
 Casala
 What did you think you were drinking
 Yeah Thats very close Its good Its
always worth trying
 Casala family I think we have eight in
their generation I was only here for the last two
 Caduceus Caduceus Clay You can call me
Clay
 I have been trying not to show you this
art for two weeks now
 Sure
 Okay
 That doesnt seem like a very good
idea
 You make me figure out how to do this
 Is she always like this This seems kind
of extreme
her
 Come here All right and I get in there
and Im going to do Cure Wounds and theres going
to be a little bit of lichen that grows on the
wound really quickly
 Its fine Do I roll for that
 Six points of damage six points of
healing
 It felt very
 Honestly its been so long since Ive
been around anybody I genuinely wouldnt have
been able to tell
 That would be the hope I imagine youd
leave the woods once you went into the woods I
mean you dont just want to sit there I mean
thats what I do but Im not sure that was really
a great decision so yeah huh
 Im just thinking out loud Ive had a
few years to just think out loud
 Been about  give or take
 Thatll do
 No
 I had to think a little bit about it
but no
 A what
 That seems like a really good idea
actually I should start doing that
 What a good way to make a decision
 I dont know what any of that means
along now
 All right
to you guys but I dont love the odds
can draw more of them outside we will stand a
better chance We will have more power than you
had last time
 Tonight can I just politely ask the
forest to just give us a round this time just in
case I want to talk to a couple of trees see if
theyd be all right just giving us a little passage
 All right Wisdom save or wisdom check
 All right 
 First stealth check Wheres my stealth
Seven
 Thats very specific
 Are you just going for that or is that
going to mean something
 In a minute its going to be 

 How about now
 But its closer to 

 Not quietly
 This Phil must be a really bad person if
youre
 I know Im new here and youve
obviously all got some kind of hierarchy going
here of how you work this out
 That makes sense I suppose my question
normally if Im looking at a complicated problem
I just think about what it is that I really want
and then I go and I do that
 Well I was going to say that if you had
to put one above the other If you get one thing
you get to do it
 So youve got to get in and out of the
basement That seems to be the conversation then
is getting in and out of the basement Im sure
inevitably youre going to kill a whole bunch of
people in the process of that but as long as
youre focused on where youre going and what
youre doing that may help with this wanton
violence against Phil who Im sure is a terrible
person He shot an owl
 No that aint funny
 Im already regretting the name
 No
 What
 I dont really know how to answer that

this thats great
 Let me have a d So thats 
nine points halved of radiant damage
 Half of nine points of radiant damage
 As long as hes in the range of it hes
at half speed
 That is my action As a bonus action

 I thought I had a thing I could do
Sorry one second I dont have much As a bonus
action Im going to can I see Caleb
 As a bonus action can I cast Healing
Word as a level two spell
 Only a cantrip now okay Nevermind
then
 Well this has been exciting
 Manage a Bed Bath  Beyond Its going
to be nice
 Why are we standing next to each other
 Oh wait once hes within  feet of
me he gets half speed Oh no hes not walking
 Once he enters the field he also I
believe
  is the
  so half of  Its radiant damage
Is radiant damage doing anything to him
 Okay
 Hmm
 Im having a little regret that I didnt
pack that Faerie Fire man
 Who knew I was drinking tea last time I
got to pick spells
 Im curious about these rooms back here
those grates that youve still got covered over
Whats over there
 Yeah I want to run over there
 Im going to run over there
 Itll get me that close I would like to
be a little further away so that I am not in blast
radius with two other people
 Yeah Looks to be a little better Darn
it yeah Im going to use my action to
 
 Okay Im going to turn back around
That was my action to take a look in there
 Aw man Okay thats my turn
 
  points
 Im good
 Okay lets see what I can do with this
First thing Im going to do is use my bonus action
 To pot a very nice plant Oh man its
so hard to do this Okay Im going to use my
bonus action to Spare the Dying to you so we got
that
 No Spare the Dying for me is a bonus
 No more death saves Im going to run
over to Beau Im going to tap her and use
Wheres my stlevel spells Is it Cure Wounds
 But I can cast it at a ndlevel if I
have a ndlevel left
 Im going to cast Cure Wounds but
because shes unconscious she gets all the hit
points back not just

 Youre at  hit points
 Youre at  hit points
 Level two
 Plus five
 It means he doesnt have to make death
saves at least for the moment but probably could
use some healing and Ive already used all my
actions
 Im going to back up against the one in
the corner so I have a little bit of cover
 No the other corner Yeah a little
coverage there we are
 Im going to run over to Shakste and
while Im running Im going to use my bonus
action to down a potion of healing which is
lets see if Im doing this right Thats seven
hit points that I regain I should mark that as
used Then once Im there I have to use an action
to feed him a potion correct
 Okay Heres the question
 does the
potion also get my bonus
 I figured not but I thought it was
worth asking
 Im going to give you a potion and
lets see what I roll Thats   hit
points Youre awake again Im going to use the
rest of my movement to get some cover behind the
table I suppose is the closest cover Ive got
right now
 Im getting partial cover
 Smoke them if you got them man

choice that you can see within range
 Seven points Oh my god Im feeling a
little better
 Just cup around
 Thats a lot of calculator
 Monks man
 Hey welcome back

going to do Detect Undead Im going to see if I
can understand what he was
 
 I figured
 I dont know if theres much we can do
with this This is a bit yeah no you dont
want to drink that Lets sweep that away why

stick until the lock broke or hit the lock with
Sacred Flame or something fun Just blow it
 Oh really

like fun

Thats not how this works I mean things that you
do are good or bad but people are just people
You guys keep doing good things and all Ive seen
is you doing good things Im not sure what the
confusion is about
 Yeah I know
and I find that a lot of people do a lot of
talking but Ive always found its the people who
hush and do good things are the best ones Id say
that youre in that class If you ever hear the
word hush know that Im close Im going to
take these people and get them back to where they
belong
 Hmm

 Wow Have you been sitting on that all
night Because that was amazing
 Wow thats been a while
 Liam
 There is a flash pan where theres a
preload powder basically a powder capsule
attaches to a flash pan The hammer contains a
sparking mechanism that hits a plate causes a
spark to hit the powder in the flash pan goes
into the gunpowder thats within thats actually
packed inside of the barrel and sends the shot
out
 It actually is a specific kind Its a
flint
 Although people have probably gotten
creative with that at that time but the Percy
tech was just a flint He was trying to do other
stuff and always failed
 It would be a bag at the front with a
flint that would spark on pressure So as long as
you fired it hard it would cause the spark when
it hit and detonate
 Welcome to tinkering man

shopping

to punch
 Yeah I thought of one Oh what

happy to follow another one This is not where Im
supposed to be

 Maybe you dont know
 Just so Im clear as I really feel like
Im playing catch up hes the one responsible for
that er pearl that youve got in you
 Also the deal with his little

that really annoyingly long drive from San
Francisco but its so pretty
 Were you just thinking about that Dont
think I wasnt
 Oh yeah you are
 Im also going to distribute I made
everybody a potion of healing so everybody gets

bit of a weird flavor but theyre
 Theyre great

 Youre just going to make a sloshing
sound when you walk for a while
 I am all for that
 You think you got it All right
 Mr Caleb
 What are you playing with over there
Seemed really intent on whatever it was
 Its too late Im already ready for it
All right
 Gotcha Hey Miss Jester Apparently you
picked something up in Zadash Im supposed to
see the thingy in your bag
 I dont know Caleb was being very
shifty about it
 Id like to see any questionable thing
you may have
 What is that
 Is that even natural
 What is this thing
 Im going to meditate into the box
 Too soon
 Does this place make me feel a little
uncomfortable
 Okay
 All right
 Huh I think I have a passenger and
thats interesting
 I did

 He is It is
 Im trying to not make assumptions
 Good to know Ill keep mums the
word Huh
 I wouldnt know but
 You should probably experience this

 Do I know what a gnoll is
 
 Irregular gnolls
 Irregular ones
 Im new
 Caduceus Caduceus Clay Pleasure
Youre a lot shorter than the last one they
 Introduced me to
 Yeah Ive noticed everybody else is
very short Its fascinating
 Pleasure to make your acquaintance
 This is a place where you did good
Thats nice
 I dont know everywhere that Ive been
with you so far people seem to be really happy to
see you Its a sign in my opinion
 Pick one
 Reminding everyone that we have all seen
each other naked
 Oh lord
 Im feeling very prideful at the moment
Thank you
 This sounds exciting

 All right
 Yeah itll be fun
 Yeah
 I dont think Ive done this before
 Oh yeah no you just got to ask
permission before you do anything
 Oh yeah I ask permission to any animal
I interact with anything I eat and its always a conversation
 Yeah I say were going to be Well I
explain to the horse that were going to be moving
south and Id really appreciate their cooperation
in the process and how long we expect to be going for
 Yeah
 I mean can you do it without Can you
talk without talking is that a thing you can do
 I can hear you but your lips arent
moving This is nope its not working for me
Nope Probably take ten minutes actually trying to
do that before we get going
 Yeah
 Manners will get you everywhere
 Thats some black magic right there
 Thats really impressive and you sound
like a kid that fell down the well when youre
doing that
 Ill take first watch
 All right
 Yeah nothing gets by me unless I
Well no thats a natural 
 Oh yeah youre just pointing at
things Got it got it Yep got that Yep oh
got that Got that yep Where Yeah
 Its tundra except for my little
patch
 Fair play
 That doesnt look right
 That
 Now if I were inclined to be a trap or
an ambush of some kind or Those rocks shouldnt
be that way thats all Im saying
 Its giving me the bad feelings
 The rocks
 I mean Im okay if you are
 Never had a rock really hit back
 This looks a little weird to me
 Its my mime
 Im going to use Thaumagurgy to cast
my voice very loudly behind the other side of the
rocks Thaumaturgy it just got stuck in there
 Thaumagurgy I want to use my
Thaumagerchy
 Oh so I cant throw my voice then
 Hang on a second I can do tremors in
the ground
 So Im going to start tremoring the
ground right over by those rocks
 The rocks look a little weird I dont
know
 It means the rocks look weird
 Theyre giving me a bad feeling I dont
have a lot of bad feelings
 All right
 Maybe Its an awfully suspicious trail
marker If it was a trail marker you usually
stack three stones make it look very intentional
Have you ever seen a painting where someone tries
to paint stars but the stars dont look right
because theyre the wrong kind of random Thats
the wrong kind of random
 The random nature makes and the random
that man makes
 All right lets go take a look then
 That makes me a little sad on a
fundamental level
 No left right left right ugh
 Were keeping an eye out for anything
else happening
 
 Yeah Im feeling good
 Oh thank you
 
 That looks like somebody on the run
 Im going to change my appearance To a
grungy human with shaggy hair
 A long orange goatee a puffy red beard
and scruffy long red hair Human Tasmanian Devil
 We look related then
 We do okay
 Thats obscene
 Barter it at the very least
 He was responsible for the circus
thats all he just took responsibility
 I would love to have an insight check
insight check from Caduceus
 I want to know whats going on in there
Thats a  
 Im rolling real well today Rolling
high
 I can do this if you like
 I dont have to know
 Its more than a thank you I feel that
you have to be free so that you can finally pay
your debt
 No this is you hiding from your debt
Youre a man who is afraid of what you owe I
understand Thats okay Itll feel so much better
when youre finally free from this belief
 This is not your debt Your debt lies
elsewhere I know these things
 Itll be your last one in here
 No
 I just know a guilty man when I see
one
 He doesnt want to leave
 Hes not even happy hes hiding in
here
 Its not that he feels unsafe you can
just see its all over his face
 You can tell a lot from people just by
looking at them
 Thats an entire conversation for
later
 In a terrible crash
 With a man named Buick

 I want to see I think this is a man
who needs to be free so that he can be at peace
with himself
 Why would you not want to why would
you want to be in a cell Why would you want to
stay there Someones offering you freedom for
nothing
 Hes putting on theres so much there
Hes hiding something
 I just know I just
 I will throw some money at this
 Would there be a buyout cost if we
wanted to pay it Is that just the straight or
could there be some sort of deal
 Yeah
 Weirdly and I dont know youve spent
more time with him but he strikes me as a man
whos weirdly happier in jail right now than
hed be out of it
 I think he needs to face some stuff It
would be really healthy for everyone involved
 Thats 
 Ill put  gold down right now
 Theres no generosity in this
 Were at  we need three more
 Interpretive dance
 I gave you four
  I think it was  yeah
 I already knocked it off Thank you
Nott
 A word of advice
 Whatever was keeping you in this cell
whatever was making you comfortable in here be
careful of it Theres something inside you thats
trying to put you in a box Whatever guilt youre
feeling whatever thing that you feel that youre
to blame for I would unload that burden If not
on us on somebody although were happy to take
it
 Intimidation is fine I was trying to be
kind of nice
 Seven
 Hes very sad
 I see funny rocks I see funny people
and this is not sitting right theres something
unnatural about the build
 I would like to make a dexterity check
to see if I catch it
 If thats okay
 
 Appreciate that thats nice of you
 I told you why I told him why Because
its not healthy to sit there and just hide from
your problems
 Is it
 How much money was it
 Yeah how much is that
 Seems fair
 How much money was that amount
  thank you
 I mean whats the point of having gold
if youre not using it for something I mean
otherwise its just something thats making it
heavier to walk
 Sounds odd but all right
 Worth it Fucking worth it Im feeling
worth it
 That was by the way the best whisper
Ive ever had Im not telling them at all what
you said but that was amazing
 That was deep
 Im happy to take it This was
definitely my instigation so I should bear the
brunt of it
 That was weird
 I do my meditation
 Wow What does the other side of failure
look like
 Just the horse butt on the top
 Natural one
  Their families must know
pain
 Im really enjoying this I get to see
this wonderful countryside
 Sure
 
 Again with advantage
 All right
Natural 
 Rocking it today
 
 Mr Fjord what do you think of that
 Do you recognize those uniforms
 Are we okay with these people or should
we
 Fair
 Is there a way to turn off the effect
 Theres got to be a way to turn off the
enchantment maybe
 Im probably not the person the make an
arcana check for this but here we go
 Nope That is a natural one Which gives
me a zero
 What
 Oh yeah Thats
 What
 It may not come back is the thought
 Yeah actually I was going to say you
havent done it yet I think that
 I did
 May I
 Theres actually nothing on the cart
This is a preventative measure against theft You
can feel free to inspect the cart yourself if you
like
 Ten
 Its kind of neat right
 We look forward to seeing you on our
return
 Oh I figure were not difficult faces
to remember
 You too
 
 Mmhmm
 No advantage
 Thats a 
 I am rocking today
 I know Common Elvish Giant Sylvan
 Theres giants up ahead
 Shh
 All right Do I know where the voice
came from
 Okay
 All right
 Its about  feet away
 All right I think hes planning on
ambushing us
 Im going to cast
 Just one I can see although hes
talking to someone Im going to cast Calm
Emotions over there just to see what that does
 Its a foot bomb in all that section
I cant see
 Against 
 What are they wearing
 Im just going to calmly keep moving the
cart by them and Im just going to wave back and
say Thats some great leather youre wearing
there You look great
 They also dont see any of you They
just see me and whoevers sitting up front right now
 Yeah please bring it I feel bad that
we didnt get to
 I feel like if you worked so hard on a
map I was feeling a little guilty
 I am enjoying this character so much
 Im so tall All right
 I think it was just me at this point
 Yeah because you guys can see this
whole thing
 Isnt he Isnt he pretty
 I can understand this too and Im
going to chime in a bit I think its really
unfair youre just putting this all on him I
think you really youve got to chill out a bit
I mean you seem like a nice guy Youre really
listening to this God Im also still very
gently still moving forward
 You guys have got issues man
 Language Come on
 Yeah man Who doesnt speak Giant
Thats just rude
 I dont think youre dumb And Im just
still going 
 Bless you
 Wizards man
 Stay all right my friend You stay all
right
 Dont let anybody tell you what you
cant do
 Its not a concentration by the way
 Calm Emotions for me is not Doesnt
is not a concentration No Yes it is Youre
right never mind I dont know how to read spells
yet
 Yeah So you know weve been rolling
 Yeah were going And now Im booking
 Boom motherfuckers
 And you have to turn the little marquee
again
 Wed better run
 I tell the horses were going fast
 Animal handling
 
 The jig is up
 There we go
 You can hold
 
 Or  Was it 
 Youre on your own And were moving at
speed
 Is this the same day as we disguised
ourselves or have we had a sleep
 From the jewels Okay so yeah youre
fine
 Im trying to figure out that thing that
I can do where I can make someone vulnerable to
terrible things
 Yeah Im trying to find it Ah Path of
the Grave
 Im too far away Its  feet
 All right so I cant quite do that yet
Thats really frustrating So Im just going to do
what I can do from this distance which is Sacred
Flame I suppose
 I always take the left
 No on my left That one yeah
 Dex save
 Thats my action Yeah thats all I
got
 Thats a shame it was a good roll
 I know we are so done
 First thing Im going to do is Im going
to tap my staff and say Time to get out
children Im going to bring a little nest of
creatures right on the back of his business right there
 Well they get everywhere Its a
swarm
 What is the attack for that by the way
I think I might have that here hold on where is it
 Its been acting a little weird It
doesnt give me the attack stuff for it because
its not linked to it properly
 Thank you sorry
 Ten
 Im going to need a little bit more I
turn to one of the beetles and Make him feel
this and have the beetle bite me and then swarms
and attacks him Im casting Bane
 Yeah because the beetle brings my
blood I have to spill blood for this
 It only can hit the one
 Fucker
 Oh yeah were doing good
 Thats okay Im just going to spend a
spell slot
 Thats what I got
 The horses know who our friends are
 I dont suppose the other swarms get an
attack of opportunity
 So he doesnt get to move does he
 From this position you can clearly see
how this one would reach

 Whoa I love it when a lineup like that
happens
 Im going to be stopping the carts
 This guys going to be trashed
 Am I within  feet of the guy on the
ground The one thats far away
 Theres no way I can get within  feet
of him
 Im going to tell the horses to whoa
 Im going to tell the horses to whoa
 Im going to tell my beetles to keep
munching on that guy whos on the ground
 Im going to hold my Im so sorry
this is a new spell Im learning Stop there we
go Im going to hold Channel Divinity until the
one on the grounds within  feet of me Im
going to whoa the horses and hold Channel Divinity
until theres a creature within  feet
 Im also going to move to the front of
the cart too so Im right there next to everybody
 Yeah
 Were all Yeah
 Im going to cast Cure Wounds on Caleb
as hes walking by in this state
 Also Im going to go over and cast
Decompose on that one thats See what pops out
 Im going to take a handful and give it
a smell  Mmm Look at that hes useful
now Thats good thats so good
 Ah Im going to go get back on the
cart
 Oh man Dig your fingers into it
 Goat meats great
 Theres a lot of medieval cooking that
would want the meat to get a little gamy Im just
saying Sometimes it improves the flavor
 Thank you
 Lets try a new die Oh thats not bad
Thats a  Itll do
 I got to see this Im getting up
 I am so excited for a show
 Well youre going to probably get
rustled a bit but Im sure theyll let you in eventually
 Perhaps there is something else
 Hit her with a Sleep spell
 Theyre bastards those birds
 You can make him a little mask and then
hed be the Crimson Weasel
 Taliesin and Caduceus have very
conflicting feelings right now
 Ive never been so disappointed to have
rolled a vegetarian character in my entire life
 You guys all right Is this all on the
level Im just going to check with the animals
that everything is copacetic
 
 I mean I asked them
 Yeah no I just asked them
 Do the animals seem like theyre cool
with this too I was talking to the animals
 Thats all right
 Theyre not freaking out at me
 Sure All right
 I feel that
 Im so glad that this is happening
 This is going to make a giant alligator
so happy
 Weasel
 Got a tattoo on his left wing
 Just Icarus tattooed on his wing
 Good luck to you
 Oh you got goldfished
 As soon as one of these animals runs
away well actually be nine of us Thats really
exciting
 I mean the name of the group is kind of
a thing
 You know I dont know

 Guess Ive never really thought about
it
 Four
 A very special episode
 Yeah thats not doing it
 This will work out way better than that
Tamagotchi you owned
 Well that sounds nice
 Well actually
 Big Sur is nice this time of year
 I heard the whole story between games I
dont really you should just know
 Thats a very fair point
 I definitely want to do that That
sounds great
 I dont have any expectations so Im
not sure if thats true or not
 Im going to take a moment to look
through the sand and rocks and see if theres
anything interesting
  Investigation Wait hold on
Investigation Never mind thats a six
 Makes sense
 Youre right this is spectacular
 He looks like a Thaddeus
 Why not a both
 Im going to take a minute to try and
explain to the Professor what a doctorate is
 If hes confused
 All right
 Oh yeah Im going in Forget this
 This smells weird I really like it
 Never before
 Its amazing
 Oh man I cant even imagine
 I think we can camp on the beach before
we leave town but if people are anxious to get
this done
 It also occurs to me this is an eastern
ocean isnt it So it would be a sunrise or a
sunset for this ocean
 We need an orrery now to figure this
out Im very excited
 Without a doubt
 Thats really beautiful Thats amazing
Does it do this every night Wow
 Thats exactly what I thought too
 How long has it been here for
 Thats beautiful
 I was just thinking I felt a little
underdressed
 No one talks to anyone that commits mail
fraud
 It was on the tip of mine but thats
fair
 I may join you in that if thats all
right
 Ill also humanize myself and put
together something that looks appropriate for the
sort of people Ive seen walking around Lot of
pearlescent whites and greens
 Oh thisll go poorly
 No Im not
 One foot up and down
 Straight intelligence check 
 Definitely the same pink hair but tied
back Hes a thin adult human man whos got a
little bit of a scruff going into a bit of a
shaggy goatee If this is appropriate for it a
little bit of the French Restoration but nice
pale opalescent whites
 Oh my god Okay yes thats fair Its
muted but fun
 Thats a lot of happiness and thats
okay
 Lighten up a bit
 I named the seagull in my head too
 Steven
 Steven Seagull
 Everybody at home gets out their swatch
they got
 I dont
 Ah Oh
 Sure
 Aw
 No
 Very impressive
 Oh
 No he did not
 Yeah I pop back up
 Less of a cemetery more of a graveyard
Its a pleasure to make your acquaintance
 Only recently yeah
 Aware of it but just trying to only dip
a couple toes in
 I dont know what that means
 Funny hair
 Does she have a name
 You mentioned the lighthouse Would we
need anything to enter the lighthouse Some token
of familiarity or some name that would get us a
tour to meet the proper people there
 Gale
 All right
 Oh thats right
 Sure
 Oh my god your mother knows The
Gentleman Thats so cool
 Wait what
 This is the perfect time for a game of
Pictionary Im so excited Both of you dont look
 I dont understand whats happening
 It is amazing whats happening over
here Oh yeah
 Yep theres no getting around it
 Does it look like the same person when
we look at the two drawings
 Okay
 Oh no
 I dont Is there a thing Oh well
 I dont understand what that
 Thats fine Lets go ahead
 No you might not have been I dont
know
 Theres a lot of blue people in the
world
 I assume
 Only just now
 This is the sort of conversation one
should have in person I suppose
 Perhaps hes hiding which is why he
couldnt answer that question
 Oh yeah
 Ill head to the lighthouse
 Survey the territory
 Works for me
 Thats a great idea
 Also on the water
 Its beautiful
 Ill find the door
 Are you Gladys
 I think were supposed to talk My
names Caduceus Mother sent me
 Thats not terrible 
 I am I am This is a long and
complicated story I suppose Weve been holding
the north against something dark Something
threatens our small temple Have you ever been to
the Blooming Grove before
 Its quite all right This has been the
first sign of the Mother Ive seen since leaving
my home
 Her temple is under threat up north I
was waiting for a sign and I think this is the sign
 Yes Im so sorry how rude my friends
and I its only fitting Is there any service
that we can provide for you for your graciousness
in allowing us into your lighthouse
 I feel that there is wisdom here Would it
be possible to learn more about this place possibly
 Thank you
 Im very excited
 What chase
 Well get there
 Its an inconvenient moment right now
 Were having a moment right now
 Exciting
 Its beautiful
 Im not even looking at the view Im
looking at the lighthouse
 Im going to compare it to mine a little
bit
 I have my own responsibilities to her as
well
 This place its so different Was it
perhaps a gift from the Lawbearer long ago
 It is beautiful I will admit we have
many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here
I have two favors that I would ask of you and I
understand if theyre not possible
 Very fair We have a friend in town in
need of a good turn and this good turn we have
a friend whos threatened and were hoping to
maybe glean some information
 Its my friends mother
 Shes having difficulty with somebody
 Do you perhaps see the thing beneath the
city
 I fear that he may be in contact with
something inappropriate
 With disadvantage
 Keep on target
 Meta that Sluice there
 Oh boy
 Im sure we can figure something out
 She does good work
 I do have my last request and Ill take
these people out of your hair
 Im looking for a sign of where to go
next Im waiting for the Mother to speak Is
there a place to sit quietly and find her voice
 Ah thats fair For your trouble Im
going to pull out one of my teas
 Its blessed from the Mother herself
from one of the graves of the less scrupulous
families of the north Good for muscle tension I
find Grew it myself
 You serve the Mother well Its only
fair that you be rewarded
 Thank you for your time
 Shes trying to get in the boob
 This is going to end poorly
 I thought she was really nice
 Did you mean for that to rhyme or was
that just
 Its the first time I got it
 Thats where you find carpets I was
about to say yep
 We get nine birds Its nine
 I like turtles
 Its time for oysters
 Youve got it Because I was going to go
get some milk too Two milks also One hot please
Two milks one hot
 What is happening I dont know
anymore
 Whats your typical rank on board ship
if you dont mind me asking
 Very cool
 Caduceus I dont okay yeah

 I apologize if were anxious We just
want to get our business concluded as quickly as
possible and move on to more pressing matters I
mean if you see Marius or know that hes around
youre welcome to tell him that people are trying
to deliver something I get the impression that
hes a friend and I also get the impression that
hes probably used to a fair bit of trouble and
were hoping not to be trouble
 Well its complicated Im not even
going to pretend that I entirely understand it
myself Were
 Again I hate to ask personal questions
but
 Bastard Have you ever sailed with
Marius by any chance I mean do you have an
impression of him as a sailor or
 Ill have to say that we might be the
answer hes looking for Were removed from the
actual situation Were more delivery by
happenstance more than anything else We have our
own questions and problems and concerns which can
only be answered by someone who has a better grasp
of the situation
 I know people And turtles
 Wow Persuasion
 
 Sipping my milk Milk mustache

 You wouldnt mind me asking for a brief
description of him so we can identify him when we
see him That would be most advantageous
 Super cool
 Thats pretty cool
 Sure I imagine hes probably a little
jumpy of people if he owes money and that sort of
thing That can make someone very mistrusting I
would hate to invoke your name in front of him but
 Thanks friend thats great
 Oh of course not
 Well I mean is Orly giving the vibe
that he is enjoying the company or giving the vibe
that he now wants to enjoy his drink in peace
 Well we got one more problem we got to
deal with which is your moms problem
 And thats the one where were going to
maybe have to get a little difficult
 Yeah Do you know anyone who knows how
to get down to the Sluice Weave or has ever been
there by any chance
 I dont actually know what Im talking
about to be fair
  I like tortles Yeah weve
got somebody whos a bit of a problem we have to
deal with as well This is a completely separate
issue
 Its somebody being impolite to a friend
of ours
 So true
 Youve had your Creole
 I was waiting for a fluorescent light to
turn on No it was good you were engaged
 Hey
 We didnt really talk much last time
You were in your own space
 Well here you are
 I think perhaps its destiny Do you
believe in destiny
 But you dream about islands and you go
to them
 I know I like you
 Let me see you eat a meal then Ill
figure out what tea to give you
 Well I suppose if the Stormlord put you
on this path then youre with us now because of
some divine intervention I think its important
to follow ones feelings on such things I commend you
 Yeah
 Caduceus Caduceus Clay Its a
pleasure
 Thank you theyve been your friends
have spoken very highly of you in your absence
 I never understood that penny
 Oh no Okay thats oh wow
 Sorry Sprinkle
 Is there something we can throw Hold
on
 Is this a good place for Thaumaturgy
Fuck it lets accent this
 Free round for anybody who has any
information
 Is that something you can do
 Then yeah
 Im going to get a little smaller so
that I take up less space in the boat
 Im going to turn into a shaggylooking
halfelf literally probably look a bit like
Shaggy from Scoobydoo
 It changes the amount of volume but I
actually do change volumetrically in size though
I can get several feet shorter Its a firbolg
thing
 I can seem up to three feet shorter
but
 Well I did it anyway
 Youve just described every environment
that life can manifest in
 Are we calling dibs on the boat
 I think I saw it if I recall
 She pointed it out didnt she When we
were
 Ill feel confident in my knowledge
thats fine
 Yeah
 This is everything I wanted
 Youll be all right
 
 Frumpkin go take a look at that if you
wouldnt mind
 Based on that description I want to see
if I can figure out what buildings would be
directly underneath do my own mental map of what
has been described
 Oh dear
 Make an intelligence check
 All right that will be fun
 
 Maybe that thing is maybe directly on
top of what you were looking at
 Im keeping an eye out
 Are we just leaving a boat here is that
the
 No
 Better than what I was going to do
 Oh yeah
 See Nugget heres the situation
Everybody else is going into this thing in the
tunnel I dont know if you want to go into the
water if you want to just hang out here and hope
that everything goes okay or if youve got a
preference But Ill tell you what You can hop
on with me if want to go with us on this
adventure If youd rather just sit here Ill
leave you a little food and well probably be back
in a couple of hours
 Yeah of course
 So you just want to hang I guess
 You want to come with me
 Animal handling
  Im sorry not  
 Hold your breath on the count of three
 Oh youll be fine well just give you a
little I can just give you a little tap if
anything goes wrong
 Im going to slow my breathing Im
going to take one last look around to see if
anyone notices any of the commotion that were
causing
 Perception check
 Yeah my perception check was bad for
me which is an 
 Ive slowed my breathing Ive calmed
myself and Im just going to take a very gentle
dive and move in
 Yeah we tied the boat
 Athletics check that one was not so
good

 Thats a three
 Never done this before
 I can thankfully hold my breath a long
time
 The puppy is having am I feeling a
twitch or is it having a
 Oh thats better 
 He wanted to come
 Ill look around
 Lets head quietly in that direction I
think might be
 Is this a fancy room or is this just a
more of a
 
 So you rolled low initiative
 You rolled a seven
 I believe so
 Im currently in hold on yeah
 All right Thats a 
 How well can I see right now
 Okay Im considered blind Thats fine
Theres nothing much I can do about that right
now Im going to hold a Sacred Flame until I
can actually see what Im attempting to attack
Like until I can see well enough to
 Yes Sacred Flame In the meantime Ill
just stay to myself and maybe try and walk around
to yeah just like there
 I could use a little light
 Thank you
 Sacred Flame
 Dex saving throw 
   points of I believe is
that radiant damage Yeah  points of radiant damage
 That does not hit
 Sure Is it disadvantage because I cant
see
 Thats the same roll Thats 
 Im still blind
 At some point Im going to have to
Ive never fixed the fact that Im a cantrip down
which I will have to fix at some point because
this is
 I think I had this at one point and
yeah it did not have that Im going to just ready
another actually Im free now Im going to try
and back into the corner near that treasure chest
Im just going to ready another
 Barrel Its filled with treasure

 Its one gold coin Im just going to
ready another Guiding Bolt for the second I can
see anything
 The water elemental is going to sit
there and have a long thought about its relationships
 Sea foam thats all you are
 I really actually have a itd be
easier if I could see where I am or
 Oh thats much better
 I just tap the stone Ten hit points
 Is there an intense discoloration
maybe of the mold underneath the grate Is it a
different kind of
 Yeah
 Youre so good
 Oh thank you
 
 Youre in another game
 Okay because I was like ten seconds
away from casting Eyes of the Grave
 Well theres an easy way to deal with
this
 Algars got a control mechanism I
think
 No

 Oh god Shit
 Woo

 You know I think one of the bits isnt
turning on It should be just about
instantaneous
 Yeah
 
 
 The flaggy thing
 Yeah
 Algar might have something
 Yes Im so proud of you
 To be fair there is nothing better than
Dungeons  Aquarium Repair
 No I feel good that youre making this
happen
 Things are looking better
 Yup there it goes
 Nice
 Nope Four
 Im going to get up and be like Man
Ive got to get that bracelet off that guy god Ugh
Im going to
 Im going to try and get up and crawl
around into the corner right there get as far into
the corner Am I within  feet of Algar
 Am I  feet from Algar
 Motherfucker Uh
 It is a little dicey Thats as far as I
can move
 Then I have no damn movement
 Okay Im going to lets see First
thing Im going to do is oh man Im so sorry I
dont quite have my shit together
 Im going to use my Blight Staff
Im going to use my bonus action to cast
the swarm
 Im going to use it to get how far
away
 Well I mean they fly
 I figure theyre  so
Flying beetles
 Theyre going to go irritate the other
side of the water monster at the moment
 No the water
 Then for my attack hmm
 Oh yeah Thats uh sorry Thats a
weird little I actually dont have their attack
information still
 Plus what Its a bite attack I know I
dont we havent fixed it yet
 No thats an eight
 For my actual action Im going to put
Im going to use one of my Channel Divinities
 On the water creature just to just for
now Im going to cast the Path to the Grave
 And then thats my turn
 The next person who hits that water thing is
going to hurt
 Im going to undo that
 None of that shit
 Im trying to find it again
 I can cancel that
 And technically its also divinity
 Did the divinity get pulled then from
that
 Kind of Something that nobody
understands yet that I should probably explain to
people at some point
 Oh god Now Im thinking
 I had to
 Thats nasty
 Oh that hits
 Ow
 Im very low well see how this goes
 Nine
 Dexterity saving throw
 Come on Nope
 Yup Im putting it away Im out
 No I havent done the math yet but Im
pretty sure
 Im out
 Guess whos going to be healing
 Youre out youre just not doing death
saves
 Its got to keep stabilizing you I
think
 Yup  Im good
 As long as Laura throws yeah then
 Yes
 Also technically wouldnt my beetles
get a bonus action anyway or
 I thought that was cocked anyway but
yeah
 Dont even Im not rolling another
character
 Aw man yeah
 Its okay I was just hoping for even like
advantage or some such
 Why not
 Hes running a fucking undead
 If Im alive its fine If Im not
alive its not okay
 Okay so its not terrible Its bad
 Whoa
 Mmhmm
 Goddamn it It was so good
 Technically
 It got bigger when we got in here
thats my feeling
 Anything not to go unconscious again
 Not for long
 Yep still alive
 Thats all I needed was just to survive
the round
 And Im out
 I have had nothing I could do this
round
 
 I mean
 So many things need to happen No matter
what were pretty fucked right now This is
terrible
 And make sure youre not going to hit
Jester or I in any of those hits either That will
kill us
 Yeah
 And regardless theres a genie so
 Fucking Algar man
 Thats good Wow Deep
 Im still unconscious
 All right Yeah
  points of health
 Oh
 What is your plan
 Im not up yet Im still in the water
I havent even started to get up yet
 Okay Even if Im underwater
 Yeah okay
 Im already prone
 Oh 
 Okay The first Im going to do is
stuff Sorry Im just getting my shit together
Im going to do Im going to for an action
even before I get up Im just going to cast Cure
Wounds at a second level on Caleb if I can
just
 Is it a touch Oh yeah it is Do I have
a distance one No I do not
 I do Ill do Healing Word
 Ill do Healing Word at a second level
 It autofills so thats  points of
health to you right now
 Im going to turn invisible as my bonus
action and Im going to get up and start moving
away from this mess
 I will just be visible my next turn
 I was going to turn invisible before I
get up but yeah
 There There yeah thatll do
 Yep But theres a lot happening Its
just a  everythings like that
 That was so stressful
 Never too much Ashley
 Were making our way there
 Is everybody okay by the way do we have
every Oh god Im going to cast Turn Undead
 DC on Turn Undead Let me find it
again
 Spell DC is 
 All right lets
 Im going to start a ten minute
 At some point theres going to be a
healing spell
 Does anybody not need healing
 Oh Im getting in on this
 That was what Ive been doing a Prayer
of Healing
 All right so Im doing everybody except
Nott and Im adding Algar to this
 Thats  points to everybody
 
 What were you doing down here
 What is your job exactly
 Especially I imagine if they start
looking into everything you did with that kind of
power I mean having access to that kind of
creature I cant imagine that you were on the
upandup about everything you did
 People have got to have to start asking
questions serious questions
 Im going to pick up the severed hand
and start casting Decompose on it too
 Theyre overinvesting in geniebased
power systems
 Im going to grab the ink too
 Go ahead No
 Im looking for anywhere where there
might be a secret stash or something that looks
offkilter or a little odd in here somewhere
where he might be hiding something
 Six No
 That seems nice
 No you let him live Thats really
nice
 Oh god I Turn Undead
 Yes Its Turn Undead
 Im not quite at the popit Its too
strong for me to pop right
 Well I have a thought
 What if he accidentally lost control of
the creature and then ran
 Ah Turn Undead

 I might be out I was about to say
dont I have I might be out
 Oh yeah no Im out
 Thank you
 Maybe he ran away because doesnt want
to be held accountable for his actions
 He strikes me as the sort of person who
doesnt want to be held responsible
 That might be his attempt to say I did
this Im sorry bye kind of thing
 Well theyre not there are people dead
down there
 Oh god Sacred Flame
 Three points
 I like that just takes responsibility
for everything that happened down there
 Oh thats fair too
 Thats very fair yeah
 Im impressed by the dicks actually
 With his dagger
 Oh he had a quill didnt he
 I think I should go get the boat
 Im going to head towards where we
anchored the boat
 Im going to cast Calm Emotions on
myself and go swim to the boat
 Its no problem I think Ive had enough
ocean for a while That was
 Have a good day
 Ill admit Im a little tired
 That was a lot
 Im going to pull one of the beetles out
of my staff and say Professor you want a
snack I hold it up
 Yeah
 
 Mmhmm
 We can get you a tree costume youll
fit right in
 Ill do that
 Thats a 
 Hmm
 I mean its pretty quiet Other than
that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates
theres really nothing to see
 Its really dark I dont know Other
than that theres nothing really happening
 Are we playing darts
 Thats really useful information
 Yeah
 I wonder how much he paid to bribe the
guard
 Huh
 Well thats a thing You guys see that
 I think somethings happening
 They look like pirates
 Yeah
 Its as if he knew that this would go
horribly wrong
 All worth it now
 This is so badass
 Were we down over there or
 Do we have an iPad for that
 I will roll  No No
 You roll for Laura because I
shouldnt
 Three
 I was about to say we dont have her
iPad
 This is going great
 Thats  nautical feet
 Theres more of them
 Oh boy that is a lot happening
 All right lets yeah thisll be fun
Thats all taken care of Im going to cast a
Guiding Bolt I guess
 Towards the guy standing next to the
guy standing next to Marius
 First level
 Yeah thats a what is the ranged
attack on that
 Yeah no its very far Just a ranged
attack
 to hit
 
 Im at  hit points Im fine Oh yeah
so thats where is that d okay
Ooh  points of damage
 Thank you
 Im going to vanish
 I can do that
 I believe so Im doublechecking I can
do Hidden Step as a bonus action
 Im going to move off in that direction
if thats okay
 Lets go full movement
   Im within  feet of
 None of them Ive got to be them not
Fjord right Okay never mind Ill
doublecheck
 Suffers a critical hit
 Everyone has to pull their weight man
 Theres so many things that could be
going horribly wrong right now
 Yeah Im going to throw a Healing Word
at Beau and Im going to start getting out of
here I want to cast Healing Word Its not a lot
No its  feet
 Thats nice its eight points
 Yeah Im going to start booking out of
here
 Im heading back around the way I assume
everyone else is going Yeah that way
 Guys were going to have problems soon
We should probably get out of here
 Oh no thats right Im not there yet
 Its a shame they never roll that way
when theyre attacking
 Oh thats mean
 Youve got me too Im still spelled up
to all hell
 Whoa
 Hell save every one of us
 Im going to ponder Im going to make
the sound of a bunch of people panicking and
saying Hide everything hide everything
 With Thaumaturgy
 No I thought you can create an
instantaneous sound that originates from a point
of your choice within range
 Thats fair thats fair
 It is listed Im going to make one of
the doors on that boat over there slam shut really loudly
 Im going to run and hide behind the
map Im going off the map around there Yep
 Im going to just be going
 Thatll just be  feet and Im not
running Im walking
 Am I going to be the only survivor in
this Thisll be funny
 Im going to cast Disguise Self Im
going to look like a I seem to recall Im
going to make a composite of the most piratey
Ive decided everyone whos on a boat is a pirate
so Im going to make the most piratey drunken
old man I possibly can Im going to give myself a
big white beard crazy hair very unthreatening
buggy eyes Im going to continue to circle around the
 Im figuring Im going to have to find
you guys at some point but yeah this is Its
the only way I know how to get to the water
so
 I dont have a better way around
 Unless theres a window Unless theres
an open passage on the back of one of those houses
 Oh no thats too
 Thats the best I got right now
 Aw man
 This is a disaster
 Although they havent technically
attacked Oh no
 No theres another guy
 A wacky waver
 Freestyle
 Im going to NPC my ass right across the
street
 Im going to see if I can take my action
and keep going quietly Oh no Im not going
that Im going to go behind those Im getting
in the water
 Yeah Im getting in the water
 Yeah
 Im going to gently get in Yeah Im
sitting in
 Oh is it a tenfoot drop
 All right
 I am very tiny looking right now Come
on Oh my god that was almost terrible Nine
 Theres a lot happening
 Im going to slowly start making my way
underneath everything quietly and with
 Yeah
 Does she know boats
 Why would you say that out loud Whats
wrong with you
 Thats pretty good
 Im swimming full speed directly out
into the ocean
 Oh yeah no Im not having a good
 this is not going well for me Im not
a happy camper
 And I assume that theres some kind of
light on the
 Would I have noticed that before
swimming  feet out
 This could not be more fucked
 Little help here
 Im not doing a voice
 Not having a good day
 Do I have a bonus action
 Im going to do a Healing Word on Fjord
before I start doing another
 Yeah before I start doing another
prayer Im going to cast Healing Word on Fjord
really quickly so
 Thats seven points of hit points
 Im sitting and starting a Prayer of
Healing
 Oh yeah
 That or the AC of Wood
 From It wasnt my intention
 By this point by the way everyone has
 hit points added to their
 A ship a dog an owl a ferret
 Wow I want to say it so bad Im not
going to say it
 Hes doing what he loves best Ignoring
everything else
 Oh man that was a lot
 Thats fair
 I am going to just sit at the front of
the ship wet and Im not in any of this right
 You keep leaving
 I think you might have the right idea
 Yeah Im just going to sit
 I dont know Its been a day Its hard
to gauge
 Yeah
 Im going to be okay
 Ill get up and go down See whats down
there
 Its probably good you didnt pull it
out
 Yeah Im going to tap him on the head
and cast Healing Word at rdlevel
 Thats  points right there
 Well hell be dead eventually Im
going to head back upstairs
 Too real
 Theres at least five jokes in there
 Oh no Im not Just me enjoying a head
wound
 Hey
 I think its been a day
 Miss Jester do you have a plan
 I did I do I did I dont know
  I had a mission a holy
purpose a thing that defined me and I thought
that I was honoring it and now what if I was
wrong This is not what I thought it was going to be
 My home is dying and I thought this
was what I was supposed to do I waited for a sign
and I thought you were the sign and now maybe
there wasnt any sign Maybe I just left and Im
on a ship in an ocean that doesnt want me here
Its been so quiet and
 I always hear things What if I made a
mistake
 And one day will be the last time what
then
 No Although dying was Ive been hurt
before and Ive almost drowning was a lot
 That was a lot and the ocean is a lot and
this is a lot
 
 I think I needed to hear that
Breathings hard 
  It smells really weird
in here
 Its very salty
 Are you hungry
 Im really hungry
 I like cooking I think I need to cook
 Lets go cook Really I feel better that
was actually really nice Im going to go cook
 I live for that shit
 Ive got plans
 How well stocked is this kitchen Is it
stocked at all
 Okay Ive got the stuff in my set as
well so Im going to just
 Were doing some shit This is on
 You know that spicy fruit you can buy on
the side of the road Were doing spicy fruit
 That sounds so good right now Im
genuinely fiending for it
 I think we can bring the bowls up It
doesnt take that long
 Theres bowls Mine mine mine
 I think Im embracing the chaos
 Do you have a plan
 I dont get it but okay
 Thats an answer Thatll do Yesterday
was oh god whats the word
 Heavy Heavys good Yeah
 Well Ive fought animals a few
bandits
 No No that was a first
 Is life always this directionless
 The one with the hair I think shes
going to take off again
 Yeah
 Oh you know how it is Some rocks dont
sit right
 I mean yeah
 Well my job for most of my life was to
talk to people Well it wasnt to talk to people
it was to listen to people Ive listened to a lot
of people
 Yeah Its a graveyard People come and
they talk A lot
 Yeah and you listen a lot I dont know
much but I know people And I know things that
arent people Theres a lot more apparently
 You have to I like that youre looking
for something Thats good
 Well I hope we find it because then
youd get to figure out what to do next and then
therell be two of us who would be wondering
 Im definitely looking out on the ocean
to see if
 Ill do the double yeah Yeah thats
not bad 
 Is that a sign that maybe we should
really leave
 Sometimes its worth owning a mistake
and I think yesterday was a big mistake
 Well by owning it I mean stop trying
to necessarily fix it and let it be a mistake
 And maybe just
 Admit that there might be no fixing
this
 Going to have some thoughts about that
flag too but thats for tomorrow
 Is the flag going to be a problem
 But will they know what the flag looks
like Will that be part of the information that
exists about the ship
 Which is why Im asking you and hoping
you make eye contact with the game
 But the flag is it possible someone
might recognize the flag
 I could dye it
 This is going to go so poorly
 Thats an impressive roll
 And yet somehow theres a dick in the
signature
 Nothing like a bar with withered in the
name
 Were going to need food and supplies
so anything that you think that we might need
Ill go pick that up
 Ill even go so far as to say good food
for a month Im going to bake some shit Fuck it
I also know that I can create food if I have to
so I can do a lot of like base
 I do not have  gold
 Whats adequate food
 Ill do  gold plus Ill up my spice
to make do
 I am a cook
 I look like Shaggy from the special
episode of Scooby Doo where hes pretending
to be a pirate
 Its been awhile I dont know Sorry
 That was totally what I was thinking
about
 We also make them fight and try to kill
each other
 Thank god
 Thats how we do it at home is you
raise your hand
 I see what youre doing and I like it I
like a good ghost story Maybe
 Maybe they saw everybody knows the
legend of the little devil girl who drowned a
hundred years ago
 Every now and then someone reports
about seeing
 Everyone loves a good dock tour Like a
haunted dock tour
 Well I like a haunted tour Ive never
actually been to a dock now that I think about it
 Oh really
 That was all me that wasnt Caduceus
Ugh
 If theres money involved
 Job opportunity
  How are you Im fine
Everybody else is too
 I want to hear you do that voice
forever
 Why do they call it the Inky Claw
 As the crow swims
 Literally cant tell what that is
 I mean I guess I dont know I hadnt
really thought about it
 I guess I dont know Im trying to
reevaluate my expectations I suppose But we have
a direction we have a place to go and stories
are stories
 I didnt really think it through I
hadnt really I thought it would be easier to
figure out
 A sign
 Yeah
 Well when you say it out loud
 I did I yeah
 Yes
 Well thats fair I hadnt really
thought about that
 Were heading towards an island Ive
heard stories Lets go to the island
 There are vegetarian options as well
 Thats all I wanted I can die happy
now
 Perfect
 No please
 Thank you Im very proud of this
Family recipe
 Completely crazy Bonkers
 Oh yeah I mean probably I dont know
I mean Im just barely attached on to this at
this point but I think youre fine
 Worst comes to worst Ill make sure you
can cut and run I think Im stuck here for a
while but Ill make sure you can bugger out if
you need to
 Yeah
 I have no idea what just happened
 You didnt download the app though
didnt you so you didnt hire him
 Im good in my head
 Im going to start probably talking to
fish at some point in the near future
 Ill take it
 
 I dont drink
 Not at all
 Out of idle curiosity why have you been
trying to butter me up
 Well
 I do and for the record Im on board
for now
 Ill keep your boy safe thats okay
 Im not an only child Im aware of how
this works
 Oh yeah
 Theyre somewhere I suppose
 Its just the temple ground thats all
there is to it
 Thats why they left yeah That was the
thought
 No I was the last one left
 Well Ive resigned myself to the thought
that its entirely possible that someone will
 What kind of sign
 Wow I thought I had you figured out
Never mind All right
 NPCs
 Before I go to sleep Im going to
politely ask any of the fish and things that are
in the ocean to let us know if theres trouble up
ahead If they would be so kind
 Im a lunatic arent I Theres just
no
 Okay because I have a roll for this
but Im okay
 I dont know that
 Are we doing  to  still
 
 There we are
 
 That was exciting
 First thing Im going to do is Im going
to cast Im going to get myself into a
reasonable position and Im going to cast where
did it go There it is Calm Emotions In theory
if this is a charm spell and this counts as a
charm if Im correct you can just fail a charisma
save if youd like
 Im going to use Calm Emotions to negate
the charmed effect on Nott and anybody within 
feet of me Actually anyone within  feet of
it Im going to run a few feet away from you
Im going to take my staff and Im going to pull
piece of silverware and bang that crystal Its
going to make a dissonant sound and
wakeywakey
 Charisma saving throw a creatures can
choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes
 Weve got work to do
 Yeah so Im just basically disrupting
that song as long as its within a certain range
for about a minute Im also going to use my bonus
action to wake up the bugs
 The one thats singing Im going to
roll it towards the lollipop
 Snack time
 
 I got to fix this at some point
 I know We just havent had time to fix
anything
 Thats right Thats ooh  points of
damage
 I dont even know what just happened
 Yep
 Yeah Teamwork
 Indoor kid
 It should be right above
 Sure Yeah Theres one thats trying to
get away with one of our deckhands
 Okay Im just going to nuts and bolts
this I dont suppose my insect swarm can attack
for a bonus action
 Well then
 I guess Ill do a Guiding Bolt at level
three
 I just saw you that Im like
 Ah
 Yeah thats  so thats d
  points of damage
 I think so yeah
 But you also have advantage because its
got Guiding Bolt
 I dont understand anything that just
 Im going to go down and let the crew
know that everything seems to be copacetic upstairs
 Hey everything seems to have calmed
down upstairs everything seems fine I think Im
going to try blintzes for breakfast tomorrow I
feel like we could all use a treat
 They dont know what Im making them out
of but yeah
 Not anymore I now have the song Every
Little Piece from Petes Dragon going through my head
 Do we have an empty barrel
 Whatever is left over if you could put
in there and Im going to start something and
hopefully something
 I dont know what Im going to get Ive
never tried harpy before It could be mushrooms
could be anything
 Im going to give it a little zing and
see what I get
 Sure Ill take that
 Ooh thats terrible 
 I just was going to put anything that
was dead now and I was just going to see if I
could maybe start either I dont know what
theyre going to make but Im curious if its
going to be anything I can either eat or use as a
spice
 Im using the Decompose and ferment and
maybe hopefully getting some mushrooms or
something I dont know what harpies make Well
find out
 Yeah if its good I keep it if its
bad I toss it
 Such captaining
 Do we have a mattress or something like
that Do we have anything
 Im going to join you and tie ourselves
off and Im going to also cast Water Walk if
youre into it on
 Im going to give you Water Walk for the
moment because youre probably stronger than I am
I should probably not do this
 Youve got Water Walk
 Theres a suction
 Im going to run down below and all
right fix it Fix it now Got to get it up I
start trying to pull the barrels apart
 Im also going to cast Light in there to
make it super super light
 Is there anywhere that looks like a dock
or anywhere that looks like its appropriate to
 Yeah I am I think thats right 
 How do you want to play this
 Thats another boat Are we making
ourselves known or are we not making
ourselves known
 How far away is the other boat
 Is it possible they havent seen us
yet
 Would it be reasonable to think theyve
seen us by this point
 All right
 Im going to raise the flag
 The blue flag
 I rose it its been risen It is
risen
 Its tough being the smart one eh
 Be bold
 You could technically stand and offer I
might add Since you can actually stand on water
 You can stand on water right now
 We do have his flag up though
 Just the tip
 Oh man
 Weve been having that discussion about
what to wear
 It cant be hard
 I was going to say we could also get
some blue bell bottoms and some Japanese school
tops and fake it
 I dont know what video very
specifically
 Its the pilot
 I know exactly what youre talking
about
 I dont even know how to interpret this
kind of input god First of all I want to see
how many people are in these boats coming in are
they
 Its terrible but Im pretty
perceptive so thats where is that 
 Looks like a jacket
 Oh before they even come up Im going
to look like the ships cook I am not looking
aggressive for this I am putting on a chefs
outfit and getting small and human with awful red
hair so yeah Im out
 I think better together than not
 Cornelius and I apologize for the way
Im dressed right now I was in the middle of
well its obvious I was making a stew this
really nice vegetable stew and everything went
topsyturvy so quick I dont even
 Its very good stew
 Cornelius
 Sometimes they call me Stew because I
 Oh Im very excited
 I dont know Ive got some very
specific burial needs if were actually going to
go that way

 Im unhappy with everything at the
moment I would really like to negotiate some base
points of this deal
 Do I know what a rifle is
 Ah thats cold  Oh thats
really cold Oh ooh
 Does the yogurt come before or after
Really looking forward to that
 Usually
 Jumped right in
 How long are we going to hold these
disguises
 All right
 They need to crew that ship
 No thats okay I wasnt that worried
 Well theyre also fixing the ship At
some point theres two ships
 Thats pretty cool
 Paring knife
 Actually if were going to be getting
ready for some trouble I better change into my
trouble gear if were going there Im going to
drop Disguise Self
 I try not to frighten people but I
figure if were getting messy
 Thank you so much I really like this
whole room I think youve done a really good job
with it This is great
 Ukotoa
 Slow but there
 What are we supposed to be doing
 Sorry sorry sorry
 Strange to others
 
 Yeah
 Like what I dont really
 I was really just listening for that
word because I wanted to play the speak along
game I wasnt really paying that much attention
Im so sorry I got a little distracted in there
That was really fun though
 Actually if we both do that maybe its
like going to be white noise
 All my whispers are just saying that in
different pitches
 Krakotoa Krakotoa Krakotoa
 How many how many how many
 Its technically fourth ball at this
point I think isnt it actually Sorry thats
the face I wanted

 No thats
 This is not an intimidatable person I
mean you can just look
 I think from what little I gleaned I
imagine vanity is the way to play this one
 Yeah I mean some people just want to
talk and I think she just wants somebody to talk
to Thats the vibe I get

 I think Hamilton does win on that one
 The exercise we used to do when I was
taking some theory classes was to describe a car


 If youre thinking about a car and you
imagine a car and you say a car has four doors
four wheels and a windshield Then you drive it
around Well if had two doors is it still a car
Well yeah Well if I removed all the wheels I
cant drive around anymore and it has no wheels
but is it still a car Yeah well if I remove the
windshield and all the doors are taken off and
theres no wheels and an engine is it still a
car
 Well if its just the four wheels is
it a car No

Spellslingers

 What would you do with it
 See and that just a point of a higher
motivation for something I mean theres got to
be a step two
 You cant know what to do until you
understand it I mean thats step one and once
you understand it well try and help you make a
reasonable decision about what to do with it
 Im into it
 I just woke up I dont actually know
whats going on right now
 Did I miss something I dont
 What kind of dreams of a similar
nature
 Hopefully we can fix our Mistake at some
point Thatd be nice Thank you sorry carry on
 We
 Did they have feet or
 I dont remember any of this
 I thought it was like metaphorical that
we were still in the temple and just having some
elaborate like a dream of life and weve all been
in this temple all along and I mean that would
have been really cool although really convoluted
the more Im thinking about it Doesnt make any sense
 Some Treasure Island shit

 Never an accident
 Ill be toward the back I guess
 Yeah might be a good idea
 Im also going to
 Im going to politely ask the local
greenery and let them know that were going to be
coming through and that were going to try not to
disturb them so long as nothing disturbs us
 Yeah have to
 Well I mean I got to talk to a couple
of trees and let them know that were coming through
 Thank god for that plus ten because that
was terrible
 
 Shh
 If you want to hear it you have to
listen for it You hear that
 Whatre you hearing then
 Exactly yeah Its good All right
 Im keeping an eye out
 Oh and Frumpkin
 Im keeping an eye around as well
 It might have been the loss of your
Samsonlike powers
 Sure
 That is a really good idea
 All right
 Well we have a choice here
Youre harder to see I suppose so theres that
 Ill come up with you though
 Im going to poke
up and put my head in as well Theres no trap
doors Nowhere where anybody could be
hiding
 I was just curious
immediately if there was anything I notice I
wasnt going to
 I was going to look around Actually if
youre doing that Ill look around the outside to
see if anybodys watching us
 
 Nothings really watching
 All right
 I dont know Has the bed been slept in

 Yeah
 Sure Im going to take a step back
 Be my guest
 Cherry cherry cherry
 Well thats just sad thats yeah
 I mean thatd be nice wouldnt it
 Yeah Ill see if I can start the muck
going in here and maybe get a nice little
indoor terrarium I dont know what will happen
 Thats already better
 There are some maps in with the compass
just some tools All right
 All right I you know okay
sure We can do that
 Telling who what
 Itd look even better with the golden
snake thing I mean the whole thing comes together nicely
 Magic feather
 Maybe it makes you fly maybe it makes
you molt Theres all sorts of things feathers
could do
 She was really nice
 We didnt look anything alike but yeah
she was very nice
 Im much taller
 
 Are the insects really not bothering him
at all
 Just out of idle curiosity
 Im going to very quickly cast Eyes of
the Grave
 Anything undead within  feet is going
to glow and Im going to get a little glow off
anything that registers as undead
 At some point when I can get to Fjord
quietly at some point
 Natural 
 Im going to crawl up to Fjord in the
line at some point Been keeping my eye out
getting the lay of the land and Jamedi is not
quite alive
 Its not quite alive
 I dont think its an appropriate moment
to bring something like that up but its worth
 Yeah its not quite alive
 If anything I feel like Im exercising
an enormous amount of willpower just not to I
mean just doesnt seem like were in theres a
good advantage to dealing with this now But
yeah theres something weird there
 Oh Im keeping an eye on it Yeah
 That was sort of my fault I apologize
 Bugs How do they work
 Yeah
 Wait Im going to stop you because I
see what youre doing Youre probably not going
to get anything off him but hes got an undead
vibe that Ive been picking up
 I feel you Its been making me pretty
creeped out to be honest but Im trying to hold
together and keep chill Chill Lots of chill
Its hot but
 Youre really going Let me know what
you see and well compare notes later
 Ive got both but its best applied
when needed really Theres only so much to go around
  This is my whisper
voice
 Thats fair Well be in the middle just
in case things go wrong
 Im pretty healy
 If we get into an altercation Ill pop
both of you as quickly as possible
 Yeah this is great
 Ill take one
 
 Ill pop in the occasional lowlevel
Light cantrip as far away from us as possible
just popping every now and then if I think I see
something
 They didnt bring any tents for us
 Mr Caleb want to take a walk maybe
Really quickly around this thing get a gander at it
 Oh then Ill just report back in a minute
 No thats okay better safe than sorry
Ill let you know when I see
 Oh Id love company actually just in
case
 Well take a look around this thing and
I also want to cast another Detect Undead while
were walking
 Im going to take a walk around this
little ruin Im going to have the little Light
spell up see if theres any writing on anything
any carvings Im going to have Eyes of the Grave
up again Im going to be looking for any undead
 You roll too maybe
 
 Couldnt figure what its a temple to
or any
 And nothing from the Detect Undead
 Other than what I already expect to
see
 What I expect to see is still giving off
a little glow right
  feet although I will say divination
magic would also blind me to that and if it was
full cover I would possibly not see it as well
 
 The funny thing is
 Ten
 I mean come on
 And I need to make a constitution saving
throw
 
 
 Im going to yell for help and then Im
going to
 Help Then Im going to tap my staff to
wake up my beetles as my bonus action My beetles
are going to make a bite attack on that I
actually have that information now thanks to the update
 On DD Beyond
 So thats a swarm attack they have a
bite Thats plus three to hit I believe Thats a 
 Okay Thats okay Well theyre in the
space right now Im panicking so this is going
to be fun Im going to start making a weird
awful sound and Im going to start getting even
paler and a little gaunter and Im going to grab
it and Im going to cast Im so panicked
Vampiric Touch
 So since Im in contact with it
 Melee spell attack
 What is a melee attack here
 Okay plus eight 
 Oh man this is mean
 Thats d Thats  ten points
of necrotic damage and I regain five hit points
 Help
 That is unless I can try and move
away
 Im going to try and half my movement to
get up
 Im going to back up against you
 Will he get an attack of opportunity
 Okay perfect That way if you get
poisoned I can unpoison you
 Cool
 Both clerics Why did both clerics go on
a hunting mission
 Yeah were so dumb
 
 Why is it advantage
 Oh goddamn it Yeah that hits
 That also hits
 
 How do you have that spray and the
snakes in the same thats just so much
 Help Im standing
 Im kind of still standing
 It was my own fault I was suspicious
 So theres a stunned one behind me A
stunned one on one side of me and a notstunned
one on the other
 Im going to hit the stunned one with
the Vampiric Touch
 Im at four
 It lasts Thats 
 That was close Seven points of damage
So I get three back
 So now I am at seven hit points Now Im
going to vanish Im going to disappear
 Im going to turn invisible
 Yeah Im going to circle around and
back off Yeah Then take a couple steps back See
if anything happens
 That misses
 Im going to get a little further out
Im not going to go off the board or anything
Thats fine
 
 Im going to gather in and keep an eye
out before I come back into visual Im about to
become visible again
 Are we what
 Uh
 Thank you Im going to Cure Wounds
 Yeah
 Ill start them going too so that wont
be a thing for very long
 What
 No need to yell thats all right
 We were just looking at the temple
trying to get an idea of what it was
 Yeah that may have been a poor call
 I definitely feel like Ive learned I
think I need to pass out
 One ounce owl Its the best band
 All right
 Yeah
 Wolfstar is a total space cowboy
 Thank you wolfstar
 Please tell me youve got Pass Without a
Trace up
 Thank you
 Are you even here
 
 Whos got the mote this morning Who

 I dont know oh

 Oh yeah Im feeling fine
 Why
 You seem a little
 You sure
 I can do a
 Does she look okay
 
 You dont look okay Are you sure you
really dont look okay
 Well
 Im just offering something medicinal
 No
 Youre clammy and
 Hold on
 You should take this
 Take a look at this just want to take a
look Smell it does it smell bad
 Its a clever distraction Im touching
her and casting Lesser Restoration Dont think
Ive never done this before
 I apologize Thats weird though
 You really dont look okay Just for
fun really quickly
 Just out of curiosity one check for
undead really quickly
 No
 Does Eyes of the Grave show anything
here
 Okay
 All right I did what I can Does it
seem contagious
 You joke but like a third of our people
are down Its very empty out there
 Too much for me
 Yeah just be careful what you touch for
a little while we need
 But without you theyre not going to be
as sneaky We have to stay together if were going
to want to be super stealthy
 Together probably is better
 Or for that matter if we cant speak to
them
 Stealth with a couple emergency backup
snake looking people
 We all have to move together
 Thats if they see us
 If they dont see us it doesnt matter
what they look like
 Specifically he was not telling you
because I knew you were going to panic
 I just know things I dont know what it
means I was trying to find a moment to figure out
if you knew or if we should tell you or if this
was part of some sort of plan I hadnt figured it
out and for some reason I had not realized that
I was walking around with a bunch of gossips
Well its what I get I suppose for trying to be
sneaky about things
 Ive been doing my best not to be thrown
by it It seems like hes been standing up all right
 This is why I was trying to keep it on
the downlow
 I knew that certain members of the party
may get a little excited I myself had a moment
of panic Had a moment of panic myself Ive been
keeping it contained
 No theres a dead guy walking around
with us Thats unsettling Thats unsettling to
my very core Ive got to admit but you know
 Its an improvement at the very least
 How many fingers am I holding up
 Oh I forgot to Im really distracted
right now I dont know why I bother
 Mmhmm
 
 A most expeditious movement towards the
temple I suppose would be the
 Im going to walk forwards first to peek
in because I look like a snake
 All right Thats terrible 
  Sacred Flame
 Back door
 Im going to quickly grab two arrows
from one of the dead lizards and stick them in his
chest and Im going to walk out I want to go
yeah
 Hey
 It makes a grab for her
 Blindness Im going to blind him before
he grabs her
 Constitution 
 Ah god
 
 I mean
  Somethings out
there
 Everybody
 
 Oak mahogany rosewood
 Does it look like a trap door to me
 All right
 I got a 
 Okay And it doesnt look like it
moves
 Lets get in Were all going to get in
Come on
 Ill join this one as well
 
 So I keel over mysteriously dead Just
kidding Sorry No all right cool
 Im closing slowly
 Whos rubbing my elbow Its weird
 Oh yeah thats so true
 Tomorrows a long day
 Deep in the single digits over here
 This is a cleric thing
 The windup
 These are Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom villains
 It means they hurt
 A lot of things It means that they
could actually do damage to us possibly They
could be glass cannons
 Were probably about to find out
 No I was following your lead
 Are you in the single digits or double
 Prone still means youre disadvantage
no they have advantage
 Im going to shake it off a little bit
Im going to
 Yeah Ill stand up Im going to back
into the corner
 Im going to use my bonus action to
just No Im not going to bother with that for
now Its not really going to If you go down
you go down at this point
 No healing Im going to do is going to
keep you from going down if you get hit by a
triple I can just get you back up
 
 Im going to do a Whered it go These
are cantrips Healing Word on Beau
 I mean Eight points of healing
 Im going to hold the Channel Divinity

Path to the Grave spell for Yasha
 Mmhmm Right as Yasha starts to move
Im going to
 You dont know Its going to make Yasha
boss
 Im going to cast Channel Divinity on
the angry snake in armor
 Yes
 Hot I needed that today thank you
 Thats also a ramp isnt that harder
terrain to get up there
 Denied
 It uses a reaction for that Thats
bullshit
 Yeah
 Im very curious to see how this is
going to go I just want to look her over What is
this room What is happening What was going on
 
 
 Priestess of Zehir what was this place before you
found it
 Do you know its name or are you 
afraid of it
 As Im large goofy grin Im
going to start touching one of the other
priestesses and Im going to start the
process
 Dont mind that
 Cure Wounds
 I dont know can I Or is it too
 Fair All right I was wondering if I 
was pushing this too far
 Yeah Oh man Dexterity check Oh no
Eight
 I obviously do cast the spell dont I
 Can I start
 Thats cheating
 Doesnt seem very helpful
 Im going to start poking around some of
this Is this attached to the walls
 Im going to talk to the moss
 Im going to ask the moss to make sure
you have a very comfy sleep do what they can You
guys take care of that one
 No Beau is definitely not feeling okay
 Is there sign of blood in or around the
fountain or in any of the grooves Im seeing if
the blood makes it all the way down here
 Thats 
 Anywhere where theres moss am I
finding these matching holes
 Ugh Ten
 Im thinking about plugging these holes
 Dont do that
 How many points down are you right now
 We can both use
 Wait what can you turn into stone
 Thats not a bad idea
 We could do that with we have its a
little morose but weve got some dead people
 Lets definitely check those bodies
 You can take it
  Seven days
 I would love to take a last look at the
snake iconography and the bits that have been
added to see how well I dont want to fudge them
or anything but wheres there a keyhole Are
these things attached to the wall Whats the
deal
 Oh man it would be Eight
 Im worried about what that might do I
dont know This is obviously an older temple than
theyre giving it credit for which means theres
probably things here that are older than snakes
 Yeah
 I dont know Ive never tried
 No its perfectly fine to stack graves
Its actually very efficient Its a great way of
using if you have a limited amount of space Over
time you eventually end up doing that Thats
common practice
 Yeah apparently they do that
 Can we understand any of these glyphs
Is there anything that
 I dont think we want the water to go
into the ground
 I already tried and it didnt happen
 Or its just mean
 I just suck as a healer
 Did you take it with food or did you
just put it in your system
 Thats a very nice paintbrush
 It doesnt look weird Its just algae
right
 Does this seem like the stuff thats in
these people Ive seen several heads come off and
Ive got samples of it available to me
 Including the crazy dude The one that
was super
 And this is not that
 So were looking for a keyhole
 Lets assume that bad things are going
to come out of these holes at some point
 I have thoughts I dont know
 I mean if I were going to make snake
people Id put them in a room with snakes and Id
have a way of calling the snakes when its time to
start changing those people into snakes
 Maybe the blood sacrifice is what lets
them know its dinner time
 Yeah but I think theyre going to
yeah you got it I think weve got to move this
fountain
 What do I know about this god About
this snake god
 Lets let that inform us as we figure
out which of these socket the gems go into
 Do we want to do all three at the same
time
 Oh well thats fair
 Can we throw a little light down there
to see if anything tries to bite at it
 Im making an athletics check Ten
 Im going to let the trees know that
were here
 Im going to let the trees Im not
going to touch the tree but Im going to walk up
I dont know the last time you had people in here
but were going to try and pass through If you
want well take some fruit if you want the fruit
to leave the chamber If not well try and do our
best to leave it be We respect your space here
 Cool
 Does this look or smell like anything
those people eat
 I dont see how those things are
noninterchangeable
 Its like I got a lemon tree
 Yeah Fjord
 How are you all drinking What is it
that you live off of How is this possible in
here Im going to quickly out of fear cast Eyes
of the Grave one more time
 Yeah all right
 These are carnivorous Are the trees the
same color as the blood of these creatures
upstairs Is it a similar
 I think theyve been feeding these
things
 Is there any signs of animal life in
here Is it any more complex of an ecosystem I
feel like Im missing something
 I think its for fruit collecting
 I think maybe you should draw what you
see
 Yeah thats an interesting question
 Why dont you have the owl see it and
maybe you could see through the owl
 Or you could just eat that
 I am going to sit on unbelievably high
alert and this place is giving me the heebie jeebies
 Im making my own light source on the
staff now
 The old serpent
 I imagine they are speaking of the
previous owner of this temple
 Probably Beneath us
 We are the warden right now
 Weve got two wardens
 This is what Im estimating
 Im going to take a look
 Youre making a terrible mistake Stop
Please
 Is it wet in here or is it dry in here
would you say
 Out of curiosity
 Can I use Create or Destroy Water to try
and dehydrate these vines really badly
 I am going to cast Create or Destroy
Water and try and dehydrate as much of the tree
and see if that While I make my way to some
higher ground
 Okay Cant pull it from a creature
 I would know that Okay Im going to
try and god the only thing I can think to do at
the moment is just do a Sacred Flame to try and
get it to let go while I make my way to higher
ground because maybe we need to give it blood I
dont know
 
 Badesque
 Hulk smash
 I can sometimes influence plants Im
going to try and get them to stop
 Im going to try to tell the trees to
stop
 Were not here for you Let go and stop
this or I cant be held responsible for what
happens to this place Do not join the cycle of
life and death here
 Do I get advantage
 An intimidation check
 All right No Wow thats a terrible
roll and a terrible roll Seven No no eight
 Thats okay Im going to use my bonus
to cast Spare the Dying anyway on Nott Youre stabilized
 Darn it
 Last turn
 Just need to get Nott to higher ground
 To higher ground would be nice Anywhere
where we can see clearly
 I just do we know where were going
yet
 Are we still being attacked by these
things
  Happily
King
 
 Are we taking ten minutes or are we
just moving on now
 Well all right then Im going to just
pull a little energy out of the crystal and Im
going to tap Nott on the forehead and cast Cure
Wounds at level three
 You have  hit points
 Thats good to know too
 Im going to inspect these two plants
If theres anything that would have been difficult
to get to past these two plants I feel like maybe
those are the they might be 
 Im going to cast some Im going to
use my light maybe to give everybody a little view
 Knee bone connected to the
 Posthaste Possibly
 North
 The warden garden
 South
 Ill take a look
 Can I 
 Im going to keep some distance to see
if anything snaps at me
 Ive gotten a little jumpy Not very
good 
 Can I get a sense of the sort of animal
that wouldve laid
 Yeah this is the south fountain feeds
the
 Also can I figure out being in here do
we have any idea how those portholes those four
portholes up above would feed into this room
 How healthy does that egg look
 Theyre lizard eggs arent they
 Mmhmm How healthy oh yeah
 Yeah theres some reptile large
reptile eggs in the
 It appears to be a hatchery of some
kind
 Yeah Ill take a look to see if
 God these are terrible 
 It could be where once the eggs hatch
they come up or this is how they get the eggs
down this is a nesting area All right whats
the west side really quickly
 Oh thats better 
 No but I think it keeps going down I
think they just never quite sealed it up
 Theyre not expecting problems and they
dont seem that bright
 I guess well take a quick look at north
just to finish things off
 
 Is it possible to tell if these eggs
might hatch anytime soon or are they thats left
of them
 All right Lets do that My nature is
terrible which is ironic But I rolled a natural
 so that should do
 Is this true Both look similar both
seem
 Theres probably no direct danger
leaving these things untouched for now I think
weve found a way down there at the very least
 How big is the entrance into that
little unfinished
 Does it seem like its separating from
the rock even a little if I take a look at it
from the side
 Aw man Low intelligence Thats a 
 Throw some light in there
 Im going to keep trying see if theres
anything that connects to anything
 Ill grab a couple of the fruit that
were on the ground and put them in my pocket
 Put the high people in the middle
maybe
 Ill be in front of you just so we have
a cleric on either end
 Five
 Oh thank god
 Got a brand new map got a brand new
map
 She doesnt see the other side of it
 I can do one
 Whos going to take it
 Poison resistance
 All right Im going to cast Protection
from Poison on Beau
 Level two You have advantage on saving
throws against being poisoned and you have
resistance to poison damage
 That hurts
 I apologize for this I dont think it
needs to see Im not even sure if it really do
I know how snakes
 It probably can see in the dark
 I think that we need to stay far away
from this thing I think we need to get its shield
away from it
 Wizard and cleric in the back
 Simultaneous
 Hey
  Is that just straight
 No
 Yasha got to roll too
 Although that will be good because if I
go right before Yasha That means that I can
 Oh that power of mine doesnt work as a
big simultaneous smush its just one attack but
I have to choose which attack that it
 Yeah I still keep my reaction
 Oh no
 Wow Im going to give you a quick pop
since you could use a little bit of
 Youre welcome I cant keep doing that
Just a quick Cure Wounds really quickly
 Where are my ds Thats not a d Ah a
d Thats nine points of damage
 Yeah my bonus actions not a lot I can
do with my bonus actions at the moment
 For my bonus action Im going to cast a
Light spell on the other side of the wall really
quickly so that we have some light in this
 Yeah Just on one of the columns
 Then Im going to take some cover
 Oh its an action never mind cant do
it
 Okay well Im going to hide
 Im going to pull in the back and hide
 Yeah just around the corner so I cant
get hit by a bow Im going to advise you do the
same eventually
 Weve already done some damage Hes
about to take more damage
 Theres a bubble
 Oh my god
 Isnt it technically a sneak attack at
this point
 I thought you did rage as a bonus
action Damn it
 Thats so cool
 Im going to run out into the room I
want to run out Can I see both of these creatures
 How far would I have to go to see both
of them
 Shit Ill just see one of them then
 Im going to cast Bane
 Thats a  charisma
 All right you know what Bane does
 I can tell you You have to roll a d
for every attack or saving throw You roll a d
and you subtract that from what you get
 I dont even think it is concentration
 Is it
 Theres no C on this thing Oh there
it is Never mind Im an idiot
 No Im going to hide back in
 Yeah
 I was going to say would you have spent
that spell Would she have been able to spend that
spell If she couldnt
 Nevertheless she did
 Smart
 They need the d and at disadvantage
Ive never used Bane I should really start using Bane
 Bane
 Yeah
 You doing okay
 Theres a d negative also
 Also the little
 Avantika and
 Which you are
 Fuck you hydra
 Oh That a fuckers oh Okay Things
can still go wrong
 And the other one
 That went well
 Jester you first
 No reactions none of them
 I mean no because I mean 
 Its good that we burned those two
actions for that I feel like that was a good use
 That wouldve been
 That was about as disappointing
 If youve ever had fluffernutter thats
about the flavor of it
 Yasha are we Im going to yell down
going peek out and cast my Path to the Grave
before Yashas turn on the hydra
 Its now vulnerable to everything The
next hit is double damage Its what we did last
time Next hit is double damage Im back to
hiding
 Just plow
 So autoadvantage
 Its okay its still holding
 You still have it though
 She can also back off without
repercussions
 Is that a natural  against you
 Oh Can I see from my vantage or can I not
 How are you feeling
 All right thatll do The problem is
the fucker behind you
 Minus
 Technically isnt it flanked right now
too
 No we can Oh not on that side of
things but you see the other side
 Its wet
 Unless it cracked from throwing it
 Oh yeah Im getting nervous Got to
admit Im getting nervous Im running out of
cool shit to do
 There we go
 If its a natural  then the Bane
doesnt even matter
 Yeah the  is the only thing you can
roll with a Bane that would definitely have no effect
 We need a fire
 No Im going to
 Oh no he doesnt have fucking
 Im going to pop my head up and I think
Im going to back against the wall so that I can
actually see whats going on for now because Im
starting to get nervous Im going to use my bonus action
 Yeah Fuck man Im also going to look
at that undead motherfucker in the corner and
 Pull your weight I hate lazy people
You found one of my buttons Im going to do a
bonus action Healing Word on you Its not a lot
 Eight points of healing
 Then Im going to use my other I can
do this twice Im going to use Path to the Grave
again The hydra has a problem one more time

the hydra
 Once and this is now my second because
it resets after a short rest
 Is that including the
 Did you also do the thing where the

cast Spirit Guardians at level three I just tap
my staff and a bunch of creepy little glowing
fairies start flying around me Thats a wisdom 
save Minus d
 Just need a two
 Im so sorry I wouldnt have dropped
the Bane then Im so sorry I didnt see that it

plan

do originally which is Im going to do a level
three Guiding Bolt
 Thats fine
 Please Whats the plus to this
 Where is my spell attack

 No bonus
 Im an idiot
 Roll for balls
 That explains a lot
 Thats nice
 Thank you for not shooting it in the
pool because that might have killed you
 Beau would have taken an automatic death
saving fail
 Large groups of enemies its a great
idea
 Yeah
 In theory
 I assure you its safe now
 Is Jamedi wearing any weapons
 Actually Im going to use this new d
and see how that goes
 The con Ah Thats good Thats a good
start 
 Im going to cast Detect Magic
 On everything Including our friends and
everything in the room
 Nothing Jamedi is wearing at all is
giving off a
 Mr Fjord I feel like I should mention
Im keeping a lookout for anything and Im getting
a bit of a magical aura from the three columns I
dont know if its related to this
 The three columns are very similar

 Did I lose all my hit points when I went
unconscious
 Okay I had zero then Well fuck
 Im going to cast really quickly since
I have nothing else left Im going to cast
Disguise Self and look like one of the lizard
people
 Oh no
 Ill use Thaumaturgy to create the sound
of a rushing group of us but throw it
happening Im going to move us off into the
jungle in the other direction You can create
instantaneous sound that originates from a point
of your choice within range This is a rumble
within  feet a rumble of thunder
 I cant make it the cry of a raven
such as is what it says
 Im making the sound of people rummaging
through
 Yes Im pushing it away from us and
moving us in that direction
 Come on man not some sucky stuff Ah
Not bad 
 Ill take just barely today
 I have something else but Id be
curious if somebody else has something
 My favorite saving throw
 
 Certainly not the weirdest
 Ive already done that as well
 
 Oh fuck really
  she was  Ten
 I yeah
 I have the ability to carry a large
amount because of my size can I piggyback and not
get too much of a roll if I throw Caleb on my
back
 Okay
 Oh man
 Ill have Ya yeah no thats a better
idea because I was five hit points maybe not
 
 Oh my god
 Oh thank god
 Yeah Im just
 This is yeah That was a lot

 Its only a teacher if we actually learn
from these mistakes
 I have a giant pile of stuff in the
other room
 Can we ever not look
 Yeah
 I would be amenable at this point
 Theres more than one There was more
than one creature
 We need three onyx eyes three ivory
eyes three amber eyes
 A creature of the sea a creature of the
air with fire
earth
 I think the question really is what
were going to have to do about this I mean this
is the direction that were heading This is
whats being put in front of us I dont know if
running headlong into the next temple is the best
option I think maybe if you didnt find the
answers you were looking for down in the water
maybe its time to look somewhere else
 All things considered I think it would
be best if we left on good terms
 Lets get to port and restock and
thats when well figure out
 I dont know
 Perhaps some sign of agreement to share
information with the understanding that youre
both working towards the same goals and maybe it
would be better to have two groups doing this
instead of one
 Shes already said that shes sent
people out to do this work It wouldnt be that
much different I suppose
 As opposed to what
 To be honest it would be worth actually
following through with it anyway She knows things
that we dont We get to find out
 Thats true
 Is this some sort of pirate town
 Jesters carving something into the bow
of the boat and we dont know what Shes got the
axe and shes moving it in a direction without
looking
 Are we now going to go and sleep and
properly sleep
 I think Im going to go to sleep I
dont know about the rest of you Im going to pat
him on the shoulder and just for fun cast
Protection from Poison
 Youve got an hour
 I dont mind it I think I just have an
issue with the things that are in it and being
under it and Im going to go to sleep and probably
yeah throw up a little
 I cant leave yet
 Were going to figure out a way for you
to breath underwater Its going to be okay
 Come on
 A long rest
 Im very mixed about this whole thing
 I have a passive perception of 
 Can I figure out what happened just by
looking at him
 Sleep well with your bad decisions
 Rolling a d right
 Six
 Stop fighting a success
 What do I get at level seven
 I already gave my shade Im done
Honestly that was all I needed
 Oh Im in my room because I was is
this before Fjord came back
 Okay so Im in my room
 Hey Mister Caleb Good evening
 Battered
 Sure What can I do for you
 Oh yes Of course
 I think Im coming to the realization
that perhaps I was not entirely clear on what I
signed up for but I dont think that means that
its the wrong path Im getting used to the idea
that it wouldnt be a test if it were easy
 I I joined your group of friends I guess
our group of friends now as a testament of
faith and it would be a disservice to that faith
to turn around because its hard If itd have
been easy I suppose I wouldnt have been needed
to be called to it Ive been thinking a lot about
it Jester gave me a lot to think about to be
honest
 Mister Caleb do you believe in fate
There are lots of different kinds of fate I know
thats a heavy question but do you believe that
we are driven towards something by things that are
greater than ourselves

 There are times that I think about the
cruelties of the world and the things that have
been put upon me and my family and I would hate
for that to be a plan and there are times when
like today Im very grateful for being in the
right place at the right time to make sure that
the right people are becoming strong in ways they
need to be I dont think that excuses the pain I
dont think that you have to I dont know I
dont think that you have to not care about it or
fight it with everything youve got but I think
the world is shaping you into something important
and I want to make sure that you get to wherever
you need to be
 You wont have to work very hard at it
I imagine I think just being you wherever the
world puts you will do just fine
 I can tell
 Thank you
 I promise I will continue to help you
all Even when were not the best of people I
feel like were still moving towards something
thats good and worthwhile and Im feeling the
struggles in my way to bring us to where we need
to be
 Im honored
 Thank you for this I wont forget it

 Meanwhile one hour later
 Im adding which item
 intones theme from Pirates of the
Caribbean
 I have a thing called Create Food and
Water
 We can mix it up with the normal food so
it doesnt taste as bad
 Teamwork
 So sorry We just burned an entire
encounter like Yeah Fuck whatever Matthew made
 I was about to say anything like being
able to go by the stars or otherwise is something
I might be able to do very well
 Fair
 Just lording that rap battle over me
Okay thats fine
 I was thinking the one where you
actually have to go out and find supplies I might
be really good at that
 Yeah Ill take the boatswain
 Some stuff that we dont want to get rid
of
 Yeah
 Oh yeah I like it up there
 A boatswain
 May I
 Im going to take a look at this thing
 
 Obviously the decision is yours but we
are low on supplies which means we have more to
lose If something goes wrong we lose vital
members of our crew or burn through magic ability
Were going to be without food whereas Im sure
theyre probably very well stocked and prepared
for these sorts of eventualities I feel like we
would be coming in from a place of weakness
Thats my initial thought
 Fine art
 I think that escalated rather quickly
 Well I said that we were in a position
of disadvantage
 I feel like this is somehow connected to
your previous bad decisions
 In my imagination that felt vaguely like
a threat
 What does the flag look like
 All right
 Powder ball make ready fire
 Im so excited
 At least you werent looking in it
 We are apparently committing an act of
piracy
 Do we have a name of this ship
 Do you want me to make an announcement
maybe
 Thaumaturgy Im going to project my
voice very loudly onto the other ship
 Fellow friends at sea we wish to have a
parlay with your captain and we hope to keep this
entire confrontation as bloodless and reasonable
as humanly possible We will do our best to be
civil and not encourage anything inappropriate
over the next several minutes We would appreciate
your cooperation in this direction Then Im going
to try and make all the doors open and available
to us from the other ship with Thaumaturgy as
well Im going to pop all their doors open
 What number is that I have a number in
that lets see what it does Thats a 
 Definitely food and water We are also
in the need of some gems if possible Ill also
say that if they require any healing at all for
anybody that might be sickly on the ship Id be
happy to offer my services
 Im by the way human looking right
now
 Smeed
 Let us know if you need anything
 Dont get greedy
 Just because everyones on the deck Im
going to do a quick Detect Magic and scan the boat
 Everybody in the boat
 I will also say Im going to take it and
that chest they just threw out as well
 Its foot Okay at the very least
Im going to get close and walk the Oh yeah
 Theres something magic down below
 Im getting a little bit of magic down
there I dont know what it is but its making me nervous
 Oh god
 That sounds like the worst thing ever
Oh man
 This is the darkest timeline Oh
 And thats how I got this
 Im having bad flashbacks
 Vampire
 You want to send me down
 All right
 Im going to start heading downstairs to
see what the commotion is
 Yeah hed pat you a couple times
 Yeah I probably am getting down
 Whoa Wow Someone did a number on you
 I might do both of you Hi Its a
pleasure to meet you I get the feeling youre
having a really bad day
 Im going to do a little healing spell
down here so everyones feeling a little better
Im going to start doing a little healing on both
of you Take a few minutes while you
guys figure this out
 Prayer of Healing on both of them
  points up for you  points up for
him
 I still by the way have my Detect
Magic up Am I getting anything
 So I would have had it when I came in
 Oh is that box glowing
 By the way I suppose I would have said

That box is definitely magic Id be very careful
with that Yeah lets be gentle with it Was it
Soma Mr Soma
 How did you get this gig I was just
curious
 I mean do you work for anybody or do
you have a deal with somebody Do you like who you
work with Seems kind of a rough gig
 Thats fair This is just odd I mean I
imagine being sent with something I didnt know
anything about by godknowswho that will leave a
mind to wander I dont know
 Yeah you know I would

 Sort of a reluctant piracy at the
moment
 We like everybody to walk away feeling
as okay with everything as possible
 Yeah obviously it is magical by the
way
 How trapped is it
 So is the magic not coming from the box
Or what was inside the box
 Lets get some distance here
 I mean you got to admit I bet youre
pretty curious whats in there
 Keep everybody okay Im going to get a
little distance and Im going to go outside the
room just in case Mr Fjord I would recommend
you get some distance as well
 Mr Caleb is going to maybe want to take
a look at that later I would recommend hiding it
 I feel really bad about this Can we
throw him any money or something
 I think we wont mention to anybody that
we threw you a little cash I mean obviously
that doesnt need to travel and you know
whatever you need to do to maintain I understand
dignity is a thing
 Actually if you like we can walk out
Too much
 I feel like we should leave these people
with most of what we I think this has been
enough I dont want to you know cause any more
trouble than we have
 Anyone else need some healing Anything
real quick
 I know Im dying
  Captain Cupcake
 Sorry too much Reeling it in
 Wow
 So weird
 Did we keep the sword I dont
remember
 Start doing a little more healing on
you
 Im going to head down obviously tired
and just go follow you guys to take a nap
 Im keeping a close eye on whats going
on this is very theyre being so sketchy
  That tickles
 Thats a novel
 Trecorum Satis Dee Youre welcome
  Not there
 He had it in the tattoo and the coat
yeah
 I was about to say you can roll a d
and if you roll a  Ill tell you what Molly
would have thought
 This is some Bugs Bunny shit
 Oh yeah
 How did you not think this through This
was inevitably where this was going
 Fields of phalli
 It would be a really big you would
have a tiny boat
 Then wed be a raft in the ocean
 That would take a long time though
 Were heading to port regardless I
figure at some point
 I figure things dont change regardless
as long as were on the ocean
 The things it makes are not
 I have good news
 your favorite chewing
gum
 Rope
 I have a shield Do you need a shield
 Can I take a look at that thing maybe
 Whats your AC again
 Yeah I really like my shield though
but this is interesting
 No
 This would push it to  All right
 All right
 Fair
 I may just for my own personal
aesthetic try and mount my beetle wings onto
this but I like it Ill do that later
 Youll have to add it
 In the meantime its just plus one to
my AC How many attuned items can I have
at this level
 Three all right
 Better than sinking dicks I suppose
 This may actually give you wait what
is your AC bonus to your shield
 This would actually this doesnt give
me an  this just keeps me at  because I was
already at a  with my shield
 Oh okay so right now its only giving
me a 
 Maybe I havent oh never mind now
its working there we go I hadnt attuned it
 A little gaudy for my tastes but Im
going to do a little work to it
 Prefer not to make a habit of that
 Youre hard to follow sometimes you
know that
 Ah nothing just
 Or three
 Ive been paying very close attention
and listening in to the hallway and trying to keep
a very
  
 Havent heard any footsteps or
 I feel like for the time being it just
might be best to be the best we can be here and
be as helpful as humanly possible Our goals are
relatively aligned and as long as we dont have to
hurt anybody Im all right But the rest of these
people
 Always
 Well when we want to find the ship I
think I might be able to help
 What No I mean no Definitely not
 Yeah no I really dont think I have
anything to add to that I think youve been doing
just fine
 I think I might be able to help you find
the ship
 I dont understand what any of this is
anymore
 I thought Oh about finding the ship
thats all
 Im going to take a nap Taking a short
rest
 Blow me into Bermuda
 Black pepper
 You could make a sneeze arrow in
theory
 
 Beautiful
 Complicated feelings
 He got away quick yeah that was not a
good time
 Nope
 That was really good Do me
 I like juice
 I mean to be fair we should let us go
home eventually
 Lets make sure the crew knows that they
should be repairing the ship and we need to be
shipshape at some point
 This is golden age of piracy Barbados
basically Were in the thick of it
 Oh wow okay
 This is nice
 They call me Clay
 I serve nature Im a maker of fine
graves
 We did Oh yeah
 We should take our leave
 Thats metal
 Thats some metal shit
 Can tell youre a snitch Can tell at 
feet Of course youre a snitch

 You are
 You sit in the bathroom stall with your
legs raised with a notebook
 Very Its lush
 I will follow
 I am so proud of you all
 The Plank King is cool
 You got a participant trophy
 Well We should take a look around
maybe get a sense of this place since were going
to be here for a while when they fix the ship I
have a few things Im looking for
 We could do that sure I guess
 Shes a Heather
 Ill stand
 How many of them are true believers
Give or take
 Im terrible at these
 
 Is there anybody whos awkwardly into
it but definitely would probably walk away if
they could Is there anybody whos a little
 Thatll do
 Shattered Teeth whats the Shattered
Teeth Did your teeth shatter Is that a place
 Oh
 I could fill a book with what I dont
know
 You didnt even ask him if theres a
bookshop nearby
 Thats two punches taken away
 Its like someone ordered a special at
an extremely expensive tiki bar
huh
 Thats why I have my tiki mug today
 Im looking for a blacksmith actually
as well
 Somebody worth their salt since worth
your salt is a really nice term Thats great
Worth their salt Somebody worth their salt
 Its worth my salt
 Oh I dont know I havent really
thought about it at all now that I think about
it Thats a good question I mean theres so
much salt around to be fair It would probably
take a lot of salt to be worth something
 I mean you could get it right out of
the water
 Everything is worth its salt at that
point really Its a terrible currency
 Has anyone been watching me drink
 I have been nursing the same cup the
entire time and have been fakesipping it the
entire night I havent actually had a drop
 Whatever they handed me Ive been doing
this to be fair the entire time weve been together
 Not Heather Make a note
 A fisherman
 Heres a cube Have a cube
 Theres a cube
 Im hoping this is a place where
somebody named Rachel Diver may have bought a
piece of land or something
 I was waiting for him to go Bill
Murray
 Damn
 Whats Allison been up to
 That sounds like a great idea
 What should we be looking out for Is
there some sort of natural dangers unnatural dangers
 Oh thats a bad roll
 
 Outside
 Im going to get some air
 Maybe that is better
 I went out Im standing by the front
door bouncerlike and trying to get my bearings
take a look around see what the vibe of this
place is
 Where are you guys talking
 Oh never mind
 Ill have to secure the things
 Im sitting out front Im doing the
door
 I think Im doing all right Im just
contemplating where were going from here
 I am a little more at ease
 Ive only gotten drunk once in my life
 And that was because of Nott
 I thought Id try It didnt agree with
me
 Everything hurts and its violently
offensive to the body on every level That stuffs
disgusting Just awful
 Well it feels polite and not everybody
is as understanding as your friends you know
 I just sit in the corner and I listen to
everything that I can for as long as I can and it
got a little noisy in there and thought Id get a
little air
 Oh yeah This place is dangerous Shes
dangerous
 I think thats a good idea And Fjord
You know why everybodys doing this Why were all
here right
 I think you know it I just want to
point it because that woman she doesnt care what
any of us want Im sure shed be interested but
its way low on her priorities and I dont trust
anybody who puts other peoples needs that low on
the list and you should keep mind of that while
youre getting in bed with them so to speak
 Nope
 What part of the body is the amigos
 Okay
 Amigos We share amigos
 Thats even better
 I think I get it Im not going to talk
out of turn and I trust your intentions so
 Youre asking if I can tell youre
conflicted
 Youd be amazed but all right
 Sure Im so glad you put it that way
Youre a good man Fjord so be careful because I
imagine its a little out of character being
honest and truthful with somebody in a deceptive
way It can muddle a good man up whereas it
doesnt muddle a bad man up
 Thats one of the reasons why I like
you
 Here for you man Ive been learning to
swim
 Oh two are mysteriously vanished I
think they were mumbling something about trying to
find an alley
 We dont take that long I think 
minutes is
 Release
 Thats where youre supposed to go
god
 I love you so much You give so much

 I want to take a night walk
 The crew should also have some place to
sleep Lets make sure everybody is taken care of
 Theyre having a bad time what do you
guys want
 Mr Orly we feel terrible about
everything thats going on We want to make you
guys as comfortable as possible through this
deeply inconvenient situation weve all found
ourselves in
 Appreciate your honesty
 What would not be an insult
 Like that I know that would be an
insult but what would not be an How many kids
are here
 Without question
 Thats a good idea
 Thank you kids We are unless
something goes tragically wrong we expect to be
returning and I imagine youll hear word if
things go tragically wrong
 How long do we expect to be gone for
 If its two weeks the ship is yours
 I appreciate that Hopefully you will
not have to play a funeral dirge for us
 Thats fair
 Whats a mermaid
 How many teeth does a mermaid have
What is that
 Those are both very dangerous
 Any idea how long ships have been going
down in that region
 Thank you for your time and thank you
for your trust
 Working on it
 Lets take a walk Lets see what there
is to see Im excited about this
 Yeah
 Like a teacozy A swordcozy
 I caught a bit of that right
 Actually I have to stop really quickly
and use the bathroom Theres these little
outhouses over in the corner right here that drop
straight down into the
 Yeah Its like the tower bridge
 Its the tip of the tiny Tiffany Ship
 Which ones Tiffany
 
 Like Orlando
 Not everyones a retired person or a
college student Somebodys got to actually clean
that place up

 I really do I have plans

 Deep plans
 Amigo
 Im lost
 I like marmalade
 That was a long walk
 Thats in an emergency
 Why are there two of you here
 Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and then
youre two people on a ship and youre involved in
things and I mean its a good emergency plan
but can you only go once You cant go twice
 A few of us were eating apricots at the
time
 Youre very sneaky
 I can give you guys enhanced ability
too for the remains of the evening You can pick
something and both of you if you want to be
better at something for a little while
 I wouldnt know how to help with that
 It also seems like a lot of commitment
but okay I can keep an eye on that
 Have we seen anything around like
another tavern or something maybe a little I hate
to say more upscale but cleaner
 Something with less piles of shit behind
it
 Yes
 Three rooms
 I dont know actually Im following it
actually for the first time this entire
 Youll be a good go between If we hear
something bad we can get an owl to ship if you
hear something then
 No
 No I dont think we
 We dont need to actually know whats
going on in there Why does anybody need to know that
 Well I think the thing to do here I
mean it just makes sense is that if you leave
the room for any reason we send Frumpkin to the
ship They see Frumpkin they know its time to
 Thats the signal
 Im staying downstairs to wait for you
to either come down or for her to leave Im going
to sit and probably try and find something
nonalcoholic to drink so I dont have to be an idiot
 Upstairs
 Let me see yeah
 I think Yasha is probably either with
you Shes either with you or with us I imagine
 Hows a dex bonus go for you Hows an
advantage on dex or do you already have
 Less that could possibly go wrong so
before they go in Im going to cast Enhance
Ability on these two At a level three so I get
two people
 Thats fair All right
 It also will give you zero damage for a
foot fall if I give you a dex bonus But
 You have Feather Fall So you want
charisma
 Thats not helpful Charisma Unless you
make a decision in the next  seconds
 Cool And youre getting wisdom You
have advantage on wisdom you have advantage on
charisma Then right before you go in Im going
to give you guys both a resistance bump before we
push them through the door Just in case you need
it
 For one minute they can add a d to a
saving throw
 Is it just a general d bonus
 A cantrip You touch one willing
creature once before the spell ends The target
can roll a d and add the number to its roll
 Oh youre right absolutely never mind
then Not a big deal Thank you Im getting used
to this concentration
 Does Notts cloak unattune if they take
it off
 You still have
 Were bad at everything
 Oh no
 Oh no
 I think Im going to join in really
quickly Is everything all right You guys need
anything Ive been sober all evening so Im happy
to help
 Who got stabbed
 Waldok got stabbed But Waldoks so
nice
 Who would stab Waldock Thats
terrible
 Where did you hear this from Where did
this come down from
 Oh he seems okay I guess
 Come here were going to patch you
right up Cmon Ill take care of this
 Everybody come on lets do this Yeah
how bad is it
 Okay Im going to give him a level two
Cure Wounds to get him going Thatd ought to heal
him right
 All right lets do a level two Lets
see what that looks like Thats d Dont know
why Im being so fuddyduddy about this Do I get
a specialty no its only when Im healing
myself Okay 
 Okay youre going to want to sit down
Take it easy for a while I wouldnt get up for
like a good half hour Be very gentle on yourself
Why dont we get this man a drink
 Why dont you get that man a drink
 Someone was eating gems in bed
 Thats loud Okay All right
 Sure
 Just a purple tiefling
 You have advantage
 Ive never seen your eyes glaze over
like that Matt
 Hows that charisma bonus working out
for you
 Im wet and upset Why did you do
that
 Hes walking Shes swimming
 Unless youd have taken that dex bonus
and then nothing would have happened at all
 But you didnt
 Youre both wet
 Talking to the guy Were bonding man
These guys are pretty okay once you get to know them
 Weird night
 Well everythings not quiet on this
end One of our kids apparently got stabbed by
Well one of the crew stabbed the other crew I
cant imagine why that happened Theres been no
word but I assume its just probably pandemonium
all over
 Everyones pretty happy though You
should come down and have a drink with everybody
 I hope someone has followed this right
back to the inn so thats good
 Ill tell you what Obviously whatever
went down were going to just go make sure
everythings copacetic back at the boat Well be
back in just a couple minutes Just going to make
sure everything
 Yeah Well let you know Ill walk
brazenly down to the ship with you
 Well go check it out anyway
 Im going down
 Do I see a commotion from here
 Nothing crazy going on on our ship I
dont see some figures or anything
 Really
 I would never Well thats fine because
even with a   with disadvantage

 I love this This is the best character
ever
 I might see if theres a torchbearer
walking around really quickly
 Excuse me sir
 We had a little trouble on our ship
earlier I was curious if everything was all
right I heard a little commotion
 Well if I wanted to find out what went
down do you know who I would talk to
 Ill be right back
 Im going to go find a guard and ask
them whats up
 I just want to find out what was up from
somebody
 Really Does he need healing I can do
that or otherwise
 Yeah Ill take care of it real quick
 Oh in that case Healing Word level
three
 Make a medicine check
 Yeah thatll do thats a 
 I love this character so much
 Its all right
 There you go
 Lets give him a Cure Wounds level three
just to
 Or what does he look like a level two
or a level three to you
 A level two should be sufficient All
right Lets just take care of this Can you tell
me what happened son
 
 While you were up the crows nest what
happened
 It looks fine up there
 What did you what was the last 
hours for you What did you
 I mean like I dont oh no
  I may have left some of the
fruit that we picked up in our last stop in the
kitchen I dont know what youve been eating for
the last thats maybe my fault I really hope it
isnt but
 Seven
 Im going to be worried Im going to
check to make sure Ive got all this just in
case because that sounds awfully familiar Do you
need a drink
 Come on Were going to bring you back
its okay
 Poor guy Come on
 Im bringing back Im going to just
sort of yeah Bring him back and then tell everybody
 Im definitely going to tell everyone my
fruit theory because Im down a fruit
 Im tired
 Hes very stern for Charlie Adler
 Dont you have a spell you can cast that
solves this problem
 If you just bring everything out really
quickly Ill cast Detect Magic on there
 Ill cast Detect Magic in the meantime
 Nah hes fine
 Oh wow
 Were literally looking at them right
now and I Detected Magic before we opened the boxes
 That ones got a little bit of tingle to
it Id be worried about that one Why dont you
take a look at that really quickly
 That books not worth its circle of
salt
 Perception check Insight check
 Im pretty low so what do you got
 
 What was the necklace while were
here
 Well Really whats the necklace before
we go any further to make sure its not a
comefindmyshit
 Is there any part in the book that is
actually a cipher for its own Okay
 It would be amazing if you pulled this
off
 But not this one
 Take a second to identify the necklace
so we dont get
 Yeah
 Heres the thing
 are we going to remove
the mention of you from the book
 Theres no way of inferring within the
book
 But it doesnt connect the newcomers to
the new chosen
 One could not infer that the new chosen
was part of the newcomers from the way she wrote
it or no Is it separated thoughts
 All right Worstcase scenario is we
could mend a page and it will remove the ink if we
want to delete anything
 Its very helpful That might be
either
 In the best case scenario I would say
if we could hide this is someone elses room
underneath their bed
 I would love for these to be in somebody
elses room
 Its still going to be findable to
anybody whos looking for it though I would
really recommend putting it I dont know
somewhere where we dont mind it being very
specifically found especially if were trying
to
 Well I hate to put it that way but uh
I dont know This seems
 That doesnt matter Its still in her
room
 We have to make sure that you survive
long enough to get it there I mean I wish youd
just grabbed the book That would make life more
easy
 Yeah we do
 We still need to prove the book
 Thats too much I feel like we can take
the book to him I think if we say that we knew
about the plot we suspected and were looking for
proof
 We have a copy of the contents of the
book
 I think hed kill both of them I think
sending it with Just sending it to him and just
giving it to him
 I would almost say if we could give him
the whole kit and kaboodle everything that was
stolen top to bottom with a note saying this is
the full
 I say translate the one page give the
cipher so that they can figure it out on their
own Lets give the whole thing to him just all
the jewels all the box the whole thing top to bottom
 Well be fine
 Then we can take our boat
 Lets let them make any insinuations
they want The crew will fall the way they will
Again I think giving too much is too much The
guys itching for a reason to get rid of her
Lets give him what he wants No conditions no
terms Nothing
 In the safe maybe
 Were not going to translate the whole
book just one page
 Well how is she going to get the book
back
 Does that make sense
 Hes making the cipher
 Lets rip a few pages out
 No Im going to my room
 Itll wake us up though
 Oh new spells
 I thought Okay were Okay new
plan Sure
 Its in the safe
 Thats not true
 Everything comes out
 Whats going on man Hey Good
morning
 Ill go get dressed
 Ill grab my stuff
 How long does that take
 The whole thing
 Pop out of the room that
 Oof
 Yeah it was no problem
 Well it looked That leg was pretty
rough Hmm
 I can No I can find creatures I
cant find objects
 It can only go better
 We have video man I didnt do it
 Oh sweet Jesus
 Someones getting Velcro in their
stocking
 
 
 Wow this is a look
 I know its hard to think right now
 Okay I just saw that we are running
apparently
 Well okay Lets see Im going to
follow Yasha because thats apparently the way
how much distance can I cover How close to her
can I get
 Is there an easier way off or is that
the easiest way off the boat
 Oh yeah Whichever way gets me closer to
her quickly
 Im learning
 Okay Ill take that other  for now
then
 Yeah Im going to hold there for now
 I was going to say theyre going to hit
the guard
  for me
 My heart is fucking racing right now I
am not okay
 Did that guard take damage
 Okay
 My passive perception is 
 Is he within  feet of me Wait no I
can cast this on myself cant I
 Can I cast Let me take a look really
quick if I can do this Sentinel Can I cast
Sentinel on myself
 As a reaction when you or a creature
you can see within  feet
 Oh yeah
 So none of that
  Cool
 I am looking irritated at the guards at
this
 Caleb is not within  feet of me
either is he
 Just checking
 Im not even going to dignify that
 Travis Yes
 He aint going to be hitting me
 Oh man wow I am really stuck on that
arent I Thats irritating
 Thats difficult terrain though so if
I burn my action Im only going to get  feet
 Hmm Lets get weird Okay
 Im going to vanish Thats the first
thing Im going to do
 Theres a joke there that I cannot think
of what it is because Im too freaked out I can
cast while Im invisible correct
 Well the invisibility only lasts one
round
 Not a big deal
 As long as its not a damage spell I
can just
 Oh okay Yeah Ill just ignore that
then Ill stay invisible and Im going to try and
take my  feet
 Yeah my 
 Can I get one further away just to
 Yeah just to get a little cover Thank
you
 I have never been so proud
 Attack of opportunity
 Fuck man
 Being taken to the Plank King aint
bad
 Do they even know who the Plank King
is
 Acrobatics or athletics Those are both
terrible okay
 Im a big thing A  is what I rolled
I rolled a  plus one so Im going to do an
acrobatics run
 I am to be fair invisible Its hard
to grab
 What the fuck is happening
 You are tanking This is a tank This is
a good tank
 Wow Really Now Really
 So thats fine
 This is six rounds of Well thats
okay
 Im mad as hell And Im not going to
take it anymore
 I Immediately turn visible
 Hey
 Im going to Yeah Im just going to
help my friend there Im not going anywhere
itll be fine Im going to cast Bless on Nott and
Yasha and can I Bless myself or can I not Bless myself
 I can Bless myself So Im going to cast
Bless on the three of us
 Thats a d to your saving throws and to
your attacks
 All your saving throws and your attacks
you add a d
 No its a concentration spell so A
little something something
 Does it look like hes going to make an
attack Because Im going to start scooting towards
 How far away is Caleb currently
 Im going to point and start walking
that way just going Is he going to make a swing
 Okay I cant use a bonus action to
convince him to let me walk by can I
 Oh yeah Would I know that or would I
not know that
 Okay thats fair All right Its
looking like hes going to hold
 Im going to turn to the other side of
him while not being very aggressive and Im going to
 I know but hes
 He needs a little bit of healing
 While were having that conversation
Im going to flip around to the other side of him
so Im a little further away from Yasha The other
way
 Yeah Keep going There Not quite in
contact with the other
 Im not going to quite bump into them
you know
 Is there shit I can do with my bonus or
is there nothing I can do with my bonus Probably
not That might be everything I can do Yeah Im
going to cast a quick Healing Word on Yasha who
could probably use a quick Healing Word
 So take a little
 Ooh thats nice Take an extra nine
points of healing
 They have an official sash
 Is he within  feet of me No not 
feet Goddamn it
 What happens to her concentration
spell
 Do the guards now know that they were
being manipulated
 Still have to make a dex save from it
though
 Whats she got in there
 Oh my god its too pretty
 Youll see me at a game store I dont
know which one but Ill be there
 DD D
 I was having so much Treasure Island
flashes Thats one of my favorite books and its
like all of this is so good All of its so good
 Whitestone saw the fire
 If I can take ten minutes of this time
sitting manacled to cast Prayer if enough of us
are within  feet of each other right now
 Its all vocal
 Its only verbal And I tell them
 Im going to be healing everybody Its
a thing that I
 
 All right thats fine
 This is what you get for Counterspell
 Its just a cheek caress then gone Not
even a kiss goodnight
 This is basically a short rest Is this
what this is
 I think theres already some work that
can be checked if that speeds it up I mean that
should be
 Oh yeah
 Well be fine
 Wow fuck you
 Fucking belly flop into the water
 Come on Jester lets
 Thats right
 Yeah weve got a way
 Im going to try and calm the crew a
little bit
 Ill point out that were this is all
good We got away from the pirates everythings all right
 Thats 
 We dont have to pigeon this I mean we
know what you can do so maybe paint the fix for it
 Were going to spend a day moving
slowly but I think were going to slowly figure
out how between all of us we can repair this
and Im sure we can figure out where to get some cloth
 Yeah its a lot different kind of
game
 Or an island where we
 We can use Divination
 If its been  hours once I have a
long rest I can take my morning meditation and
ask the Wildmother if theres a place of calm for
our boat
 I can do a lot of stuff man
 I was going to do that Yeah
 Yeah in the early morning Im going to
go to the crows nest and have a tenminute
meditation and ask the Wildmother which direction
we should be heading to find some safe harbor to
heal ourselves and heal our boat
 Yes it is a thlevel spell its
Divination
 Im using it It takes ten minutes and
you can be as obtuse as you like You can be a
bird that flies in a direction an insect or
whatever
 I was seeing if there was anything else
I can do Im setting day two spells so well
have food and water
 Sea smells different today Might just
be the charred boat and Oh no Bisaft
 Bisaft Were to head towards Bisaft
 Sure as anything
 Orly
 Know the Isle of Bisaft
 That seem to be the direction were
heading right now
 I think that might be the place we ought
to go
 Thank you
 How about that statue above the door
 I was about to say I might be able to
do that too
 Nope never mind oh yeah Ive got
it too
 Its like in Mary Poppins everyone
holds the china
 And  oclock
 What do you I dont entirely
understand what youre
 You want to see if I get oh for the
ship I dont know Thats a
 Ive got Locate Creature Yeah weve
both got Locate Object so we can both help with that
 Im looking for a boat Im looking for
a ship Im looking for a shipwreck not an
object We could do object too
 So we can take turns
 Yeah so the food aint good but its
edible and the waters fine
 We can cast it at level three also
which is another
 I like that were here now
 Im going to be stocking us up on food
too so that theres more than enough food and
water for the whole group
 
 Oh Im doing save Im so sorry Fuck
I was doing the wrong
 I said   and then 
 
 Three
  on the first roll
  on the second roll
   Yeah lets blow another What
else are we going to do for the day
 
 I had a moment
 Yeah Its gone now Would I know
direction even
 But were moving I know
 Lets do one more
 Ill also join in for one more for that
as well Its my last spell slot
 Oh Okay Im still holding the boat
Thats fine
 I do
 Actually this is a check not a save
so it wouldnt
 
 
 That was my third was 
 Thats a very good idea
 Oh this means well probably have to go
in the water
 Im also going to put Bless on the
octopus before it
 Its one minute
 Lets have them Lets tell the crew
whats up Early in the morning at first light
 Im always making breakfast Im not
going to even use the weird plants
 Ive been putting that weird fruit in
everyones food for a week now by the way Just
so were clear
 Just kidding but wouldnt that be
great
 Everyones just be like Wow
 I do
 On my staff
 Scarred for life
 It never ends well Theres no right
answer to that question
 Water weasel
 We have bugs and cheese
 We always got bugs and cheese man
 Theres a couple of options here
 Well we want to be able to carry them
so if we have some small bags maybe
 We can just put them in a bag that we
can hold
 I dim the light
 My weapon glows but I did snuff it down
I was waiting until we knew that we were okay I
move my light over to him
 Hey Technically they can understand
me
 At disadvantage
 Oh 
 Just because were banished doesnt mean
were never going back
 Oh Im so sorry Like a cop said
youre trespassing and now were just going to
never trespass again
 We were freaking out all for two weeks
straight
 That was entirely worth the amount of
data it took up on my phone
 Of course
 Yeah
 Thats actually a good idea Im also
going to
 Perception checks
 Also Im going to cast Eyes of the
Grave Im going to do this a couple times
 Eyes of the Grave Thats perception of

 Oh with disadvantage
 Oh okay I thought we had put them back
up
 
 With Eyes of the Grave
 Yeah the sheet of paper you turned in
nine months ago
 Im perfectly happy to head towards
this
 Quick point of order whos got the
node We should probably decide now
 Who was the last to node Are you
noded
 You node
 I assume we would have done it I was
just playing flashback but I dont know
 That was more of a point of order
 Do you need a light
 All right
 Well this is a mess
 I think doing a onceover might not be a
bad idea
 Maybe bring the little octopi with you
 Oh Okay thats a
 Thats okay
 I think we should probably all stick
together one way or the other
 Im going to let the flora and fauna in
here know that were looking for some stuff One
of our people used to live here Well be gone
and everythings going to be fine
 How big a creature does it look like was
taking a
 
 Maybe its time to
 Just a little walk around just to get a
sense of the place
 Hm No
 Thank you Petco
 Yeah I dont know if I was quite
outside yet I think Beau and I maybe switch
places if thats okay
 Crickets
 Four
 I mean it means your advantage cancels
that out though so
 Good to know
 It went great
 What does Slow give them
 Am I going to double this up How are
you feeling
 Pretty good Im going to use a bonus
action I can do two first level spells in a
round right If ones bonus action one is an
action thats fine
 Just one or the other
 Cantrip there we go Thank you Im
going to scoot past you with half of my action if
thats okay and take a look outside to see whats
up How far away
 I have five feet no matter what Okay
Goddamn Theres no getting back in anyway so
fuck it Yeah theres no sense trying to get back
inside Im just going to be vulnerable How far
away is that one Is that more than  feet away
 Theres no way I can get close enough to
get within  feet right now is there
 You know what Its not like distance is
a problem here Ill go in an angle and declump
yeah right there
 I think all three of those are within 
feet then at this point I think thats pretty
fair Im casting Bane on all three of them

 Thats a charisma save against 
 They all take a negative d from an
attack or saving throws All three of them
 Its not a bad stlevel spell
 Thats everything I can do
 Wait take negative d to that too
 Wait what
 Okay Ah well But its still got
Bane
 You got Baned
 Banes pretty cool
 Hey Eh
 You may not be able to get to him
 With a negative d
 Minus four Or minus a d
 Dont you fuck around with me
 Minus well it doesnt matter because
it can still only bring it down to  right
 What
 No Im saying that with the d it
wouldnt bring that attack down at all would it
enough to be managed
 Well Im canceling the critical
anyway
 Nope
 Yeah
 We dont want them reporting back to
people
 
  months from now
 Do you have the
rusty key
 How many people got hurt in that fight
by the way Three of us I think took damage
 While were walking its going to be
about a tenminute walk Is it insane to
 Yeah as were walking Im going to
start Prayer of Healing I guess I know it takes
about ten minutes but its a onespell healall
 If thats okay Everybody gets oh 
points back
 I was waiting for it
 I mean I dont think thats
 Regardless Im blind regardless
 I cant see so Ill stick with
somebody
 Ill stick with Yasha
 Yasha and Clay and everyone else is
singling or
 I think the notion is that youre not
supposed to look directly in it some sort of
thing maybe
 Dont look at whatever the eye or light
or thing I dont know
 Thunk
 Yeah I dont think thats a
 No
 I think theyre going to be nervous that
Fjord doesnt speak the language and is moving at
half plus he swims funny
 Not for a fish person though
 I dont have
 There you go
 I dont think we should go in this way
either
 I think thats a very reasonable plan
 One question This is definitely coral
that we are sitting on top of right
 It is a protruding large slab of stone
and not a bigass mouth or anything like that right
 Im looking at it  
 Its been a day
  Im putting
tinfoil on my windows now Im fucking done
 Yes DM I think we send Jester
 I think maybe we just dont take the
coins maybe
 The minute I hear things start Im
going to cast some light on the walls so I can see shit
 Were in the room
 I may be blind other than what I can
see but if I hit Detect Magic somethings going
to light up in my
 All right Im just saying if there was
something I feel like I would know that
 Im going to cast Detect Magic Whyd I
put a question mark at the end of that
 Im going to cast Detect Magic really
quickly
 The magical auras coming from the mouth
of the cave
 Oh Its where the lights being
projected from I imagine But nothing in the room
 I would also be able to sense something
magic through it thats buried up to three feet down
 Okay Im not getting any other pings in
here
 Just that weird thing up front nothing
else
 Im going to ask the kelp
 Hey guys
this feels a little ominous Youd let me know if
there was something untoward happening around
here right Right
 Thank you that is fair
 Im proud of you for that Hopefully
thatll be the first good roll youve made tonight
 To be fair they dont really talk back
but sometimes they can acknowledge these things
Besides its polite
 I literally cant see anything right
now
 Things tend to live
 I would ask permission before putting a
light in the kelp to see if theres anything in there
 When was the yeah all right
 Did it trip my Detect Magic sense at
all
 Im going to do another detect undead
really quickly
 All right Eyes of The Grave As an
action you know the location of any undead within
 feet of you that isnt behind total cover and
isnt protected from divination magic until the
end of your next turn
 Six seconds
 We have undead
 I dont know Im literally blind I
want to light this
 Just to start Im going to throw some
light into the center of the kelp
 I think this thing is carnivorous
 Yep
 I think we should leave
 Yeah lights off
 Ive still got a few minutes of Detect
Magic so if anything
 Im going to cast Light really quickly
too
 Do I even have to bother or do I know
what that is
 Its something different
 Oh then Im going to do the Eyes of the
Grave one more time the minute I see it Theres
something else down here too
 Youre going to take it
 Yasha can
 Yeah lets have Yasha
 Did you take your  earlier also
 From Prayer of Healing
 That was for everybody
 Everyone was
 Did a group thing
 Yeah Theres something up ahead
 They know were here now
 Yeah
 Just for fun Im going to tap
Resistance on you Well Im just going to give
you if anything happens in the next minute you
can add a d to any saving throw
 Im going to take a perception check
then
 Thats fair
 Okay Im going to Turn Undead really
quickly and then Im going to go over and deal
with you
 The DC on Turn Undead is let me hit
my
 Thats a wisdom saving throw Its right
here so its why is it not saying these things
 Mines weird Wisdom saving throw Oh
so is that my
 Oh 
 Fuck off ghost
 Not cool man Not cool
 Yeah
 He was creepy man Come on
 Yeah
 Not that I know of I hope I mean
would you know
 Is it worth cutting through some of this
stuff
 I can join you for that
 Lets find what were looking for and
get out of here
 Thank you Its been a long day
 Damage
 Thats seven radiant damage
 Yeah well take it 
 Does my Detect Magic which I think is
just barely still up I dont feel like this has
been a tenminute venture since that
 Its not much longer I know
 No Im just coming in and looking
around
 I think its maybe time for another
detect object Ill take this one Im going to
cast Locate Object
 On the stone
 Its by the chair
 Shes right above the throne
  Plus one so thats 
 Oh fuck
 Fuck This is so much worse than I was
imagining
 An encounter
 
 I cant see them anymore
 I was just going to cast Bless Entirely
up to you
 Im going to cast Bless on myself
 Bless is concentration So Im casting
Bless on myself on Caleb and on Fjord
 Also Im going to back up into the wall
so I can keep an eye down that
 Well no See that little thing that
little node behind me
 Yeah so I cant be attacked from
behind but also I can keep an eye on
 As long as theres no seaweed there
 Oh then Im not going against the wall
Im sorry
 Then Im going to take a step or two
down to scatter us a little bit more
 Yeah I know its a little weird
 Thank you Yeah anyway I know
 Fuck
 If you have the d you can use the d
 No just to Fjord Wisdom saving throw
Ha
  The fuck is this shit Who the fuck
are you people
 I got this Ive got him
 I still have my light
 With extra ds on both
 From being attacked physically
 Did she get tapped in the head by the
way Since we are running her
 Fuck
 Yep
 No its a d
 You want to go
 No yeah no my opinions are weird
 Motherfucking dexterity save Thats
some bullshit
 Im going to also do this Im going to
do a Sacred Flame
 That does not because its a 
 And thats nine points of radiant
damage
 I dont like the look of this thing Im
going to turn invisible and Im going to back up a
little into the
 I mean down the steps a bit
 Towards me Oh I got a thing still
 Yeah so Im far enough away from
anything that I might need to fuck with
 She starts  feet within
 Be happy in your work
 Oh yeah oh god
 Nope
 No attack of opportunity
 I feel you
 Fuck motherfucker
 Or hold action
 Yeah
 Going to have to wait until it passes
 Im not particularly interesting Im
just going to
 I reappear Im going to move a little
further into the center of the room and Im going
to
 No a little Ive got a pen for this
Oh my god its dead now To be fair weve been
using it for years Just at the foot of the
stairs
 Yeah like there Well make a nice long
line so itll be a little touchyfeely thing to
get from one side to the other Im going to hold
my attack until I see her which is going to be a
Sacred Flame
 As a bonus Im going to do Healing Word
on you are probably pretty down so I will throw
you a tiny bit its not a lot but its nine
points
 That was me
 And save against dex 
 Motherfucker
 Yeah all I need
 Youve got a d on saves also Dex
save
 Six
 All right
 Speed is halved
 Technically I think you have line of
sight from what Im looking at right now
 Damn it
 You still know where she is because of
Hex though right
 Whos up
 Help
 Yay Thank you
 Im just going to do the Fjord you
should probably get what were looking for and get
after her Im going to hightail it towards where
she was heading
 Including burning an action
 Yeah
 Still have a reaction
 I can take a little more damage before
Im awful
 No
 Yeah you cant do that no
 Oh remember your extra d I forgot
them
 
 Id rather not have this
 I dont feel okay with you being alone
 Im going to do the same
 Checks no Saves and attacks
 I am basically holding ready to shoot a
bolt at anything that moves and I was actually
hanging a little bit far down just in case one of
them drops I can heal and somewhere where Im
not going to get attacked by kelp and Im keeping
very aware
 I would have made my way a little bit
further
 Puncher of ghosts
 I can see this happen right
 Sacred Flame
 Thats ten points of radiant damage
 Im staying right at them and Im
looking for any movement while all this is happening
 
  This is such a bad idea
 I am just waiting for something to
move
 I dont like this place
 Are we out of the cavern now
 Were going to back out slowly get out
of this cavern Does everyone want to meet me
right once we can see the surface of the water
 Are we there We done
  Water Walk
 We are going to jet to the surface of
the water Its  feet around
 It wouldnt be a pressure thing because
we have water in us anyway
 Lets walk to the ship
 Thats why I made sure to pack some
stuff just in case Lets get out of here That
place gives me the creeps
 To keep pouring blood on well
 Well be moving at twice speed since
its normal speed and not our halved speed
 You ever see those videos with the
 walking on the pudding Like that
 Or two three
 Biscotti Islands
 Literally the first thing they teach
you
 Ah I heard your name Whatever theyre
saying I heard your name
 What language were you speaking
 Goddamn it I dont know that one
 Try not to do it well
 Thats an improvement
 Thats impressive
 Lets not get ahead of ourselves
 Im going stay and keep an eye out on
deck
 Thats how you get a Pinhead man
Nope

 Ive got nothing man I dont even
know
 How much chocolate have you been eating
And for how long Whoa Oh wow
 How deep are these waters Im trying to
figure out how much of this is obviously a lot
of this is bullshit
 All right
 
 Yeah even just general vibe
 All right everythings been
 A little omission maybe
 All right
 I honestly think we need to feed you
something that isnt chocolate
 Thats a squirrel I know that one
 Squirrels are great
 I was just about to go get something
with something thats not chocolate in it Thats
probably for the best Ill be back Oh boy
 Im coming up with a veggie plate by
the way the sort of things youre embarrassed
your parents bring up and putting it down
 Do you have any future plans here Is
there something that youre moving towards Do you
have a place that youre heading a goal
anything
 Thats great
my most winningest smile
 Youre doing great then But theres a
direction a cardinal direction that youre making
these friends in or do you
 Oh would you look at that
 You mind if I take a look at that really
quick
 You can roll it Its all right
 Im going to try to move some stuff and
see what happens
 Oh man Awesome Oh no damn it was
almost a natural one Im so sad Thats a six
 Huh Thats really cool though I
imagine doing that all day Thatd be great Yeah
I can imagine doing that all day
 Wow Rolls really well too Im sorry
I dont actually even remember why I asked for it
thing
 Oh thats fancy
 There was a twirl and it went back
 Im going to Detect Magic to get a
 Yeah
 Okay No ones got anything sitting on
her
 Okay Same vibe
 Those were all over it then
 This is apparently a Mary Poppins
musical act
 Calligraphys very impressive
 Caleb just a second Just thought you
should know theres a couple interesting magical
auras on our new friend I thought it would be
impolite to point it out or to dispel anything I
try and respect peoples personal intentions but
if you feel the urge to do a little Identify at
some point that may not be a bad idea I dont
know Just to make sure that everything thats
there is meant to be there
 Im not getting a bad vibe off of this
one just a lot of sugar Being held up for a
while in a dark confined space can make people a
little loopy
 No I also agree I think it draws an
unfortunate amount of attention

 Thats fair Thats a very fair point
 I dont know if shes necessarily going
to listen to you Shes a little
 Thats very true You do have an air of
authority You do Right now Im feeling really
awkward about this whole conversation purely from
your face Your face has done nothing and now Im just
 That weirdly makes me feel better Ill
disengage straight up then
 Thats fine Im going to go over and
cook something
 Ill be finishing up some stuff in the
kitchen Im going to run by Caleb one more time
to have a chat about what he saw Just mention
weve got two magical spheres on board The ones
like a clock thing
 Technically three
 I was thinking its like a clock Maybe
that means time I dont know if times passing
or something
 Or at least let you take a look at it
for a while or something Maybe I dont know It
gives me a chill Not sure
 This is dark Even for me this is
dark
 Im finally walking in because everybody
has vanished off the ship and no one is eating anything
 What are we
 Okay I like grabbing feet Here we
are
 Oh yep Im on it
 Wow Thats cool Do that again
 The fourth wall lies
 Im excited
  Dont touch it Mum
its evil
 The two corpses what can we ascertain
about them Are they wearing clothing
 Nudists get trapped in here all the
time
 I want to be by the corpses I rolled a

here
 That was not a sick beat
 Do they look like violently ended or do
they look like people who fell asleep and never
got up
 Yeah 
 They definitely got a look like they saw
something wicked awful
 Lets take a minute before we
 Just going to do a quick Cure Wounds
 Just one Oh thats good Take 
points of healing
 Lets take a second here
 I think we should
 I think we should talk to the locals
before we do anything else
 Oh these fellows
 Oh I cant pick Somebody else pick I
dont know
 Yeah I dont know
 Yeah okay Thats level three right
Yep there we are
 Speak With Dead
 Im so sorry friend You have one more
task to perform before we can let you rest What
killed you
 The wailing creature What color was the
curtain the wailing creature hid behind
 Good to know How did you end up here
 Whats the name of that
 What does the name Halas mean to you
 Well thats no help
 Do you know how to get out of here
 Im going to give him a little pop and
seed him for later
 Mmhmm
 Thank you Well that was a little
helpful
 Maybe theyre all bad
 So we already know what two of these
are
 I feel like I was told as a child not to
put things in my ears but I guess Im doing this
 I wonder whats behind green
 Sound a beam theres a screech
theres a gas
 I dont know what goes next
 Feels a bit extreme
 That says that the door is trapped not
necessarily that the door is unopenable
 I mean theres a lot going on right
now
 Im going to doublecheck these bodies
for things before we go If anyone wants to help
me with an investigation check
 Sure
 Seems that they were robbed before they
came in here Its weird
 Oh thats even crazier
robbed postmortem or premortem I dont know
How do you tell that
 I mean we did just cause a giant
lightning thing I feel like our presence has been announced
 Im going to light up my staff at any
rate
 Although we should probably have someone
check ahead just for traps
to do it
 Nope
to wait She starts to chase the cat She wants to
go see the cat and pet the cat
 Yeah but well know its there just in
case
 Oh well then never mind
 I was making light
 I mean
 Can you see anything Beau
 Im going to roll Eyes of the Grave
too just to see if anything
 Im rolling Eyes of the Grave Just for
the hell of it
 Ill be after Beau
 Im paying attention
  Tiptoe through the tulips
 Or we are
 Im going to try and use Thaumaturgy
through the door to see if I can affect the flame
before we enter
 Well thats weird
 Were not in there yet
 No I was just curious if the magic
would follow through apparently not or whatever
is in there is not real I dont know
 
 So many toys today
 Hey oh

 I love a good ladder
 Im going to try the candelabra again
see if I can get those flames a little brighter
 Ill reel them back in All right
thats good to know
 Im going to maybe throw some
illumination up so we can see the window a bit better
 Yeah I was going to say I was actually
thinking about getting up I would like that that
weird corner ladder
 Yeah
 I like a good loft position Since I was
a kid my favorite thing
 Can we see his feet
 I would check for things but
 Okay lets all just be very careful
before we do anything
 For Petes Sacred Flame
 Three
 Theres a long sigh at the beginning of
the round
 This is a death trap This is a fucking
death trap
 Im going to hit it with Sacred Flame
 Going to hit this guy with a Sacred
Flame
 Yep dexterity saving throw
 Nah I didnt think it would be Thats
not bad thats  points of damage
 Spit it out Come on
 Yeah
 Lets all maybe be a little more careful
about the
 Is there anything I see on the top of
these cabinets Theres all this space above and
I want to see if theres anything
 All right Come on Ill take that
Thats a 
 Hey oh god everybodys Twiggy can
you grab that stack of books over there and throw
them at Caleb Or take a look at that
covered in disgustingness so I start wiping it
off and shaking like a dog It flies everywhere
 Lets take a look at these
 Lets look at this lock see if it seems
trapped or something or I dont know
 Here wipe it on this Thats okay
 Hey Caleb

 Yeah
 If you stick around Im going to be
helping every Im doing a thing
 Okay  points to everybody whos
hanging around for a few minutes
 Its been a long day
 Sometimes mysterious spheres just happen
to you if Im learning anything
 I mean maybe sure
 Lets pack some food and some tea and
stuff before you go youre going to need some
 Yeah Im going to go get some food
 Oh thats weird
 Yeah
 Im probably going to come out about
halfway through your shift with a pot and two
cups Another day
 Weirdly I think Im great
 Yeah I know
 No
 Well in the morning were going to
comfort everybody Were going to take care of
them were going to feed them Its going to be
our job to feel good for them and bring them back
around They did good work they just dont
believe it
 Somethings happening I dont know
what but somethings happening And you did good
 Thank you Do better next time to keep
everybody safe
 You had some weirdass spells up right
You had some weirdass shit that I didnt know
about I saw them but I never really poked You
dont have to tell me what it was did you have
some weird shit that if I had prodded it would
have been a thing
 All right okay lets just do that
then
stuff with my normal stuff
 I could use some solid land Thatd be
nice
 Well at the very least maybe you should
have Nott try and open some of those funny locks
on the books before we go so that you have an
easier time getting into them
 I dont think we opened the individual
locks on the books I think you just grabbed
locked books
 Oh And I grab this one too There was
one more that you didnt get to see
 I dont know what it is I just picked
it up Seemed like the thing to do
 Yeah anytime
 Angry furniture
 A lot happened
 There was a doll too if I recall
There was a doll there were some marbles dust a
lot of books
 Ooh did you get the marbles and the
ink Thats nice
 Honestly we were trying to figure out
what had happened
 My mother was a big believer in the
buddy system Growing up in the woods buddy
system Always should have a buddy
 We know
 Oh yeah okay Oh I see this yeah
 I was in a wall
 Yeah I think that everybody here thinks
that this is their fault Raise your hand if you
think what happened yesterday was your fault
 What do I roll
 
 I usually find that if everybody thinks
that theyre the ones that did something wrong
its because nobody did everything wrong You just
had a string of luck I think everybody did really good
 I think that we all got out of there I
think that we all tried our best and were going
to do better next time Im feeling very
positive
 You survived a dragon
 You took a risk Risks are okay Got to
be careful what risks you take but without risks
were never going to get what we want
 Well I think we want breakfast
 Then we can have a talk about that
 Excellent I dont actually even know
how to get off this boat We havent done it
properly in so long
 Roll for first mate
 Were going to need to wash some dishes
arent we
 Im walking towards where I think
breakfast is
 Natural  I was really looking forward
to having no idea but apparently
 Hold on I got Yelp I cast Yelp
 Oh thats better I was like
 Mm
okay
 I can pick around the boar that
shouldnt be a problem
 I dont eat boar
 I dont eat meat
 Have you not noticed
 Oh Yeah no I mean weve barely
cooked with any of it in the last month
 Its mostly seitan Theres a few
different things I use You can really get an
effect its
 Making me call my vegan cooking not
legit My god Im mad right now
 Theres a lot of paprika Pasta burgers
A lot of beets Im excited for this
 Pocket boar
 Im going to try some mead
 Not meat But I am going to try some
mead
 It smells really sweet Whats the
sweetest thing youve got right now
 Sure I think that sounds like a great
idea
 This is going to go so well
 Do you have anything thats more less
meat
 Ill throw a little in on this
 That seems very fair
 Back out back out
 Insects supplies
 No sense reading twothirds of a book
Lets finish this up see what it has to say
 I think some bees would suit you
 You can talk to them
 Ive talked to many bees in my time
 Yeah
 I mean you just
 Hey bees Howre you
doing
 Yeah
 Thank you for looking everywhere in that
room Thats really nice
 Yeah it was crazy in there
 I mean that actually would have covered
everybody the more you think about it
 Wait was alive or not a joke I
always get confused when people use the word not
in a sentence Was that supposed to be a
 Though every time we did a little thing
a little of that loot comes out
 Caleb is actually not over here
 Everyone was a little thrown by what
happened
 Its worth a lot and probably well be
a little more careful about poking things separately
 No its the buddy system No blame
going around
 Were doing the bee tour
 Im going to try and find a blacksmith
 There may not be much time for such
things but I was
 Keisha
 Possibly not Seems like you have your
hands full right now I was hoping to at the very
least get a professional opinion about
something
 Thats what they tell me
 Well Ive recently taken to travelling
which very new experience for someone of my
disposition and I came across something
interesting and I was curious if you had an
opinion on what this is and how one might fix it
I pull out a broken sword
 I was really hoping to be doing
something with this at some point and giving it
as a gift to a friend who could use a pickmeup
 Sadly I dont It may not exist
 Oh thats all right Theyre definitely
trying hard to get us to leave a little sooner
than wed necessarily like to
 Has everything been all right by the
way This seems like a lot of commotion
 Well thank you so much for your time I
dont know what I could possibly do in return
other than offer my gratitude
 Yeah I go in
 You want the spine lift
 All right
 Oh thank you it was a pleasure I look
forward to coming your way again one of these days
 This is awfully nice
 Caduceus
 Keisha Its a pleasure
 I will wander back to the bees
 I think I come wandering in about the
point where theyre saying Hello bees because
this is really all I want
 What do you want me to say to them I
dont know
 Hold on hold on Let me do a thing
 Im going to take a little bit of the
tea out of my pocket Im going to try and get a
bloom going on my staff to try and get a flower to
start going on If I can get something to start
going a little bit It may not be temporary using
the Decompose I dont know if youll let me do that
 Well I can ask Hey guys I dont have
any flowers but I have some mushrooms I dont
know if youd be interested but youre welcome to
come over and take a look Its probably going to
rain pretty soon Its looking a little iffy
 Theyre working really hard right now
 Youve never seen bees before
 Wow
 We should fix that one of these days
 I got what I needed
 Is it possible to put some basic
supplies Is the ship already wellsupplied for a trip
 Id say a little bit of spice so that
the food that were creating doesnt taste too bland
 Would not be a bad idea because the
magicallycreated food is spongy
 This is his favorite thing to do to
hold a card and watch all of us wait for him to
show it to us
 Was is das Das ist gut
 Your body is a road map of pain
  Were going to find the
lost island of Teddy Ruxpin Im ready for this
shit Lets bring it
 Were going off the map man Probably
need a special boat for that
 Oh
 Cool
 I didnt know that people dont tell me
those sorts of things
 Oh they might I just might forget
 You may have already told me I dont
know
 I think thats a very good idea
 You made Caduceus laugh oh no Its not
even me laughing Well I can think of worse plans
than a nice bottle of wine with a card that says
Please dont stab me in the middle of the night
 You know I actually think that maybe
not giving them the idea in the first place might
be a better well yeah I think the big deal
will be when we finally do find a little money
making sure it spreads around a bit
 But bringing back some of the mead and
dispersing it amongst the crew is definitely a
sign that were probably going to do that when we
do That is very astute of you
 I have a confession I dont know what
astute means I heard one of the crew use it so
Im hoping it means a good thing
 I was mirroring something somebody else
said
 Okay yeah
 Youre looking for a sign
 Me too
 Well the skies were turning the wind
was coming in and I honestly have to mention my
knee hurts a little bit on the left side usually
about an hour beforehand It was a thing my sister
did It was  seasons ago give or take Shes a
piece of work Shes great A piece of work
 Yeah usually half a day before it
rains
 Yeah
 Thats an amazing list of things that
you are not
 I definitely could use some sleep
 Way to grab that first Not
CoreyTHall or you know He got right in there
Well done
 Thats the nicest way anyone has ever
put that thank you
 I think youre because the other one
missed so I think youre at
 Oh my god
 
 
  Did you get hit by
lightning
 Wow Hold on Oh man
 No thats nice Its fresh Hold on
Lets do something about that Im going to do
another quick Cure Wounds at a ridiculous level
Lets do it at third Lets give you another d
plus five to get that going What happened
 
 You got a sign
 I mean  Yeah thats a sign
You got hit Youre pretty fried
 I dont know how to make this sound
normal Did it know you Did it feel like it was
there for you
 Well somebodys paying attention
Congratulations You probably need some food
Wheres your sword
 Thats amazing Well now that you seem
to have the Stormlords attention now what
 Now what
 Ill go to the kitchen and put the
kettle on I think sometimes youre running toward
something so fast that you dont remember why you
were running in the first place Ive had some
moments like that with these people a couple
times where I felt distant from whats important
Recently Ive been thinking about this river in
the northern forest Its not a big river You
watch the river and every year its a little
different We used to make little leaf boats and
put them down and watch them and every year it
was a different path but its all going to end up
in the ocean eventually I think that youre going
to be ending up in your destination real soon I
think were barreling toward it Congratulations
Im going to go make tea  And I go make tea
 Zoinks
 Lets get some lemon juice and a
candle
 The ships name makes sense now
 The eater of balls
 Everybody Now I feel better about the
whole Its a good name It works out
 Been saving it
 Oh that no Although I did think
about it No this is from home This is the
Cadence family if I recall Its very minty
 I mean technically yeah
 Its true
 To surviving
 The mintiest
 Well work on it
 Eater of balls
 And now you have as well
 You just bested a ball
 We spent six days in that Happy Fun
Ball
 Thats a lot of balls
 This is practically a ball pit yeah
 Nice lightning strike as you said that
by the way It was like
 I was enjoying it
 Im not sure that elder gods work in
bakers dozens
 Youre welcome to stay although there
might be a conversation about how much of the cut
of whatever we find you get to keep
 Yep take a look
 Perception rolls
 Perception with advantage Thats awful
Thats terrible 
 Nothing so far Mr Caleb I know this
is not your favorite thing to do but we may
require the use of your friend for a little while
 Well I was hoping that maybe the cat
would get uncomfortable in either a bird or an
octopus form and do a little reconnaissance
 Were looking for signs of civilization
on land or in the sea at the moment What are you
 Your mind pictures
 Are you hoping for that Ladyhawke moment
where you have a furry octopus
 One pat of just 
 
 There you go bud
 Oh man
 Well we may need a nap before we go
down there
 But since the Yasha thing
 Oh in that case Im going to manage my
spells then
 Yeah lets do it separately
 Oh my god
 Ten
 Seems pretty clear
 Maybe if you washed it every now and
then it would have a slightly different
 Ill leave my tea kettle on board
Should be fine well find them
 Were all going to stare at you while
you do this
 The book was about debate and then you
were going to argue about
 Its a look
 No fear
 No straight roll
 Six
 Im going to do a little ping of Eyes of
the Grave just to make sure theres no more of
them in this other than the ones we can see
  feet
 I know that were heading once I feel
like or maybe I should hit it again
 Come on Ah better 
 
 Yeah I would have gotten an undead ping
from any of them I didnt get an undead ping
 Im relaying that to everybody very
quietly
 It looks dangerous I think its
worth
 Ill stick with you
 Just for fun Ill add into this with a
Sacred Flame
 See if we can knock one out
 Mine is a save against dex of 
  points of radiant damage
 Is that with advantage Oh
 Cricket
 
 Can you get down there and hold an
action
 Well done Youve already helped
 Whoa good to know Very low armor
class easy to hit which is usually dangerous
Theyre going to be trouble when they get in
there
 Do you want to have an action held
though
 Im going to move just behind Yasha Are
any of them within range at this point
  or 
 Then Im going to hold a spell until
theyre within range
 Im going to hold Bane
 Underwater
 Im going to hit three of them with
Bane
 Three of them with Bane Its a charisma
saving throw
 Im hitting the ones that have not been
hit
 Charisma
 Yeah Attacks and savings throws d
 Just the first one
 Negative d
 Oh wait no not that one Im so sorry
Not that one That one doesnt have the d
 Im going to keep my distance Im going
to back up a little bit and Im going to use
Sacred Flame on the one that is in combat with
Yasha Its dex save
 Do I want to do this Yeah Five points
of radiant damage
 Thank you  points of radiant damage
Thank you My brain is burnt
 Is that with a negative d
 Ruin everything
 I love Bane so much Where has it been
all my life Oh Its so hateful
 Reduced to half
 Does he get a bonus for that natural 
Does he get some sort of bonus to that natural 
Does that make something better about that
 I mean because Im going to cancel it
if it does anything
 Im canceling it
 Jesus
 Yeah no Im pretty uncomfortable about
all of this Yeah
 This is definitely getting very
afterschool special for me and the kid just
brought out the bag of weed in the afterschool
special and Im like Oh
 Oh the police officer came to our
school and talked about this Okay
 No  Yeah all right lets do
this
 I think that was the end of your ghost
friend
 No That was the end
 I mean they already know were here
 You want heavy in combat so you would
want
 Right as it begins
 Hey Look at that

Riegel in the room
 How do you have a dimple you have a
movie star chin dimple Its right there
 The tongue is saving a woman tied to a
railroad track
 We missed you so much
 Still littered with candy canes
 Tiny violin
 We saw them
 We dont know how many There were a lot
of them moving around
 I was going to say its been a while I
thought the plan was to draw things out through
the door
 Okay
 You guys get an extra d
 Get a d
 
 Wow I see how this is going Im going
to cast Bless and hit Caleb Nott and Jester
 So Im Blessing that and then Im going
to move out of the way Im going to go around
that rock and over to the side there Yeah
anywhere I can get over there get a little bit of distance
 Yeah probably go up a little bit I
want to be able to keep an eye on things
 No not cool
 A d attached to each attack roll
 One down
 Well talk about that other thing later
 Its been a few weeks
 Oh wait its an attack you get an
extra d
 Oh you did roll your d never mind
 Im going to use my bonus action to
throw a quick Healing Word at Beau
 Thats just six hit points sorry
 Then Im going to get a little bit away
from the tower Im going to try and stay in range
of that one but circle around away from these
fuckers
 Yeah around like that The one that has
Beau Im going to hold a Path to the Grave until
Yasha attacks Im going to hold my thing for
Yasha to hit it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I love Bless man
 Im not  feet away from that am I
 Damn it Okay never mind
 Is that with the d
 I see her attacking and Im
 Im fine either way
 Im fine man
 Yeah Im fine
 Man Things are happening Yeah Im
going to turn invisible
 Thats only for a round Then Im going
to back away from this thing Im actually going
to head around behind Jester basically
 That misses I also might add that I
have the Shield of Retribution
 Im going to activate the Shield of
Retribution
 Yep Its the first time Im using it
When a creature misses with a melee attack you
may react to the blast with arcane force You have
to succeed on a strength saving throw but thats
something else
 Okay Eh  points of damage
 It must succeed on a strength saving
throw is a six I dont know what against Must
succeed on a strength saving throw against
something
 Then I think thats fine yeah You get
pushed back  feet
 I dart around the side Im coming as
far back as I can towards that wall and Im going
to hold my actual action to do the same thing with
Yasha again to give her the bonus kick to her
first attack
 That will be my action yeah
 Will it bump into me
 How did it get so far Whats their
speed
 Oh fuck okay
 Do I have a reaction or did
 That is my reaction is to hold my
attack
 Okay Sorry
 First one doubles
 All the damage The first one is
doubled
 I also like that youre bleeding so
theres a perfect red corkscrew happening
 Hey
 Im going to Sacred Flame this guy Im
going to step back a little bit  feet
 Yeah Get rid of your stuff
 Oh that hits
 Okay I still get my attack though
  points of damage And constitution
saving throw Nine
 Sorry
 Make a dex saving throw
 All right thats nice Take seven
points of radiant damage
 Im all right I think everybody could
take a few minutes
 Thats true
 I can take ten minutes and give everyone
a little bit of a boost
 Ill look in the door before we sit
down Is this thing giving me a vibe
 Nature check oh no
 My nature check weirdly sucks
 Yeah I know its funny how my nature
check is terrible 
 It doesnt seem to be a problem Were
just going to be here for a minute and then well
be on our way Let me know if youve got any
issue and well do our best to stay out of your business
 
 I do Plant life needs love man
 Aw see now I feel better about the
whole thank you
 Anybody who needs a heal Im going to
do the tenminute Im going to start in the
interior of this the Prayer of Healing so anybody
who needs
 Can we afford a short rest
 I will not say no to a short rest
 Nothings looking for us
 Never mind Im not casting the spell
 No if were taking a short rest Thats
if you dont want a short rest but you want to
roll out
 We are not paying attention to things
 Is there something in the middle of all
that tendril in the center of this tower Is it
obscuring something
 Oh I suppose were going to be heading
down
 Were going to be having to head down
below Were going to try not to disturb your root
structure but if theres another way down that
you might happen to know of we would appreciate
any clue as to what that may be No shift in the
water nothing No little twitch
 I apologize to the interruption of your
very calm day
 We did a short rest so everybody
thumped Are you all right with where you are
 I mean we dont have the best history
but sure
 Yeah thats fair
 I dont know if well I mean place it
next to the seaweed see if it has any I dont
think this is carnivorous but its worth
checking
 No its not that kind
 Hows that door that we found in the
middle of the seaweed looking
 Ill go right after you too just in
case something goes wrong
 I dont think so I think that theyre
pretty friendly
 Fjord I think
 Sorry
 Im casting Light
 I can cast Water Walk if we have to
 Im taking a long look around during
this
 Ten
 Im going to point out Id be careful
Whatever this armor is it didnt seem to help
this fellow much
 I didnt think to put that in my bag for
this particular run
 Heres the question Do you do this
alone or do we stay here with you Were at a disadvantage
 Lets maybe keep a friend with Mister
Fjord We can keep eyes on him in the chamber
 Yeah
 Which I think itll be fine with just
Fjord and Frumpkin
 We could be outside up in the top layer
of the temple and wait for you whether or not
you need help or whether or not its time to
run
 Do you want to be in the room
 Well see through Frumpkin anyway
 Well be waiting for you upstairs
 If anything starts to go wrong well
try to get to you If youre encumbered well try
to clear a path and once youre up with us Ill
bring everybody to the surface
 No
 I feel like that signal happens a lot
though
 We hear it a lot
 I go last and on the way out I tap
Fjord on the shoulder Good luck and Im looking
forward to seeing you upstairs I cast Protection
from Good and Evil protection from evil
 You know what that does though
 Just in case
 Why dont we all get outside and be here
right now
 Whats your plus dex
 I think were pretty tightknit
 Are we all going up Lets go up Im
casting Water Walk on everybody including you
 Lets head to the ship
 Lets walk that way
 That was very nice
 We really got to do something about that
at some point
 Dont open it
 Its an acquired taste
 Do you want me to give them fair
warning
 I would say close enough
 Far
 And I still have a Control Water so
once theyre within  feet I can make their
life very unpleasant
 Im the boatswain
 Were all the boatswain
 Yeah what do you need
 So I can deal with the top two
 I still have some good spells
 Oh thats nice
 
 We usually get durian pastries after
BlizzCon
 Can we put them between us and land so
that maybe if we can ground them
 How clear is the
 Youll show us 
 I like that its got little rivets
 You can have mine I only do this to
myself once a year
 Captain lets hug the coast to our
right a little hard Maybe I can once they get
close enough shove them
 Yeah I can shove them into the rocks
maybe
 Get around that little piece of
 I cant do anything until theyre 
feet away anyway
 Because I would be doing this as well
can I give advantage to that or can I roll as
well on that No he has to roll on that
 Are they close enough now
 
 Now
 I am going to cast Control Water and
Im going to shove all the water Im going to
push them right into the island
 I cant quite tidal wave I can do
redirect flow or I can do whirlpool I think are
my two
 Its a wave
 Im throwing them on the island
 Thank you
 Percentile
 I got them so the yep
 
 Its just water Im going to sit down
That was really tiring
 We can also see what they have on board
 Im so sorry
 Oh I am so sorry
 Youre not shooting that great anyway I
think probably this was for the best
 Not anymore theyre not
 Yep Im here to fuck your shit up I
will make sure you will never get to shoot a cannon
 Oh no
 That I can help with We should
maybe
 Who can tie
 We can do that It would take a day
though I cant really do anything until the morning
 It could also give you a second to go
and take a look at the wreck of that ship maybe
I mean you can swim
 You not feeling it
 Yeah weve got some stuff
 Food and water never stops if you need
it too
 Whoa thats a lot
 Pay the crew
 Wow
 Jesus

 Vandran Hm
 Perhaps the tower the strange tower
that grows Perhaps theres answers in there or
someone who might know
 Well I know the Wildmother knows
everything
  Sure
 Now Im thinking about that
 Does it
 Are you sure
 Oh thats nice Thinking about this
 I think you smell fantastic
 Thank you But no really I actually do
think you smell better than nice
 Weve got a tree until we need it
 Thats a lot of tree
 Do you need above average Are you
already bumped
 Im in a breastplate
 Either of you would get a bonus to that
 Either of you would be hilarious owning
this
 Its one fight just become a beast
 Yeah
 Yeah youll get disqualified from a lot
of sports for taking that Thats for horses
 Not yet One day
 Im going to gather some of my stuff and
go to the crows nest Get everybody
 Yeah
 Im not going to be reading up there
but
 Ill admit Im not the best reader but
Ive read a couple books
 I would be curious
 If you could leave it in my quarters
that would be most agreeable
 Thank you
 Me too Ive never felt so helpful Im
going to climb up and set up a little ritual
circle in the crows nest and Im going to light
some incense and Im going to pull out a piece of
that weird fruit that Ive been slowly growing
some mushrooms on getting a little weird eat a
little bit of it Im going to meditate and then
Im going to cast Divination
 Im going to feel out into the universe
and Im going to wait for whatever sign whether
it be verbal or otherwise
Wonder what Vandrans doing right now
 Thatll do
 I head back down
 Im good
 Im going to read that book too but
yeah well talk about it later
 On the Balleater
 Like a badass
 Its really cool and its going to
happen
 Thank you next
 Sure Ill go for my standard shaggy
redheaded mess
 Who are you My god
what happened to Beau
 Baller move
 Ive had a thing Ive been wanting
to do for a while and I figure now is
possibly the time to take care of this
I want to find a blacksmith
 Well its not often that I have a pet
project I havent had one in a while and that
was the way I used to keep myself excited and busy
back when I was home so Ive got a pet project
Its been a while
 I pull out the broken sword hilt that I
have
 Id love to see about getting this
fixed maybe as a token of appreciation for
Mr Fjord for doing such a good job taking
care of himself on his own quest and
not getting sidelined into some bad thoughts
 I also dont know
how to find a blacksmith
 Metal box
 I dont know Ive never had a metal box
before
 What do you do with it
 Oh were getting so afar You just
mimed a metal box
 Thats amazing Youre very talented
 Theres a joke in there
 If the people looking for a bookstore
find a blacksmith they can send a little Message
and if the people looking for a blacksmith find a
bookshop I assume we should buy everything we see
 Yes I was looking to have a sword
repaired a very unusual sword
 Uthudurnian
 No thats good to know Would you know
of anyone who could point us in the right
direction or would we have to
probably venture that direction
 North of the Empire
 Well now
 Thats barely twoandahalf
three feet I mean whats the scale on that
Its like onehalf scale double
 Wow
 We may be sitting on this for a little
while Thats good to know thank you friend
 Thank you heres a couple coin for your
trouble anyway I throw three gold at him
 You would call that the Beau bo
 Would be Beaus bo
 You could put a bow on the bo
On Beaus bo
 You too as well
 Thats interesting We have to
take care of that at some point
 Great Nicodranas Bake Off
 Well meet you there and maybe talk
about tomorrows thing I think were probably
going to want to take a look at that tower
while were in town
 I said it anyway

 Im so excited for our next campaign Youve
already created a backstory for your next character
 Little boy with a knife
 He flew the coop
 That was bad I dont feel
good about that
 Yeah no if were all here
 Two rooms ought to cover it for us
 How long are we going to be maybe just
a couple nights maybe at best Theres a few
things we should do in town before we head
 I would definitely prefer to wait
as well Im a fan of taking a minute
to take a look around and have a plan
 Probably not Probably it wore off
 If anything youre mocking her
 Anything interesting on the wall
 Just for fun Detect Magic
 Anything sparkly
 Thats fair Anything behind the counter
look particularly interesting
 Yeah I mean
 As long as I can Im not going to
break a rule or anything but yeah
 All right
 Ill chip in for this yeah
 I mean we should distribute them to
other people
 Ill chip in for how many do we have
now
 Three basic healing potions Ill chip
in for one
 Miss Sheila I had a question
 I was curious about any magical items
you might have for sale I got a vibe that you
might have something here that might be
interesting
 Do you have anything thats not for
sale thats just for show
 Is that a yes or no on the
 What is casing
 Thats nonsense were very likeable Is
there something in your eyes Do you have a
problem I can
 This is why you did the talking Have a
nice day
 Finally calmed down everythings fine
This is a holdup Empty your wallets
 I dont even

 Am I there
 I was trying to remember if wed split
for the two I do have a magic tree
 I drop it on the ground and a foot
tree immediately appears
 Yep
 Its a five foot thick tall tree
 While he does that Im going to just
walk the tower with my hand on the tower and see
if I feel any change at all
 We were hoping to make an appointment
with
 Is it possible to maybe move that up
into a very quick emergency meeting
 We have to leave town and will not back
for quite a while
 Its time sensitive
 I have genuine questions for this
person
 For the things I want Okay Im
boasting a little Deception right
 All right thats fair
 Eight
 Does the Blooming Grove mean anything
 With an axe in your hand going Who are
you
 To be fair you probably havent had
meat in quite a while because I havent been
cooking it
 Yep
 Really
 Yep
 I dont know I liked it
 Ride it I approve of this This is
great
 I think also since you seem to be
leaning towards honesty Im always a big fan of
honesty being the best way to approach these Or
as much of the truth as is possible at any moment
 Im always happier to omit than lie if
we have to Lyings weird
 Huh I dont know what that means but I
agree
 Too much has been happening here
 Potion I bought is for Caleb so Caleb
gets the healing potion
 Were going to the tower tomorrow
 I have some legitimate questions about
things that I am curious about and we do actually
own some objects that maybe we should have
a learned man take a look at
 Mine is
 Yeah
 There seems to be a lot of weird
things happening
 You can be a lot lower
 We were hoping for an audience
if you have time this morning
 We came by yesterday and we
were told it might be best to come back
in the morning We brought tea
 Yes he said to come back
in the morning
 We dont have Earl Grey I dont think
 We dont
 Im a fine teamaker
 We feel a bit exposed I would admit
 Mr Deep Lore
 Im going to pull a pouch of my better
tea and Im not really sure what to do with it
 Have you ever heard of
The Blooming Grove
 This tea is made from a flower
that only grows there in the north
from one of the original families
Its very rare
 Youre making a big assumption
that word can leave
 Lets not Its either probably
you or me I suppose I dont know
 Lets get all the things we might
want to show him together really quickly
 I want the dodecahedron
 Well talk about it
 We have the
 Do you trust me
 Okay you keep it but
 Yes please
 Yes please
 And I may with your permission
mention what we have Thank you
 Only if it leads to something better
 Try and be good
 I feel like between Beau and I
we cover everything very well
 I dont need it
 No were going in
 Brewed or unbrewed Just ready
to be brewed
 Im going to check to see if theres
tea brewed and if there isnt Ill brew tea
 I will brew some tea
 The tea is indeed ready
 Stick to what we know for now
 Thank you Ill leave some extra
for later
 That family was one of the first four
I think it may have been the Graves actually
which is ironic the more I think about it
Each tea is made mystically from a family
that is buried within our graveyard
 I didnt I was told
 There are a lot of strange things
all happening in congruence
 Start with the least interesting
and work your way up I suppose
 I actually have it if I recall I grabbed
it from you Im going to put it on the table
 Odd
 Things keep stumbling upon us
 Things that should not be Things are
becoming misplaced that should not be misplaced I
feel like that fact that we have this means that a
powerful magic user is no longer available People
of great power going missing and getting
attacked The tower All these things
 Apparently if I recall
is no longer with us now
 Theres more Im going to show
the sword just because this is odd
And there was also The grove is dying
 I dont know Perhaps I asked
the Wildmother for guidance and it brought
me to this That certainly sparks my interest
 Yes
 Do you know anything of its sister
temples Of whether they hold or not If
 There is no reason for this
magic to be diminishing Its very odd
Why would it be diminishing
 That would be odd in itself
 The last thing Well I dont know Im
not going to say it because youre the smart one
but I think perhaps it is worth mentioning the
thing you saw when the tower fell the thing that
was being ferretted the thing you saw
I dont know how to best describe it
 I think that would be a longer
conversation for when you have time if you feel
like investing in what were doing and
how were moving about the world
 We need people who are
better than ourselves
 To the Wildmother
 She has allegiances to us
 As Ive spent some time with these
people they are people of the world but Ive
found Ms Beau and the rest of them to be loyal to
each other which I find to be a very admirable trait
 Ms Beau is not as used to speaking
plainly as some of us are Its okay One of your
better attributes is your ability to talk around
something We need friends We need assurances
We would like to know that you are a good and
trustworthy person and we would respectfully
like to trade perhaps some information
and have a friendly face on the coast
we would be most grateful for
 Yes The others do not know I believe
how things may change soon and I think it would be
good And I think theyre going to turn well I
think theyre going to turn out very well but I
think it would be good to have the right
people in the corner when it is time
 Information for the moment
 About the things in our possession
powers that we are tapping into
the people we may come across
 Our host is aware of our positions and
otherwise I would ask that everyone try and be
respectful of the space Try not to break
anything steal anything or otherwise
 Try not to
 I stood up and waved everybody in
 Oh
 And Im Caduceus
Again its a pleasure
 I would ask just so that it doesnt
get me into trouble with my compatriots
that I convinced that honesty and
forthrightness was the best policy
 I was hoping for perhaps a trade so
that they felt that they got something back in
return It doesnt have to obviously be so
dangerous If you have something that at least
they can feel like they can hold something
in the meantime
 Im by the way already putting the
ball on the table and leaving it by the tea tray
as we have this discussion I have definitely
moved it to the center of the room
 We can let you know what we saw inside
 Did we ever get confirmation
on the owners death or did we not
 That we I think we feel also would be
something that we would be interested in doing
once we feel even more comfortable with
this arrangement and once trust is built
 Obviously you are so much more
powerful than we are that it would
behoove us to be a little careful
 I mean really he probably could
 I have a
 Would it be possible to get an
assurance that we could leave this place
with it and that no harm would come to us
 It does
 Im willing to take a certain
person at their word
 No matter what Also we would
appreciate it if you would not speak of who owns
this artifact with anyone If you have to discuss
the artifact thats one thing but we would
prefer us to be anonymous Its a dangerous
world And it would show great trust
 Bring more the next time I go
home if theres a home to go to
 Its time to trust somebody
 Its the iron safe and then yeah
 I got Banishment on hold just in case
 Thats very good to know I hope that
now that you understand how much we appreciate
your gesture of trust and how much
 Jester of trust And how much
we are putting our faith that you are on
the side of good and right if
 Thatll do
 We would appreciate any information
that you may glean about this Ukotoa Traveler
the Blooming Grove I am of the belief that these
things are connected that these chaotic forces
are moving towards something unsettling
and unbalancing
 I saved you a biscuit
 A lobster biscuit That a thing
 Lobster biscuit is a thing
 He said we were foolish
 He said we were foolish
 I dont believe you
 Its true
 We are lucky were not dead But we are
also lucky that going forward were going to get
you access to learn more and to grow in an avenue
you didnt have open to you before
 I think hes going to be a if he isnt
the death of us I think hes going to be a good
ally But somethings going to be the death of
us and its better just to trust a few people
 We didnt bullshit
 I will actually
 I watched Beau tell the truth
It was very impressive Youre not very
good at it but it was very impressive
 Yeah I could tell you were struggling
 You were honest without oversharing
 Were going to need a day to get
ourselves together anyway We dont have
were going to have to put everything together
So why dont you just
 Why dont you just spend some time
with your family and well get the cart together
and get the supplies together
 Set off
 You made a good call
 Oh thats No Yeah
thats the Okay
 Why are you saying hyah
 Yeah Ive got them right here but
 Roll for initiative
 Well it ought to be on a day that
You should use the mote
 No
 This is the invisible cart but
we told them how it worked last time
And well do the same thing this time
 Oh yeah Its to ward off bandits
makes it a little easier to Feel free though
its just an illusion on the cart
 On a fast one I want to take a moment
on the first night also to let Fjord know
I just want to let you know that while were
on the sea I had a talk with my goddess
and that friend of yours is still out there
 Yeah that old friend of yours that
you havent seen in a while Whats his name
 Yeah thats the one
 I asked the Wildmother
 I feel like I would be speaking to
things I didnt necessarily know about I dont
entirely know the Traveler nor entirely understand
what the Traveler is but I know the Wildmother
 Yeah Making amends
whatever that means
 One way or another
 Its a very particular flavor of
goodness that come from those who are
offered so much temptation I have some
faith in you Back to the horses
 What Oh god
 This is everything I liked about
both those characters happening all at once
It was amazing just amazing
 Is Gustav still in the town or has
he left town Just out of idle curiosity
 Just while were there
 Mmhmm 
 Thatll do
 Greatest show on Earth
 Cool
 They stole whatever it was
they were trying to steal I guess
 Hi by the way
 Good to see you again
 Actually would a letter of good note
get us any further in case we run into anybody
 I dont know
 Its worth asking I suppose
 Hyah
 Lets go guys
 The horses are going to go if I
ask them to
 Yeah
 Thank you Aww thats so nice
 Aww thats so exciting
 Wow
 It never even occurred to me that you
get a book about cooking Thats so great
 Yeah the illustrations are amazing
Yeah Oh this is cool Aww thank you
 Im going to do my best to make
it through this mushroom cookbook
 Ive often wondered
 Ill human up for a second
 Youve got a lot of reading
to do this weekend
 Fuck man
 Percys in my head dissecting that title
so hard right now I cant though I dont know
 As long as youre in the back
they cant see
 Were moving on anyway
 Im going to do a general look
around to see if I can get a sign of life
coming from anywhere in the rubble
 Lighting it up in here
 Huh You know what that makes me
think of I mean that seems thats weird
 I figured you would know
because Im guessing
 Well whats your opinion
 Thats way better than mine
Never mind
 I was thinking that maybe there was
an invisible person tied to the chair
 I really appreciate that
I was a little spooked
 Youre tearing me apart
 No hidden ones nothing
 Yeah Ill help
 That chest its probably trapped
We should be very careful
 Later somewhere else
 Somewhere else
 Anything else in the chest
 Is there any way to
cover our tracks here
 I got that Come on Im going to
pick up Caleb Youre not at fault here
Youre the solution here You know that
right Were here to fix this Dont let
her anger its not about you
This is not about you
 Can we relock the chest
 I think we should try and lock
everything up and maybe break the chair
 Right now
 I want to try and Theres no way to
Actually Im going to try and lock the chest
again when we leave Im going to use
not magically obviously but Thaumaturgy
to close it and lock it or will that
not work with Thaumaturgy
 Lets have this conversation elsewhere
This place is creeping me out
 I think were I think we should
 We need to go now
 I have cleaned it up
I have beetles they eat things
 We took everything Were going
 Lock it as well
 Sure Lets get away from here
 Lead the way Were going to
move the cart You need to not panic
 Not right around here no
 Cart
 I dont want the cart parked in front of
the creepy rubble house Im going to move it
 Were going to get in the cart
and move now
 I was looking forward to a
shopping episode This was really good
 This was good guys
 Yeah no this was nice and gentle
 I was waiting for the Riegel shoe
to drop man

 Hey were going to use a chair
Thats so exciting
 Wow dude Wow As Beau might say Wow
Wow
 We are a target
 I think we need somewhere safe to talk
I think theres a lot of things we need to cement up
 No obviously not We need privacy
 Not me no secrets open book
 Does your husband know
Does he not know
 So he knows youre alive
 Hell know you Nott you ran and got
help and here we are Its the right thing to do
Were here to help
 Were here now
 We just have to take some time
think carefully and slowly
 We can do something about this but
youre going to have to trust us and youre going
to have to be careful because if we move too
quickly were just going to go running the
wrong direction and alone And you need help
 Would it help if we cleared your head
 Well if you need a minute to be here
we maybe sift some of the contents of that flask
out of you for a little while Just for a minute
You can get back to it when you need it
but for now maybe impulse may not be
your friend right now
 Im going to try and do that We had a
brief conversation about that last week
 Yeah
 I have to know what it is
I have to be going for it
 I am so sorry
 Sometimes the truth takes a little while
to get there
 Yeah
 Maybe somewhere where
we can sleep too
 We know that there are tunnels
 Well maybe we should find somewhere in
town to hold up and well keep you out of sight
 Whats your husbands name
 I think perhaps if were going to we
should come together with a game plan I think it
would be respectable if people thought that
someone was looking for Yeza in his interests
People will be less suspicious if were asking
questions about someone who disappeared if we
were perhaps hired by a trust fund of your son or
otherwise and this is something that is owed to him
Its just business we dont have to let them
know its personal
 Thats a lot You can take
your time As youre ready
 Ill also say we can start the wagon
up and I can drive and keep an eye out If youre
all inside the wagon no ones going
to see any of you
 It may be in the end safer staying in
town People staying in the woods seem like
theyre trying to avoid something and theres a
lot of soldiers If youre on business you go to
town even if the towns a little rough Well
keep going around When its time to go I think
maybe we go into town and get a room Maybe
make a little bubble in the room if we have to
 Were going to take a scenic route
Ill take a long time and if I see people
Im not going to drive towards them
 It was very brave
 Anywhere west really
 Not a bad idea
 I dont know if necessarily crossing the
border is the way to go but at least going
further inland
 Safe as anything
 Thats not a bad idea Send a letter
Ask Bryce if they can take care of this
 I imagine if we pack a few gold in
Its not much to find some room and board for a
couple people
 Or send word
 Stop
 Stop
 I mean thats what you would do
if youre doing the telegram
 Stop
LAURA Right Okay Im going to cast Sending
 Signed oh
 Water in the ear
 Its nothing
 I also want to get a sense of things so
were going to take a lazy meander around the
area I want to get a sense of where things are
get a map in my head and Im going to be
paying very close attention
 No on the outskirts
 Im going to keep going around
until they
 Thats okay its all right Eight
Wait no Im so sorry thats wrong 
 All right Does it look like theyve
discovered the tunnels or no
 Thatll be for civilization
thats cool
 Im on the lookout and I will let
anybody know if anyones within  yards
 I think Im listening but Im not doing
a very good job of it
 Because Im
  Shut up Travis
 Uh yeah Ill have some if someones
making something

 Very offcamera
 Hey if you all dont stop arguing Im
going to turn this cart right around
 I dont know if you were arguing Ive
just always wanted to say that
 Man
 Im going to start heading back to town
regardless its getting cold
 Its like you two have been reading
Tumblr This is so Sorry carry on
 Wait what You trying to find out if
someones alive
 I can do that
 Moms gone wild What Hmm
 I would just I have a little ritual in
the morning meditate on it see if I can feel
anything tugging in some direction and I couldnt
know much but I could know something
 Its a divine force but I dont
think that it would
 Well I mean Id have to sleep
 I couldnt know much But I could maybe
at the very least give you a yesno Maybe
 Well Im happy were coming to town to
talk to this famous alchemist and this has really
thrown something into our plans I dont know
what Do people throw monkeys into plans
What do people throw
 A wrench Yeah this has wrenched
our monkey
 Hmm not a bad idea
 Im already heading that way
 I think Ive still got a little bit of time
on my shaggy redhead Wait no Am I out now
 Crownsguard is probably our best bet if
some of the people were looking for happen to be
still missing in the aftermath then
 All right
 This is going to sound weird but is
there a florist around Or anybody who deals with
exotics Exotic herbs plants or otherwise
 Something exciting
 Im looking forward to a little quiet
 I need something Its nice to have
something complicated to use to focus myself
 Mm
 Not quite but yeah
 Anything Preferably some sort of flower
or living plant but if its
 The notion is Im looking for something
that is a testament to the abilities of the
Wildmother so anything that is a gift from her to
us Something impressive something beautiful
something tasty
 Ive never tried honey I dont know if
it would work but thats interesting
 I usually tend to stick a little closer
to the source I also dont really necessarily
know how I would perform the ritual with honey
 I honestly dont know the difference
between molasses and honey
 Tree poop and bee poop
 That might be interesting but I
think I should probably see if theres
anything around possibly
 Im not sure how that relates but
that is a very beautiful feather
 Do you want to roll Okay no Ill roll
it because my investigation is amazing
Here we go Come on Ah Thats a natural 
That brings me to a thats a  then
 Im hoping to find an orchid or
something Something interesting
 Its as if you knew what I was doing
Thank you  Thank you and here goes
 gold Thats all I needed to do really 
That was my pregame
 That soldier was totally hitting on
you
 He wasnt even here when the fighting
happened He was lying Sorry So brave Sorry
 Oh oh Is there a furniture maker in
town Because I really would like to ask them
questions about that chair
 Im done Im done Im good This is my
attempt to rally everybody It worked I swear
Dont look at me like that jesus
Oh god theres just dicks over there
I dont know what to do
 Just potential dicks now Thats better
 Still we should at least investigate
this lead now and tomorrow if we dont know
whats going on I can and I warn you I will do
this but Im going to get a little exhausted
doing it I can at least give us some sense of
whats ahead
 Lets take a look at these tunnels Im
actually very curious about this
 Well get a little food and then well
check it out by night
 It wasnt our intention but things
being what they are this seems to be the
new reality of the world doesnt it
 I can walk through stone
 I mean Id want to know where I was
going and I can only go alone
 I would imagine so as well
 Just honey all the way back
 We should have this conversation in here
because I want to take a look around in this thing
 Yeah they offered us
 Light
 Its all in the stone
 I mean yeah Unless anybodys got an
objection
 No Im just walking
 Oh is that true Oh I didnt know
that Well I dont have that as an option
right now anyway
 Theres no marking on it This is an
obviously organicallycarved tunnel
 The footprints going in and out theres
nothing
 Wow Never really done one of those 
 In both directions
 All right Interesting Very
interesting They were definitely in here
and they definitely left this way
 My radar What do you mean
 Detect Magic
 Nothing really Just for fun because
we can Eyes of the Grave too Just for fun
 No I figured Nothing
 We could message
 In the morning and I cant guarantee
this but well at least know if hes alive and
maybe a sense of whether or not hes above ground
or below ground and thatll certainly inform our decision
 Maybe Ill glean what I can but
its a soft process
 Im going to try something really
quickly just for fun Im going to use
Thaumaturgy really quickly and Im going to
broadcast a low bass chant and Im going to
throw it as far forward down that tunnel as I
possibly can to see if I can get some sort of
vibration coming back that they can hear Im
going to start throwing this 
If theres air to vibrate or Im making sound in
solid rock as a boosting of your It may not work
 Trying to use some sort of nature theory here
 You can get really loud Thats the
question is can I get loud enough to hear myself
like if I was trapped in there Or am I yeah
 Straight wisdom check 
 Honestly Im going to try and see and
cut it off to see if theres an echo coming
through the rocks basically in that split second
 Into it 
 How deep are we underground right now
 Okay cool Im just going to do that
Im not going to inform anybody of anything that
 Thank you for that
 Wow That was good
 I tried to get a sense if there was
something beyond that
I dont know I got a hint of something
 I think maybe theres
something past that wall
 I cant know that until dawn If we do
decide to go that direction I think that there is
definitely a chance that we could dig far enough
and deep enough to make passage
 Well know tomorrow
 Does make one wonder why they
havent done that yet
 This is all very confusing
 Do we want to poke this thing tonight
or do we not
 Not the tunnel I mean
 We have an object We have another
object Maybe we havent really I mean I doubt
that we really understand what we have but
 I mean we have these things right now
 I kind of do
 I suppose
 Ill follow the group but
  Im here because where I was I was
out of options Weve definitely found some
options I dont know what they mean yet but
I went looking for them and here we are
 Thats right Has been for a while The
forest that surrounds it the corrupted forest is
overtaking it as if the magic that held it in
place is being supplanted Im of the opinion that
that shouldnt be happening There are several
other were not the only site like our own
We havent had much communication with the other
sites so I dont know if its happening anywhere else
 I wouldnt even know who to send it to
Were supposed to protect that place
and I was running out of ideas
 My family
 Oh lots I mean depending on when and
where Members of my family and others have been
protecting that place for as long as it has
existed We built the temple We founded it
 No they all left
 Yeah and none of them have come back
 Not really
 I feel like she would let me know if I
needed to know Thats not an answer I really want
the thats not an answer Im looking for
right now Im sure you understand
 Best to have faith and not second guess
how shes decided to move forward If I recall
Corin talked about trying to find some of the
other temples but I dont know No ones come
back When you came around I had an inkling that
it was supposed to be my job to do this from the
beginning and that I had been shirking my duties
You all seemed like a very good sign that
it was time to take some responsibility
 Those who knew me called me Geoff

 Its a good name Spelled it with a
G
 Ive got nothing to hide
 G Whats wrong with you Dont
even
 Now I have anxiety I may not sleep tonight
now Its a lot of pressure to put on a person
 Oh this is caffeinated
Im going to be up all night Yeah
 I just want home back I want to know
that its safe again
 Youre always welcome where I live
 Until youre ready for something else
 What is their real name
 Youve been lying
You dont even have a leg to stand on

 Here to bring the awkward
 Im going to find an appropriate spot

somewhere quiet somewhere with a view somewhere
where the Wildmothers work is well at hand
 Mmhmm
 Youve entirely thrown me
 Yeah I was going to basically go for
the same thing I did last time if that still suits
Unless you would like me to shift a little bit
for your own
 A goal Hmm
 Yessa I want to make sure Im
getting the name right right
 Yeza I sit make my circle What is
Yezas destination Pushing a few days forward
 Ghor Dranas
 Thats all I have
 Probably
 Seems silly to move someone who isnt
 We may get lucky if we go into the
tunnel They may still be preparing at some point
to head in that direction Theyre not there yet
 They havent made it that far yet though
Its where they will be not where they are
 The north is looking interesting
 I think troubles going to close up
on us no matter what
 I feel like it might be a sign
 Weve got a cart Im not even kidding a bit
 Ill also say its not the worst of the
war right now is Ghor Dranas Thats past it
 Its the war room
 Also in tunnels built for war Thats
the thing Theres no fighting the war
 We dont have to Thats the thing
 Its really not about that though is it
 Im also I will admit not feeling very
positive about the tunnels But we should take a
look because the other option is the cart
 I believe you gave them quite a bit
of money
 Theres probably people coming and going
on most of these roads who are used to
moving people across
 Scarred for life
 Youre good with kids I imagine
 Yep
 Total
 Do you want advantage on that
or do you want me to join you
 All right Trying to be good about this
Thats 
 No elves all right
 Not with intense gravitas
 I assume that we live in a Liefeld
universe where as youre born
you accumulate pockets slowly all over you
 All the way down the ankle yeah
 Im so sorry Im all out
 Lets head to the tunnel and if that
doesnt pan out well start heading north
 We honestly first have to even see if
its possible to get in there
 I have a funny feeling that this is less
of a we can walk all the way to Albuquerque as
more as a theres possibly something down there or
theyre still in there thats just a little bit of a
 I dont think theyve been moving the
whole time
 We pinged something in the center cave
and we just needed to reconvene before we
came back to take a look at it
 Actually hell keep talking like this
if we dont get him to work
I dont know how that I dont really
 Im on you Fjord and I
 We dont really know what this is going
to look like yet
 Are you going to be all right
 Whats big A tiny gopher
 Wait a minute Can you make people bigger
 Can you make a honey badger bigger
 Wait
 Dont be an elk
 You rolled really well though
 Hit the view yeah there you go
 I get lost in here so I feel it
 Im going to cast Bless on the honey
badger just to see if that will help
Im going to Bless the honey badger
 Im going to start tapping on the walls
of that tunnel Well no
That tunnels really thin If we can
 And Bless
 Add your plus four your d
 Minecraft
 No
 Im not I dont know where we are
 Youd have to flip around and come back
I suppose
 Do not send the cleric into the pit of
the unknown
 We have all the dumb shit we shouldnt
have
 At the last second
 Im going to be the last one Whos the last
one going through the tunnel before we head over
 Yeah Weve just gotten access to a
small pocket that were just going to check out
make sure everythings safe and appropriate Well
have a full report once weve finished taking a
look inside and well be delivering it But in the
meantime lets not cause any undue panic
Well let you know or well make some noise if
anything dangerous is down there It still could
not be safe Youre welcome to come but Im not
sure if its going to be I cant guarantee any
safety beyond this point
 Okay thank you Okay thats a 
 Thank you sir I appreciate everything
that you do and
 If things go real wrong youll
definitely hear us
 Ill make sure that hes quiet because
we dont mind losing him
 I appreciate that
 Crazy like a badger 
Im into it
 Mmhmm
 Out of curiosity those crystals feel utterly
natural right It just feels like those were not
 All right
 Seven
 All right
 Im thinking about Detect Nah
 Just before we move on is anyone
bothered by these crystals Is this
 Im a little out of my element
which is surprising to say
 Its difficult because we dont really
understand how they work
 All right
 Lets all prepare to be a little
confused by whatever we find
Were going to be way out of our element
 If we start to hear something
 Tourist trap
 Lets go
 Were going to take a long rest at some
point I mean were moving but were going to
obviously have to sleep
 We might find a portal down here
you dont know whats here
 A tiny subterranean boat
filled with gummy bears
 Three
 Constitution modifier autoadds
 Im already going for it
 Im doubling the range of my spellcasting
 Yep
 I want to be able to heal
from a great distance
 When you cast a spell that requires
you to make an attack roll the spells range is
doubled Your ranged spell attacks ignore half
cover and threequarter cover You learn one
cantrip that requires an attack roll choose the
cantrip from the Cleric or Druid spell list Your
spellcasting ability for this cantrip is wisdom
 Oh really
 Oh that may change my decision then
 Or like Bane or Bless it doesnt help
 Okay that changes things
I may play with that
 Ive literally taken it twice already I mean
I had options but I dont remember what
they are off the top of my head
 Its the thief of oneshots
 Or the vending machine is running
against him
 I would like to know which one of you is
hitting the rotating knives first is what he is
 I just figured that out okay Not even
kidding
 Im very perceptive but I cant see in
the dark
 No we should probably keep a little bit
of distance
 Ill stick with you All right
 Also we should probably have Yasha up
front as well
 Probably not
 It would still be in a big metal case
until they really went through
 No harm in focusing on the positive
 Nothing we can do about it
 We cant make a plan until we
know what were up against
 And if theyre too much then well
just get what information we can maybe
sneak in while theyre sleeping and scurry out
with what we need with no harm no problem
 I really like it
 We did find some earlier
 Like a goat maybe
 Is that true
 Stop laughing DM Thats not funny
 Thats an eight My nature sucks
 Okay thank you I didnt need to roll
to know that
 At some point we do need to rest
 Mr Caleb what time is it
 Nope
 So glad its one I can answer
 Im going to cast Light behind
the crystal
 I couldnt help myself
 Im listening very carefully to see if
anything any noise is coming from the next room
 With advantage no just perception
 That is a 
 Kill the light again
 Well turn it back on but I
 Is there any part of the wall that is
still stone and not crystal
 I can carve out a chunk of wall if we
want to put your little dome inside
 Oh so in that case thats
pretty cool then Ill
 Once you build it Ill use Stone
Shape to cover it then so you can give it
a little bit of a shell
 Once he puts up the dome the shack
Im going to use Stone Shape to cover it really
quickly with a thin layer of rock
to make it look
 Earthen Its not like five feet thick
of rock but a couple inches to blanket it
 Its going to have a faux front
 Oh yeah its going to be an opening
 Probably put it against so we can see
whats behind I dont know what do you think
 Im going to pull the rock that I used
for that front from the wall and Im going to
give us a couple feet in if thats possible just
to push something Ive been looking at
Stone Shape and what itll do
 Thats what the thread the thread will
wake us if it
 Lighting it up again because its nice
 Yeah we already did it
 
 I did not prepare for that
 There was a river
 Well thats a good sign That means
that this is at least a natural cavern which
means its been here for a long time and
whatevers above hasnt disturbed it
 Thats good Thats a good sign
 Yeah Im going to have a little
light and see if I can find any tracks or
anything for this thing or any other footprints
 I got a 
 Does it smell clean is it clear
 Can I see the bottom
 Ill keep an eye on the back
 
  for me as well
 This is going to be
 And a bite
 The damage seems to take
 Thank god
 Is it close enough
 That hits
 Okay good to know No this
is good So were not going to waste time
trying to be safe from these things
 Again what does grappled mean
It means I cant move
 Okay and I cant move
 Thatll do
 Hes within  feet of me isnt he
 All right Im canceling
the natural 
 But the critical does not take
 Oh its not a damage Oh never
mind So it doesnt get anything special
 Okay no if its not doing
anything then theres no point
 I am panicking just a little
 Is it time to start having the
flashbacks Are we at flashback point
 Okay thats going to be interesting
 Cancelled
 Its actually not a Channel Divinity
Its called Sentinel at Deaths Door
 No its five times per long rest
 As long as Im within  feet of
somebody who suffers a critical hit you can
turn that hit into a normal hit Any effect
triggered by the critical hit is canceled
 Five times per long rest
 Wait should I
 Okay Its about to get worse
for them
 Ill take it Slow down cowboy
Im casting Bane on these two
 The save is a  charisma
 Yep I didnt think they would be
 That means that you have to take a
negative d to attack rolls and saving throws
 On both of them Im going to
then spend my bonus action and
Im going to call a swarm of insects Im
going to drop it on the lets get one of
these out of the way first Lets get the
one thats far away from me
Im going to drop it right on him That
swarm of insects is going to take a bite
 Hard to hit Lets see if I can
actually hit because my tohit is
 Oh well thats exciting
  is the highest hit
 This is a bite attack which is
d Hit ten d piercing damage
Its ten plus d I believe
 Why does it say ten
I dont know
 Oh  Thats ten
 That finishes my turn
 The d Wait and also is there
anything else he gets from Slow for saving throws
 How long does that thing stay
 Why dont we all prepare
I havent put my insects away
and we can just kill this thing off really
 I still have a swarm of insects
Im for the moment
going to keep my insects down there
just in case
 Is it back to exactly
where it was before
 Its immediately attacked
by an insect swarm
 
 Ten points of damage
 Im also going to throw
Sacred Flame at it
 Oh yeah it is  feet
 When do the insects get another
attack Thank you
 Spare the Dying Oh wait
sorry Sacred Flame
 Nope 
  points of damage
 With vague interest
 Drop it
 Now that thats done Im going to
start doing a ten minute heal for whoever
Who needs a heal
 Im going to start a ten minute
while you guys dig
 Who needs healing by the way
Okay so just you two
  points of healing
 We could command it to carry us
We could ask it politely to carry us
 We never used the magic words
to be fair
 Please thank you
It gets you so far
 If you want I can Stone Shape
I can push us in a
 Im going to carve a hole about
the size of what we need so we can be
pressed into the wall
 It might be too big for me to carve
 Oof
 I cant eat this I cant floss
theres all sorts of things people cant do
 Oh yeah I cant do all sorts
of things when Im eating
 Yeah I had that spell set up Sure
 That was going right into it
 How big are they
 Wouldnt maybe if you were traveling
these caves you wouldve capped them because of
things that kept popping out of the wall
 What
 Ive got a light Does it look like
these were Im going to go up to one
and examine it Do I hear anything Do I see
any scrapings that would give a sign
 Its 
 These markings on the interior
 Something burrowed
 Im going to clean it off a bit
 Im worried about the things around us
 Im going to clear away a little bit
more Is there a body underneath this pile
 Just a hammer
 Ill take a look at the hammer
 I think someone got grabbed
 Ive got a crazy idea
 Well no thats great
Thats way better
 I think that this was some sort
of pathway and maybe this closedoff
pathway here is possibly the way to go
I dont know I feel like we might have
found a way of sneaking into
where were going
 If anyone doesnt mind Im going to
pull out my shovel and start working on this
 This blocked off path that this
got bisected
 Or we could go down this way because I
dont think theres that much dirt in this
 Im going to start prodding to see
how deep this cap on this bottom one goes
 Im going to take a look in there
Do I feel any wind anything
 Its just stagnant air
 A horse on the top of the mountain
 Why would he leave horses
on top of a mountain
 What would you like me
to ask the hammer
 Who was your owner
 The hammer is very obstinate but
I would imagine thats expected of a hammer
Im not going to say it wasnt worth a try
I would have been surprised but
I would have been delighted as well
 Yeah
 Actually thats a good idea Can we
send Frumpkin down one of these tiny tunnels
 Cool
 I can cast Light on the ribbon
too so you dont have to burn a spell
 I cast Light on something
tied to Frumpkin
 Maybe roll back and try
one of these smaller tunnels also
just to see whats a few feet down maybe
 I mean it seems like the thing to do
 What
 Yeah
 Really
 I just wish we knew what these things
were I would have loved to explore some of these
 My thought was we could send the cat up
and down really quick and just take a look
 We have a cat we can just send
down the smaller tunnel really quick
I dont know why we dont just take a peek
 We sent the cat down the big tunnel
 I had a funny feeling
 Id say the downward one
just a quick look not too far down
Top one quick look not too far up
 Id rather them see us now than
 Yeah were going to fan out
 
 Weve got to get both out of them
 Its pretty great
 Lets head to the tunnel
then head to the main room
 Im going to augment that
 They can all hear you
 Thats pretty funny
 I heard that right
 Oh Yeah
 We cant understand them
but we can understand you
 Well I mean we can make some food
I suppose or we can let the cat have his way
Is there any way I can just add a Thaumaturgy
effect to the cat really quickly
 I want the ground around the cat
to shake gently and start having
a minor earthquake effect
 We have food though
 Oh lord
 Well need containers Do you
have a couple of pots Big containers
 Do you have one more I can do two
if youve got two I can do water also
Do you care about water I can do water
 Thats fair
 Im going to take a little piece
of fungus off the stick and Im going to
put it in there and Im going to start
casting Create Food and Water
and its going to suddenly become
 pounds of food
 A little more thunder maybe
 I dont think theyd be interested
Its way too nice for them
I dont think that they really
 Thats so expensive and difficult
to come by in this part of the world
 You dont want I mean we certainly
dont want to give it up
 Well
 Mister Fjord are you sure
 Yeah because there was the two
and then the other two and then the king
and the leader
 I think thats half of the next person
that comes through at that point
 Wow
 Im just making sure nobodys tried to
Ive been trying to keep an eye on things
 Nobodys tried to gank anything right
 That is fair
 Is the cage locked or is it just shut
 Are we going to be walking
within  feet of that cage
 Okay cool
 Once the cage is within  feet Im
just going to pop it open with Thaumaturgy
 Bye buddy
 Its going to be like one of those
YouTube videos where they
let the mouse go in the forest
and just the hawk like ten feet
 It didnt last one day
 What do I hear
 Thats interesting Can your cat
hear what theyre talking about
 No Im going to walk by you and
I dont know if we want to keep an ear out
for what theyre up to
 Cool
 As long as theyre
keeping some distance
 Not yet
 I think at some point Whens
the point where its time to bed down
Are we getting to that point
 I think at some point
were going to bed down
 I think thats a great idea
 And then well go to sleep
 Im just going to I think we should
 Oh am I moving over Okay

 Holy shit
 Im going to make some room here
 Oh my god
 No peeking
 This is chemical warfare man
the scorpion on it is a bag that is buzzing
loudly like its full of hornets
 That I believe is in fact a
 I think thats a natural 

 Yeah that is Thats your old Keyleth
die too Ive never seen it roll one in my life
 Im going to get up
 Aww come on
 I mean I just feel bad really
at this point
 No I feel like we should
hear this out
 Um well
 Mommy
 I like it
centipault out of other oddities that I have on me
 Thats really neat
 Aw man
 Hey hi Hows it going
 Great
 If it gets us to where we need to be
Id be willing to drop another spell
 Another  pounds whatever we dont
need of that  pounds which is an awful lot of food
 Is that a bag of bees youve got
over there
 Oh my god
 Way to bring the whole room down
 Wow
 Yeah this is going to be great
 If theres any way to scoop up
a couple of pieces
 Oh no
 That happened
  Natural 
 Natural 
 I just heard Dani break
in the other room
 The delay is the best
 Oh yeah
 Is it on its way down into the tunnel
How big is this tunnel again
 Lights are dimmed
 Yeah
 I was once a giant there we go
Carry on
 They think there are
more kobolds coming
 In a map Should we mark this
on the map then with a pin
 Oh yeah I like those
 How much can the bubble take
 I can throw my voice if we have to
 I can also make my voice I believe
come from wherever I like within  feet
 Just to have a conversation with these
guys see if theyre willing to make a deal
 I can get across
 If I hit it with Bane beforehand it
would also have a slightly harder time doing that
 I have a sneaking suspicion that
theres probably These giants are fast
faster than we are Probably with some range
 I can briefly go invisible
but not for this whole run
 Mister Caleb is the one to go
 I can be invisible for one run
for one action
 I can get  feet
 Oh I mean Ill be invisible
until Im visible
 Should I be invisible at the beginning
or at the end
 I can be invisible for  feet
 Ill Polymorph then I guess
 Im also going to add resistance to
you so you can add a d to any saving throw
for the next  seconds
 You can add a d to any saving throw
 Oh boy
 This is going to go great
Its a great plan
 Who
 I dont know Man there are so many
options What would be fun I dont know
 I mean dragonflies are pretty cool
 Well I dont know but to be fair
Im not sure if I remember
what Im supposed to do anyway
 Who would be like
 Um actually
 You get the limited edition
from the local store you know
 Its on you
 Im going to hide probably in your
pocket Im going to hide on you as the dragonfly
 Im going to hitch a ride on you
 Shes faster
 You are the Mighty Menagerie
 Thats epic
 My god man
 
 Im also unPolymorphed
over there as well
 Just squeeze Thats all youve got to
 Hi
 Im going to poke my head out
and cast Blindness on the giant
 Yeah
  constitution
 Oh yeah It was a good thought
 Thats all right No it was worth
the thought Ive got a bonus action
I suppose still
 Where have I got my bonus actions
Just for fun lets give him some more bees
 Wake up again guys Im going
to cast the swarm right in his face
 We took a long rest since
the last time I used that
 Its been a while
 I think its been a long rest
 So yeah Thats a swarm of insects
and I think theyre going to attack
 Thats oh god that is terrible
Its eight nine ten  Thats  to hit
 I was going to try to get them
on the face but
 Yeah and Im going to pop back in
all the way as far as I can against the wall
 Oh okay Yeah
 The cow is going to probably
turn back into a giant when they move
 Oh wow Thats a lot of rolling
 I am definitely not  feet away
from that big mo with the
 I would have to get way out
there to be  feet
 I am  feet away from Nott
however correct
 But getting  feet
from Nott is not
 And then hop back in
 All right Im going to
hop out and
 Oh thats right I dont know
where Nott is do I
 Then I would have just
 Im going to be
on the nope train
 Yeah In fact if anything
 Yeah Im going to hold
a healing spell for
 Oh just Cure Wounds
Just the bonus action one
 You get to keep
moving though right
 Man you had to regrow a leg
 Its going to be fine
 Monster I got a plan
 I got a plan Everythings
going to be fine
 I got a plan
 Yeah
 No
 Heres the thing though
 I am holding
a healing spell for the second I see him
 No Healing Word Im so sorry
 I meant the  foot because
I was trying for the  foot range I am so sorry
I said the wrong thing because I was not running
out there I was going for the  foot range
 So the second I see
 The second Nott is visible I cast
Cure Wounds I cast Healing Word Im so sorry
 I dont have to roll it
 You are  points up
 This is not a bad idea
 I mean you could grab Caleb
I dont know
 Im holding Stone Shape
 The second Caleb is through the hole
the stone is sealing The entire door is gone
Its just rock again
 Dude Come here
 That was such a surprise
