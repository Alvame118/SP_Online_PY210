 Somebody has a gambling problem

thought
 I dont have a problem with goblins but
you guys arent in any trouble are you No ones

 Good to know
 Annabelle

 The birds are out already
 Theres no benches Oh fuck
 Carnival I dont know

 Yasha Were going to need those weapons

 Not part of the show

 Ripping the falchion can I swing it into
the creature
 I do Thank god because that was a one

 Nice
 
 Take a shot
 This things swinging hard Holy shit

bonus action to cast Hex on it
 I would like to use my falchion to open it
the fuck up
 
 Thats  points of damage plus five
points of necrotic damage
 Is it made of piano wire

 In this moment
 First one
 Yasha have you ever seen anything like
this happen before
 What are the corpses doing now that
theyve fallen
 Put your hands down
 Youre not even ready
 You should know that whatever happened to
that first man when he attacked the woman she
caught whatever he had
 They dont have watches yet
 We did
 Bo

 You pointed at me
 The Nestled Nook Inn
 I have an intelligence of  I know what
Im doing
 Holy shit
 Yeah totally new dice
 What are you talking about
 Im a ballerina
 Yeah well all be in one place
 Good to know
 Are there three regular crownsguard that
are going with Molly Or is the Watchmaster going
with them as well
 Ill go out the front exit of the tent
just to see if the Watchmaster goes with Molly
 Bipedal or on all fours
 Youre good youre good youre good
 That is a bastard die right there
 Thats a tease
 Time to go to jail
 Tried to do the Sherlock Holmes
 She sees you having a seizure in the
chains

 Thats correct
 I can assure you were here to cause no
trouble We will be as compliant as we possibly
can be
 Would you call it infectious
 Excuse me
 Oh I thought you were right behind us
 Mollymauk I dont mean to pry into your
business but has this ever happened to you
before
 Oh I dont know about that
 Right the large toad that was with the
girl whats the story there
 Unfortunately no
 Well yeah
 Dont Leave
 It was a busy day for us Unfortunately
were partially responsible for this one as well
Bad luck
 Fair enough
 To the side I say to Jester I say
 This
does not really fall in with keeping a low
profile We talked about this
 Yeah it is
 Are they not going to take her to see the
Lawmaker
 Actually we were just upstairs and it
would really help us if we could perhaps
expedite the process Perhaps theres an
arrangement we could come to if she could see the
Lawmaster now
 An audience is all were asking for No
favors
 God bless 
 I understand Thank you for your
understanding
 Beau remember your little sister
 I do hate to trouble you again twice in
the same evening Its incredibly inconvenient
 If we may this sweet girl here was also
part of our party and she is quite the protective
one Im afraid that she was also providing aid to
our fellows in that tent Im afraid her younger
sister was attacked in a similar way I feel its
only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to
protect this young dwarven girl that performed in
the circus She means no harm
 Oh yeah baby  Natural 
 Im new at this stat Dont fuck it up
 Indeed And we can be found at any hour
The Nestled Nook Inn is where we are
 A great idea indeed And thankfully there
was no fleshtoflesh contact
 Indeed It would give us no greater
pleasure than to get out of your hair
 Understood
 Indeed we would This is most gracious of
you Lawmaster Norda
 What No I was trying to say she had a
little sister that had a similar incident and that
made you try to protect Toya I was trying to
throw you a bone
 Were under watch
 Yeah You did all right
 Did you see anything
 We dont know that
 Have you been to this town before
 And youve never seen conditions like this
affect any other carnival goer before
 Where are the other two
 The stinky one and the little one
 Yeah Can we look around and see if we
spot Caleb and
 I wonder if they came back
 They are
 Good
 What did you come to Trostenwald for
 Sure Im not trying to pry I was just
curious where you were going
 I like funny stories
 You did some crazy shit with that sword of
yours
 You polish off that one already
 Can we get another round For the
 Wise words
 Only because we seem to find ourselves in
quite the predicament
 No Id love to
 Its a moving story
 Would it be fair to say that the more
someone desires something the more youre
interest increases
 Are you good at it Do you get caught very
often
 Now Jester if I may we are already in a
little bit of a pickle
 I take one step back
on the sacred money pot of school 
If you place a copper piece into this pot
and say the magic words 
whats the magic word again
 By the end of the week you made your money
back
 Some people more than others
 Well I mean I was really impressed with
the little trick I sure would like to see a big
trick
 Jester I meant a trick from Caleb
 I would love one
 How did you learn to do that
 Thats impressive
 Is it something that can be taught to
others
 Well Im just a little curious about
how people use their magic
 No its relatively new for me though so
Im just trying to learn
 No I wonder if maybe I should be
 No Again fairly recently
 Yeah
 Yeah were not super deep
 Well I came up from the town of Port
Damali
 Yeah I met Jester a while back and after I
Ieft town coming up to the northeast I ran
across her Id seen her do some of her magic
before Thats what Im trying to learn about
 Thats true
 Molly if you would like to share my room
you can
 DD Beyonds watching going Fuck you
Nott
 Molly thats your tab right
 Yeah except for that one
 Thats true
 Are you praying over your swords
 Is that part of your thing
 I try to be
 Thats quite the story Can I insight
check him
 
 Well thank you for sharing that
honest story with me It means a lot
 Ey oh ey yourself

 Yeah we said we were going to do that
didnt we What did you have in mind
 Thats a detailed plan
 I like it Are we taking anybody with us
 Fair enough Do you want to ask any of
them
 Yeah thats not going to cut it not quite
like what we had in mind
 Shes right here
 Lets see if Caleb and his little friend
are downstairs first He has tricks after all
 Yall are downstairs
 Its like a little dog The little back
foot creeps up  If we could were did
you just fucking Shit We were thinking of maybe
finding our way outside of the inn for a bit I
dont want to presume anything but do you have
the ability to change the way you look
 Yeah You know
 Yeah assume a different form
 Right
 Molly what about you
 Fair enough
 Beau I dont want to leave you behind
but I
 He makes a point I think that the sooner
we find the cause of this the sooner we can get
out of here
 Lets get out of here Can I walk back
into a privy washroom area
 Can I use my Mask of Many Faces to cast
Disguise Self on myself
 Older whitehaired with a beard Just
very simple peasants clothes Maybe a bit of a
farmer or a land worker
 Smudges dirt on the fingernails
 In twos or singles
 Level two trying to get out of a fucking
inn
  New York is where Id
rather stay

 Should I go first
 Not command ops in the tavern hall
 You want to come with
 Dont do anything stupid Mouth shut eyes
forward Show me how you walk Maybe a little
less Thats nice I also assume a little limp
slight
 
 Just keep moving to the other side of the
street
 What color is that die
 Lets just keep walking for now
 Thats a good point
 Maybe there is a morgue maybe they
recognized him
 Was he in good health
 I should point out this is the second
connection to the Ustaloch
 Well before we met up with you two we
fought off a wicked sick water snake
 
 Did he work for any of the particular
breweries around
 If we were to go down to the docks and ask
after a few people he worked with is there anyone
you know that we should speak to familiar of
his
 I understand that
 Thank you for the drink Vosna Ill be
taking my leave now
 We got to get Molly
 We head outside Well that was
revealing
 Youre worried about them having a heart
attack or something
 She makes a valid point actually
LAURA Oh If people are scared of carnivals they
wont want them in the future
 Bingo
 That might be harder to do Maybe we go
down to the Lochward
 How far is it from where we are to the
Lochward
 Lets head down to the docks Keeping an
eye out for crownsguard
 Do we see any Kings Guard Crownsguard
  same
 No
 Flattery got you nowhere
 Damn it
 Fuck it I drop Disguise Self
 Im sorry to deceive you
 Rinaldo this snake that was in your house
is not the only strange occurrence thats been
happening Were trying to find out the cause of
it Have you seen anything else like this in the
time thats passed
 Were asking after a man that helped down
at the docks named Enon Have you heard of him
 Enon
 We were trying to see if he might have
worked with people that might have known what he
was doing that day earlier
 I see youre skinning the beast Can I ask
why
 If we went down to the docks where he
worked is there anyone that we should ask for to
speak to who might have known him better
 I do
 If you think of anything or if you hear
anyone speak about him you can find us at the
Nestled Nook Inn Wed appreciate anything if it
happens to reach your ears
 Much obliged
 Shall we
 We should probably wrap up whatever were
doing I imagine theyre going to come by the inn
soon and try and speak with us Not you two
 Nope No stuffed beds no recordings on
the old VHS
 Im a little concerned that weve been
gone for a while
 Maybe let these two that arent under
house arrest
 No continue I mean if youre up for
it
 Tavernkeeper doesnt know anything about
this
 Well see you back at the inn
 I can keep them busy at the front door
 Childhood cat destroyed
 Faced with our own mortality
 Must be plugged in and connected to Wifi
 Indiana Jones style
 Yes
 Jury summon
 I open it
 I shut the door
 Go take that game in the other room why
dont you
 Thank you
 Sure
 You found nothing at the docks zip
zero
 How late
 I can be down for that
 Where were you when you saw these cloaked
figures
 At 
AM
 We could
 Should someone stay up Well I was
thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof
of the inn in case someone comes for us while
everyone else is out
 I dont know Can you conjure those golden
orbs up into the air as like a signal
 Maybe we just risk it
 Its 
AM Im sure everybody will be
asleep Lets risk it
 Didnt really look like much
 Yeah
 I ought to be leading the way I reckon
 
 Good idea
 Nine
 Look up Yeah
 Let me get it
 We have a few more hours and the cover of
darkness
 Whos real stealthy
 Maybe we dont all need to go Maybe
just a few and the others will hang back
 An hour and a half
 Is it like a mound of poop or like a
single
 Is it a worm Its a snake
 Yeah I thought it was like chocolate
frozen yogurt
 Stealthily to the circus
 Yeah going in danger close
 Nine
 I cast Disguise Self and I turn myself
into a crownsguard
  Indeed stay our blade
please obviously he can handle this
 Right in your face Haha incredible
 Is that a natural thing for you guys to
just attack each other in moments of stress
 Oh I cant tell if that got worse or
better
 If you want to make your ways around I
could distract them for a moment have a
conversation with them
 For an hour
 Sure I got it yeah
 Caleb and me
 I walk up to the guard  Its
a late night not much action this evening See
anything unusual
 Yeah have you heard heard 
How long are they supposed to be here
 At least youre by the tent theyve had
us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire
time
 Did they find anything inside today Tell
me something interesting please
 Would you mind if we popped in
 Where is it Jesus
Oh 
 Well be quick super fast
 Lets go
 That worked way better
than I thought Like we should I mean
 should we look around for stuff or what

 Well you know I do a little mimicry here
and there We should look come on Check the
grounds Maybe we can find where the bodies are
laying
 Well lets search the grounds
 Have they moved the bodies or are the
bodies still there
 Can we check the bodies for anything
 Thats better
 
 Okay Roll high I did not Ten
 We cant spend that long in here Maybe we
just take a bit of it with us Do you have a
pocket
 Like a jar II got no pockets
 Theres no pockets All right but Ill
check
 Agreed
 You ever cast this before
 Reversal
 Little feet
 Eats and shoots the same way 
 It opens it closes you can see your
spells when you need to see them without
flipping
 Why are you going all catatonic on me
 Can you talk to me when youre looking
through the cat
 But were not supposed to be there Were
gonna get framed for it
 That is true
 When that demon frog leapt how high and
how far approximately did it look like it went
 Sure we can
 Oh god
 Oh man this is good dude
 Its also done without any contact
 Its done without any contact He never
touches him
 Good shit Little damaged voice fuck

 Totally good
 Oh right off the bat
 We rolled low Level two

your dice tray If this was Tony Hawk you would
be accumulating points still its racking it up
 Oh yeah can I fucking run up past the
cart Charge into the fray with my  speed
 Can I pull out my falchion Ill flip it
over so its pommel up and I will use Eldritch
Blast towards the remaining zombie
 That is a 
 Im telling you its all happening you

 I look around and say we need to drop this

Come back to bite you in the anus
 Come on baby

 You didnt fall into the fire right
 Are you sure
 Because of your magical technicolor
dreamcoat
 So brave
 Nice
Molly Well next up as this is now
important Jester its your turn
 She has desserts
 No vanilla extract or sprinkles
 We still look like Crownsguard
 Caleb and I
 Did anybody see what happened or where
that hellish toad went
 You saw it
 We cant be here
 What Where
 I dont want to get these folk in any more
trouble How far is it from here to the lake
 I say we could drag them and throw them
into the lake to avoid suspicion on the carnival
Weve got to get out of here
 Wheres Caleb
 He was I look around for Caleb
 Thats a devastating toot
 Nott have you seen Caleb
 You got his little cat right there on your
shoulder
 We need to get out of here We need to
follow after that toad
 Thats actually not a terrible idea
 Thats a great idea Lets do that
 Who wants to help me with the one totally
charred body
 Shit Never would have known
 Ill help you
 I mean its either that or leave the
carnival and take the fall for what is two dead
crownsguard
 Whered you go
 You shot shit out of your hands I dont
think you were not brave That was really
impressive
 It was fire Its a figure of fucking
speech
 Yeah okay We go back over there and we
fucking grab Molly I grab him by his horns
 Is that single horse a mustang
 What Can I ask a simple question
 Its not a mare Im just checking
 Im just very curious as to the sex of the horse
thats all
  No 
 Yeah
 Youll find out

 You couldnt see us in the low light but
they chased after whatever caused this
 Any previous episodes of this kind
 Well try and find some evidence that will
exonerate you and well return
 We should really get to stepping
 Sure
 I do Shelby
 Just deliver it to the PO Box thats
fine
 In the direction the toad leapt
 We might need to play it by ear
 If its too dangerous well stand down
How about that
 Yeah you blanked out there for a second
 Yeah
 This is the best we can do for them
 Lamplight on the boat
 Were going to have to ditch this wagon
anyway because weve got tracks
 Vanity plate What does it say
 No they dont have to go in the water
right Theyre burned Its not like they burned
in the water
 It would
 Thats what I just said
 I wish I had something that could
help Molly out
 As weve been riding have we seen any
tracks that we think might have belonged to the
toad Since it was leaping in these huge arcs
 Ugh three
 Why We could get rid of the wagon later
 Once the sun comes up
 No no we cant just leave
 Lets see if we can find the toad If the
sun starts to break then well make up our mind
 Yes kick them out
 Anybody else want to look for some toad
prints
 Weve been doing that already
 Thats actually a great idea
 Come on dont roll Sams fucking dice
 In the shape that its in this print Are
their toes pointing in a specific direction
 
 Two
 One and a giant toad
 Girl
 Does one look like Gorilla Grodd and
 
 Were not lucky enough to have any small
boats along the shores that have been beached
 Yeah we got like four hours until
sunrise
 How do we feel about the knowledge that
its somewhere here in the lake perhaps or the
other side Circling back tomorrow At least well
avoid suspicion if were at the inn
 Im sure we can find some charcoal
 And you two seem to be able to move freely
without suspicion
 And leave it outside town as were
making our way back
Maybe give the horse a little spank 
on the ass and send it on its way
 Shall we
 We head back
 I thought we were going to head back 
to the village to a good distance
 Were taking the cart back to a distance
from the city
 Yeah and then letting the horses run
so the sending the track off
 Please roll bad If there is any 
justice in the world
 Horses are our new door
 Im going to use Mask of Many Faces to
make myself look old
  but Im also
 We made it
 No knock on our door only you two
 Your jury summons is 
 Ill open the door
 Yes
 I just shut the door
 And dies
 No hands in your pockets order
 And its about 
 to 

 In the next couple hours they said they
would call for us
 I was going to say did they come to your
room as well
 I mean we tell the truth we did nothing
wrong
 I was thinking that if we get out of there
tonight fingers crossed we should probably think
about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the
lake tonight
 Or I may be able to arrange free passage
on a vessel
 I have a little knack with you know
 Well for a bit
 Few years
 Sure am Yep
 I have It gets funnier every time though
I got to say Its all in the delivery
 Is it too early in the campaign to walk
away And I fucking saunter away
 And we didnt see anybody it fed on
 How well did you know Kylre
 Yeah what did he feast on
 I think we saw both the fast and the
slow feeding methods
 Yeah weaknesses Vulnerabilities
 In the bathroom
 Well our day just got freed up
 Are you sure you want to do this with
your cat
 Anything else besides a bird I mean any
kind of creature
 It can be killed is an important thing to
know I only mean if its important to you
in a moment of danger I would try to save it but
if thats not important
 Fair enough Thats very impressive
 I have ten gold
 Well if youd like you could stay at the
inn or we could acquire that boat and once youre
on board we could send it out as a sort of a
recon
 It is daytime right now it would require
us leaving now
 A what
 We should take advantage of the daytime
Out the windows as we did before
 Perhaps we should go upstairs
 If thats the case well get the boat If
not well let drone sparrow activate
 We could try to go out the side of the
windows It is daytime
 Can we say were doing this from one of
our rooms
 Yep theres that bullshit again
 He talks He will talk to you out of the
fucking blue
 You kill us all
 That is a hell of a talent you have
 Can we ask what you saw
 Was it busy water was there lots of
ships out
 Its not a lull for any reason
 Fair enough Out the window shall we
 Is anyone else going to be heading out the
front door besides Caleb Nott and myself
 I think thats smart
 Thats great yeah
 He has tentacles now
 Can I use Mask of Many Faces to change
into that older grayhaired farmer
 Using DD Beyond

 I can do that Do you want to come along
on this little escapade
 Fair enough So Ill head out the front
 Can I locate the crownsguard
 Can I run up to him and say
 old raspy
voice You please over here Ive seen one of
those creatures Its tearing into him and its
horrible Please come quickly
 
 This way quickly please
 Its a nordic 
 Weekend at Bernies walking Looking
around at nothing
 I look over my shoulder and keep running
Why are you following me
 Have I done something again Have you seen
my son Whats your name Youre a strong looking
 Oh dear Do you have any coin
 Im sorry No respect for the elderly
apparently I walk away
  I make my way towards the
docks
 I think we may be able to avoid any kind
of trading of currency
 Let me see if I can find a boat that would
accommodate all of us and see if we can find some
amicable people
 As a sailor apparently Im able to
acquire free passage on ships
 I have to talk the talk and
maybe trade something but
 Hello there I was hoping that perhaps I
could trouble you Were trying to make our way
out into the lake some of my companions and I
for a small day trip Weve never quite been out
on the lake not this one Is there a chance we
could trade some work on your days journey for
some travel
 Im sorry were a bit light on coin Is
there perhaps anything we could help you with
around here in trade
 Indeed Many years of my life
 Port Damali
 They never go away
 Yes it would help me look a bit more
impressive in the eyes of my younger comrades
 Much obliged
 I go back It fucking worked

 After all we came to him right I would
prefer not to use any violence
 Youre right Coin is a good idea
 Oh shit Wait a minute How long did that
fight take
 Oh cool Okay There was an old man who
was with us before
 Maybe we give him the extra bottle of wine
and you go talk to him
 I could stand guard as a crownsguard next
to it
 Agreed The less attention the better
 The less attention the better
 Norda
 I like it As soon as other crownsguard
arrive with Norda and the rest of whoever you
bring to the scene maybe I can go with you and
help return Toya
 I think Beau makes a very good point
Without Toyas testimony were in trouble
 Unfortunately the authorities think that
Gustav and the circus are responsible for what
happened Actually its just Kylre He wasnt
what you thought he was Im afraid
 Its Sam good
 It might do for you to apologize
 Okay Im going to hop off the boat and
break eye contact with the captain of the boat so
that I can Disguise Self into a crownsguard
  Who goes there What is
this what have you brought
 Are you responsible for this
 Its a horrifyinglooking creature You
are to be commended for your bravery Lawmaster
Norda will want to know about this immediately
  No 
 All right we cant waste any time
 Tongue and mouth just 
 Molly do you intend to keep Toya here or
do you need to take her back
 Im keeping watch over the toad head
 Its fucking me right We know its still
me Im right here
 No
 You can do what you want
 Sure Ill make a dramatic flourish of
it
 Take it with you scratch that Good
idea
 All right go quickly
 What what
 You turned into Mr Rogers
 How far away are they from me Too far
 You can roll one hit die Hes rolling
commando He dont want it
 You rolled a zero
 Whats your modifier negative two
 Brave new world
 You will
 I draw back and flames burst forth
 If I can clock that I would like to leave
the head move off into the shadows and assume my
older man form
 No I can just drop
 Ill drop the crownsguard and make the
old man and sit so I can keep an eye on it but
away from it
 I would like to try once they start
making their way back to that facility to quickly
make my way to the inn if I can as the old man
enter make my way into the restroom drop my
disguise come back out as Fjord Oh the water
closet what have you
 Yeah the room with the pot in it Then
make my way back to the front door stick my head
out where the guards are
 Please I cant seem to find any of my
comrades Have you seen where they have gone
 I was afraid as much Could I make my way
down to where they are being held I would like to
be present if it would be prudent
 Very kind of you
 Showing up just to get arrested
 Baby oil
 I just turn to the nearest crownsguard
and
 Molly what do you think this means for
the carnival
 Its not that nice
 Its very late right
 Dont suppose you want to retire for the
evening Share a drink together now that this is
somewhat behind us
 Im sorry Yasha for new patrons youre
going to have to surrender your sword
 I could couldnt I
 Looks could be deceiving
 I just thought it would be a nice
gesture
 No to give up her sword
 Oh Im a paying patron here They know me
quite well
 Did you want to stay in that room any
longer Molly
 Lets get a drink
 No
 We had quite the adventure actually I
know people were hurt but that was really
something
 Closed it down
 What would you do with a really large
tent
 Yeah we were still planning on moving on
after this
 Well I wanted to find out more about the
Soltrice Academy yes I didnt know what
direction you were heading I never even asked
what you were doing here in the first place
 A walking tour
 Are you on a vacation
 Bring a lot of money with you for that
vacation did you
 I dont believe youre on vacation Where
are you going
 She goes unconscious

 Ill keep that in mind
 Up north Northeast to the Solstryce
Academy
 Were kind of going from town to town and
asking as we go Afraid we dont know too much
 Theres safety in numbers you know
 Broke out of prison Thats very
impressive
 In the short time weve spent with you
you seem to be very upstanding folks Im sure it
wasnt for anything too serious
 Yeah is there anywhere we should stay
away from on our travels
 Who said that
 Yasha anywhere that we should avoid for
you
 Being confined
 Damn right

 That seems fair
 If you werent too anxious to run off
anywhere
 Right Any sightseeing we should schedule
along our way
 Zadash
 Keep that in mind

 You all right with this
 Do you
 Damn that shit glows
 Dont die
 Are you alive
 How does she look
 Oh fuck Did you get horse kicked
 Damn Hows the horse look
 Thats a bit excessive
 I dont know if that bones supposed to be
sticking out of that part
 I bet Yasha can pop it back into place
 You just made a bow
 Not you her What happened to her
 With the guy you
 This woman was she with the fellow that
you left with last night
 Cobalt Reserve He was in the court
 
 Apparently eating less of my bacon
motherfucker
 Warm doo Thank you
 You just shit all over her
 Dont put your hands in your pockets
 Please be Laura when she was five and

 Further north I appreciate your time
thank you
 Shes right fucking there
 Shall we depart
 Gotta go
 Thats it for me
 Its going to smell like Sephoria I
know it
 Thats the fancy version
 Instant headache
 How about a few experiences
 I know a unique substance when I see it
Ill take one as well
 Ill tell you what because you are such a
purveyor of such interesting items I will take
one of those health potions but for  gold
Thats the running price Ive seen in neighboring
towns and I dont mean to be swindled
 
 The decision was still happening by the
time you got to the last letter
 That is an overexaggeration
 Health potions were quoted at  but he
was kind enough to understand that  was enough
 Gold pieces
 Its cool now
 Ill take it
 Yeah like a wagon
 I like it
 Yeah free to go at any time As long as
it serves everyone well stay this way
 Do we have our fucking wagon ready
 I think we should be able to yeah I
mean a little guidance goes a long way You seem
to be good at looking out for Nott
 I do You can trust us Youre safe here
Im concerned with what happens with Jester and
Beau I think amongst all of us we should be
fine
 Well make it work
 That is mighty considerate of you Nott
Are you sure you dont want to take a crack at it
 Use your diaphragm Really get a yeehaw
get in there
 One more time on the count of three One
two three On three I push his chest in
 Well we committed felonies and mail
fraud Thats good
 We bought a little bit of mold
 Yeah we got to go back and not watch that
later
 Oh god we got to shop We got to book
shop
 Is Beau is her face all jibbityjacked
or is it pretty normallooking at this point
 Not that I watched anything from last week
because I didnt 
 I bet she doesnt want to talk about that
Thats a good shiner
 Did you give as good as you got
 Its got the greenyellow sunset
happening things are starting to spread Tomorrow
will be
 That trouble going to follow you as we go
on our way or do you think youre free and clear
 Nice
 How old are those donuts
 Any lint from the bag that they were being
held in
 You juggling those big motherfucking
swords
 Is there money involved
 Right Im sorry
 Oh my god
 We should what
 
 I would just like to suggest we might give
way There are six of them
 Were going to kill it
 But were not walking

 Molly feel like making some coin doing a
little bit of a show
 Would you normally you know hijack a
caravan like that
 Just going off what you said earlier I
dont want to change your behavior just because
youre with us all of a sudden
 I am not Merely asking a question
 Wait what does that
 If were pointing them down reach for the
sky
 Only because I have no experience in it I
was just curious what it was that you might have
done you know previously
 Fair enough
 I might take you up on that yeah
  Beau
 Oh sorry
 So generous of you
 Yeah Smash
 Plus weve been traveling for what About
hour and a half two hours now
 We should probably rest the horse for
just a bit

 Ill stay with you
 Or falling out of it which we would
really enjoy
 We were shitting in the bushes
 Its impossible to believe him
 Should we pull off on the side of the road
and get a campfire going
 Shall we collect some wood and start a
fire
 Anybody want to come with me to find some
kindling
 Shall we
 All right Go look for some deadish
branches
 Nobody Were all going to sleep
 Bipedal
 Oh shit what
 Yeah there you go
 Hey what the fuck did you wake us up for
anyway
 Thats a joke
 Yeah Where are they
 Lets go look at one
 Fuck yeah Take me cowtipping son Woo
 I dont know Back in college
 Yeah lets go look at one
 Shit
 Id like to with my darkvision
 
 Well that was worth a look
 Its vaguely what I imagine a buffalo
would look like
 Back to sleep
 For me
 Why  Why didnt you roll a
higher perception
 Oh god Oh no
 Oh shit
  What are you
 Watching me
 My potential What are you asking of me
 Learn What would you have me learn
 Learn grow provoke consume I dont
understand
 A reward for this Im listening
 Fuck Fuck you What were those words
 Sorry I found a patch of strawberries
 Yeah Were fine Were great Just
doing dandy Yep
 Of course
 Sometimes it doesnt take that long you
know what I mean
 
 Yeah No Im fine
 Like a momma bird Everybody have some of
what I puked up Its all good
 Yeah I dont think it was acid reflux
 I dont know I want to shake your hand
but at the same time I want to smash it
 I had a dream Im sorry A vivid one
Just shook me to my core a little Ill be fine
really Its not a common thing
 I dont know
 Yeah That sword is a pickle
 Its a mystery
 Yeah I feel funny Caleb you remember me
asking you about your arcane prowess
 My small experience with the arcane came
to me around the same time that sword did
 Not too long ago Very recent Right
before I met up with Jester
 Yeah I was Did a lot of merchant
sailing previously Had one trip that didnt go
so well Suffice it to say after it was done I
found that sword
 Yeah
 Yeah Im not real comfortable talking
about it
 I found it on the shore When I got back
to land it was just there Im not super familiar
with a ton of weaponry the sword I know I had
some training in it but this seemed like a unique
sword I felt like it almost called to me I know
how that sounds but when I picked it up seemed
like everything changed Ever since Ive been
able to do more things Been able to reach out
with some of the stuff Ive seen you do Thats
why Im trying to make it up to the Academy Im
trying to figure out what it is that I have
 I dont mean to alarm any of you really
Im trying to be as forthright as I can
 Can I make it appear
 I focus Reach down
 You can see why Im a little curious about
this item
 Do you have any experience with items like
this
 Could we revisit that idea perhaps Im
sorry the night has left me a bit shaken and I
feel like I need a moment to get my bearings if
thats all right
 Of course not and I dont want to make anyone
feel uneasy Again trying to be as transparent as
I can I dont quite understand and I appreciate
your patience in advance And I make it vanish
  No I hadnt considered that
terrifying thought but thanks Ill just add that
to the fucking list
 In a jar
 Tell you what I start sweating real hard
Ill let you know okay
 I dont really remember
 I dont really remember my dreams all that
well They leave me quickly
 If you wouldnt mind

 Okay good Im going to have him climb up
on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll

 Thats fair Can I use my bonus action to
use my Mask of Many Faces to make myself look like
a gnoll No theyre taller Theyre too tall
 Two feet taller I can only do a foot

 Id like to do it
 I was hoping to just be Because I cant
see that far to be right here to hit the only
guy that could see me on the ground there

 That is it
 I should have used it on that fucker
  Hey come on lets go

 But Im a gnoll Ah
 Im just confused that hits
 Understood
 Yeah great awesome sweet Can I use
Eldritch Blast against the big fucking guy
because he didnt get any closer for a melee
attack right
 Oh Imma fucking move out of his attack

move back towards the corner where I was going
 No all the way back Back towards my
original hiding place
 That hits
 I will now out of his melee range

acceptable option right now
 Yeah its simple numbers Them leaving is

 Hideous indeed
 My turn

 Ill go ahead and use my  speed to close in on
the pronedout Great and Ill use Eldritch Blast
against that
 
 Thats it Thats my turn
 We need the assistance of guards guys
 Its hard
 What you really want to do something
 Really
 Whats your spider sense
 Thatll be all the damage
 Your friend took off running
 Ill run forward using my  feet but
 Let them go
 What were those creatures Have you
encountered them before
 Such a grizzly scene they seemed to be
carrying away bodies on that cart they had
 I did
 Indeed My concern is that theyll return
Weve fended them off for now but theyll come back
 Are you going to run back to the group or
bring WC with
 Oh cool okay
 Indeed we could provide some extra
muscle perhaps for some lodging while we stay and
maybe we could aid your men and their efforts to
exterminate this foe
 Nein
 Crute
 We appreciate that Hopefully there wont
be another call to action while theyre here but
you can count on us if there is
 Damn
 Im great with a bed
 Jester
 That bed was not my favorite
 Little stiff
 You use a pillow or are you just on the
floor
 Do you have to pray over your swords or
anything this morning
 Yeah well we were sharing a room one
night and Molly has a ritual I think its part
of his custom Yeah he performs over his swords
 No Stop it
 Yeah I mean for fear of your life you
ran
 I understand that sentiment Trying to
find a little respite a little peace
 Youre in control of it Youre using it
for yourself
 Im tempted
 
 Nah
 I seem to have missed my calling
 I know what youre asking I didnt have
any other dreams It was fairly restful
 None I care to speak of
 Anything left
 We couldnt quite see it at night thats
true Maybe we should go down
 He said he was going to bring the rest I
think later
 Hey Molly didnt you say Bryce said it
would come later
 Jester we agreed not to put anyone in
harms way in an excessive manner
 Did we not
 Maybe I thought that was an unspoken
thing
 I think Im fine
 Fair enough
 Actually I think theyll find us
 We go downstairs
 Arating for the city of Los Angeles
 You just give us all diabetes thats
great
 Coconut shrimp
 Did you just outtalk Jester
 Yeah
 No I knew where you were going with it
though How do we ring the dinner bells is what
youre saying How do we get them to come to us
 Well they done took it all I think
 Why more so now
 Well they took all the Lubys Cafeteria
with them so I dont think theyre going to be
hungry for a bit
 Then we would need to roast some meats
 Who
 Yeah He was hungry all of a sudden
 You thinking some of them gnolls had
some fiendish qualities perhaps
 Right shit
 I forgot all about that
 I have some weird dreams What did you have
in mind Other nights

 Oh nothing I got shit in my teeth
 Yeah fine Did you have a plan Did you
want to do something to wrangle them
 Oh sorry Well maybe well follow them
to the Barn Broad
 Broad Barn I was fucking with you
 Yeah thats all right
 Seems some people handle pressure better
than others He doesnt seem like the handling type
 We couldnt help but overhear that you
were asking for some aid How long were you
thinking you might need these replacements
 Well I think I speak for all of us were
certainly up to the task for a bit Well maybe
for a little less than a bit Can I ask are there
any other threats to this town besides those gnolls
 Things that come on legs and with weapons
I mean
 Why do both of you know that
 Do you know what area they might have gone
to
 More of a pamphlet actually
 Advance
 Hey Caleb
 Was that a characterDM inside joke
 Caleb
 In my personal holdings I dont really
remember putting this there but apparently I
have five sticks of incense that I have no
intention of using
 Will that do you any good
 I think it was part of a thing I dont
know
 Its DD Beyond I dont know
 I think so yes
 Changed your day didnt it Everythings
coming up flowers now
 Dont mention it
 As he walks away Im like
 Ow

 Only you would put poop in a jar Jester
 Yeah Insecticide Pesticide Herbicide
 Yeah but you ever chugged a bunch of
insecticide Thats a bad day
 Its like Visine
 Just the juice
 It is With a little whiskey
 Like cheeseburger in a shot glass
 What do you need to do for the rest of the
day Caleb
 I think if we were a little spread it
would help
 Well I would follow the direction they
left last night See if we can find a trail
 Yeah you just stay behind Caleb Youll
be fine
 Yeah
 You know I love that idea Small thing
though Time again is of the essence
 Right Dry aged Really get a good hickory
chip under them Problem is people might be dying
in the meantime So if we could find a more
expedient solution
 Beau had an idea Get them Beau You tell
her
 Beau had a fantastic observation If we
happen to see one of those beasts of burden on
our way out tracking maybe we could wrangle one
up and use it as a bait
 To bring people back
 I think youre right Extra horse We need
the cart
 I think wed be making a best guess at this
point My best hope is to find out where they are
What it looks like where theyre staying and if
we can without confrontation get some survivors
out of there That would be ideal
 Im just putting it out there
 maybe
survivors before ears
 I thought you said you werent a
tactician look at you
 Calebs plan Lets do it
 Cman I thought I was the seaman Fucking
get your titles right Come on brother you know
you want to Im a proud son of a bitch
 Do we see any crownsguard around In the
street
 Id just like to find one if I could
 Howdy
 Sorry to bother but weve been
commissioned by Bryce to make a little expedition
to go after those gnolls and were going to need
an extra steed if the Crownsguard has one
 Where would those be
 Are you concerned about the people that
live in this town Clocks ticking on their lives
and you want me to go get a steed from another
stable instead of saving their lives
 I sure would hate to have to report this
to Bryce I think theyd be pretty upset about it
 
 Your name
 Reggie Im disappointed Reggie I dont
know what else to say Lets go

 Fuck yeah Now
 Very nice
 We make our way over to where we left our
other horse and cart
 I dont know why I thought you were going
to say they left behind poop
 If thats the direction you saw them head
off in check it out
 Yeah that is bad news Are the carts all
heading in the same direction or would they split up
 Tall grass on these rolling hills
 Picked by beasts or
 The grass is it dead or vibrant
green
 Is it still the morning hour or about
midday
 High noon
 Oh no Dont do it Oh no

 It was right there
 Mmhmm
 Right
 King of the world
 Yes By foot is how we should proceed
 No
 Would you want to be the one person that
got attacked with the horses by yourself
 Yeah I didnt think so We stick
together
 Yep Now Im ready to die

 That would give away our stealthy
approach
 Holy shit
 No rocks around right No stones or
boulders in the field
 I was trying to get it in the depression
of a rolling hill and just
 We havent seen anything yet
 Kill the horses Oh to use as thats
right we could
 Lets find out what we see first and then
well decide
 Everybody fan out in a firing line just
one straight line
 Just within eye distance right But keep
a line
 Keep in line Were going to move towards
the cart Were going to use the tall grass
 Yeah
 Im open to it if you have any
 Yeah lets do that
 Peoples lives Urgency Clock Time All
that stuff
 Were all even moving forward
 I dont mind being on an end How about
that
 You want to be in the middle
 
 Can we see how many entrances there are to
this mine yard
 I could make a distraction Nott Beau
are yall fast quick and quiet
 Who else
 Theres three of them right
 All right
 About how far from the edge of the grass
where we are to them
 Can I use Minor Illusion to create a plump
little bunny and have it hop out of the grass But
its front leg looks a little lame
 Now
 I did
 Would you like to go
 I dont want to like make yall alarmed
or anything but that was kind of fucking efficient
 Hands are sweaty
 Youre right
 Quick perimeter check to see if we alerted
anything anythings looking at us
 Natural 
 Move to the cart quick check of anything
left behind clues
 Theres no bodies just blood spatter
 Oh Weve got to figure out where were
going first
 Do it
 Youre a lot stronger than you look
 Yeah boy sure did
 Youre anxious to go You want to go
first
 Frumpkin is still just a sweet little
bird so I thought maybe a little quick flight in
 Oh Oh smash
 Canary in a gnoll mine
 I dont know if thats something Frumpkin
can do unless Nott you just wanna go in there
and go kamikaze
 Oh shit Oh shit Oh yes
 We get her hammered and shes the most
fucking badass
 Oh no
 My only concern is if we draw them out
there could be more than us right I just want to
get a quick peek if we can
 You wouldnt mind
 Consonants are gone
 That my lads was a dragon
 Eldritch Blast on the other one
 Yeah I rolled the first one which was a
 but with advantage Thats less so 
 Oh yeah Im sorry  for the first
roll

 Old habits they die hard Nine points of
damage

they came from while they pillage
 Casks
 Well whatve we got are we happy
 Are you going to carry the sledgehammer
 Not for you Beast Mode
 Yeah Ill take it
 Ill tuck the rod into my belt
 You can
 Maybe we view this an opportunity to grow and
we look for those now
 Great
 Yeah Anything that looks out of the
ordinary out of place On the wall on the floors
 Are you still shithoused Are you fucking
hammered still
 Okay she needs another shot
 Yeah
 I know the feeling
 Do you want to check air current
temperature Nothing Anything
 Temperature equal on both sides
 You know what could be really handy in
this situation is some of that fancy fucking
thread of yours
 Yeah I dont mind commiting to one of
these tunnels I just want to make sure nothing
comes behind us or comes up from the other way
 Because youre hammered
 Yes
 You sussed it out
 
 Dont make a sound
 How many total
 I dont like seven on eight I am not a
fan
 Good thing were metal
 I mean I hate it but
 Plus were in a mine
 Theres a big column thats in between
them right
 Is it a column or a stalagmite
 Do you want to throw the rod at the
column
 Theres another path down
 Behind them and make them turn away from
us Because were in a fatal funnel up here at the top
 I genuinely feel like we should go the
other way
 Theres a whole other path
 No
 Do you know
 Can I use this planning moment to cast
Armor of Agathys on myself
 Spectral frost collects from the air on my
armor
 I didnt give myself enough cold damage
 If we need to close it off light the tip
of that little wick and throw it
 What kind of a check was it
 Im ready
 Can you point to one of them that is not
undead Just looks like a regular gnoll or I can
just pick one
 Great Did you aim at that one
 Okay Ill take that far one
 Can I focus and summon my falchion into my
hand
 Can I use my bonus action to cast Hex at
that right gnoll
 Can I reach back and fire Eldritch Blast
into it
 
 Six plus four ten d  points of
damage
 Can I use my distance to move over here

fucking ball bearings

have put a ring on it
 That will hit
 Okay
 It will take ten points of cold damage in
return
 Thats it
 Oh it is my turn Can I use my bonus
action to move my Hex from my defeated foe to my
new foe right in front of me
 Yeah and can I whip my falchion around
and upstrike just try and cut right through him
 Thats only a

through
 Slap that bitch
 Get your hands dirty
 One point of damage All of us
 Are you still intoxicated
 Or has that shit worn off with some
activity
 Nope
 Oh shit
 There was no question
 Jester could you give me a heal a little
bit I took a little bit of a beating
 We have the silver thread up top right
 Oh it took a few minutes didnt it
 I think its in front of us
 A short rest doesnt get us spells back
does it
 Id like to volunteer that perhaps we move
forward until we can see whether there are any
living people that we can help and we make a
decision then
 That went far better than the village but
also that big armored bastard wasnt there
 The booze
 Yep
 We got to go Cant fuck around with mama

 Anybody feel like going up and giving ole
Claudia a door rap at her office
 No
 Wow yall
 It works
 Yeah wed like to avoid entanglements
with the law being so new and all
 Maybe it might be wise to ask
any particular groups to avoid while were here
 Were slightly aware
 Well they frown
 Yeah getting the good shit right now
 Are there any particular groups of people
that are responsible for unsavory business in the
city Any identifying clothing or memorabilia they
might have on them
 No just perhaps to keep an eye out for in
case we sought employment from the wrong type
 Head tutor you said

 Xerox
 Just right out in the open huh
 As were heading down I lean over to
Beau
 The two of us are going
 I lean over to Beau and I say
 I dont
know if youre aware of it but when you
compliment people it sounds like a fucking insult
Is that intentional
 It was just an observation Like
commenting on the office window Youve gotta put
more smile
 It didnt quite sound that way
 Yeah Just something to put in your hat
 Yeah go for it
 Yeah so lets start with maybe a little
smile on the face Thats always a good starting
point Try again
 Oh man you look constipated

can tell you were actually trying to be nice
 Apologies We dont mean to intrude Were

 The syphilis itch

 Although I mean credit would help our
you know reputation
 Jester any interest in chasing down that
guy and seeing where the news is gathered Maybe
they could print a retraction
 Or where it comes from
 You look like me
 But Fjord does accents
 Yeah of course Not to alarm you I only
meant that if we are going to be paid for our
escapades a reputation anonymously might help
if we belong to that name
 No

intention

 Well weve lost Caleb Should we discuss
the potential job offers that weve collected

any attention

risk

webs
 Yeah because well have bank and 
then we can get room service and shit

shit later
 It gets real turnt up when this here
starts playing
 A silver
 Fucking start small man
 Now the beats all off
 Yeah
 Ive been looking at some of the folks
around here I think theyre overexaggerating the
importance of this beast
 Yeah I think we should at least go down
there and take a look
 Nah I dont think so Im not a super fan
of the sewer during the day I figure Ill like it
even less at night
 Ooh yeah Do we know where that guy is
 The guy that came running back
 That Voloshin said that one of them ran
back from the task
 Yeah
 Good thinking
 How long does it take to get over to the
TriSpire area find us a manhole
 Is it early afternoon or late afternoon
 Well be fine
 Yeah why not
 Were definitely going now
 Hey lets do it Youll walk your buzz
off
 Not with your nerd goggles
 How about we casually make our way over
and as were doing that we can keep an eye out for
kingsguard and see if they know of this guy
 One of those shitty dueling shawls that
they throw off
 Warren T Rat in American Tail
 Oh Jesus Please no
 Yeah this is your opportunity to shine
Get em
 Explain what were doing
 Oh
 Seems reasonable enough
 Do you know if the sewers flooded any time
during the day Any sort of unexpected water flows
 When people ask you who were those brave souls
that ventured into sewer you tell them The Mighty Nein
Good The Bad and The Ugly
 Whos first
 Yeah Get in there tank
 Yasha
 No he just closed it Jester
 What do we think Go up or down Up
right
 I put the glove of blasting on my left
hand
 What the fuck did you just draw
 If you ever make a road sign people are
fucked That is
 Yep Thats some old fucking Street
Fighter combo shit
 You really want to go south You two
 I like that logic
 Bobby Tarantino territory Lets do it Lets go
south
 Asshole

 Nobody is going to ask you why you know
that Just so were clear you dont need to
explain anymore
 I think maybe we should head back in the
opposite direction
 Since youre tasting hemorrhoids in the
water its probably coming from that direction
 Lets do it
 The curved surface of this area can we
see the ceiling clearly or is it way above us
 Dust
 Yeah Swords in the middle
 Im going to go ahead and cast Armor of
Agathys get on the spectral frost armor
 Its the snowcone variety
 Scratching sounds a rat and were all
like 
 Its actual shit
  as well Natural 
 Zero
 Im a limited fucking warlock
 I turn to see where all of them are in
relation to the party Are there any sons of
bitches over here that I cant see
 Okay great I turn around and I see Caleb
being flanked by two of them and I know he is
super squishy Can I run towards this rat
 Can I reach back with my hand and
 That hits
 The rat takes ten points of frost damage
 I reach back to strike the rat As my hand
comes down Ill summon the falchion into my hand
and strike down
 Its a 
 It was onehanded so d
Ten points of damage
 Oh shit
 Nine 
 Yes it does
 I got nervous
  I have reservations about
killing a sewer dog
 You could flip it bladeup
 Its in my mouth
 That shit doesnt work
 Punching the fuck out of rats
 Fuck you you dirty rat
 Its down here Its rats were not using
that shit

 Ray

 Save You got it smash it Youre rolling
the bad dice again
 You gotta look in the camera
 Oh good yeah
 Yup Nostrils are burned right the fuck
out
 You know this really isnt what we need
This is only the appetizer maybe we should try to
find the main course
 Yeah I think stealth would be a good
idea
 To the right
 Or just dont disturb them
 You normally touch a spiders web they
come running
 Can we see a past that into any further
clumps of webbing
 
 Do we have to break any of the planes of
webbing to get to this cluster
 Quite a while but Ill remind you that
our mission is not to retrieve any guards Its to
kill this beast
 That was dark and angry
 Shall we move forward to the first plane
of webbing that would hinder our movement
 Does it interact with the environment
 What do we like more Poking the webbing
or sending it up in flame
 Might as well
 My way of thinking is what if that web is
sticky as shit I dont want to get caught in it
 How about a poke and then a flame
 That way Nott doesnt have bad dreams that
we burn some people that are still alive and then
we can set it all on fire
 Oh right
 So theyre dead huh
 Firestarter
 How about four on one side and three on
the other of the tunnel
 Ill take the front of the other side of
Yasha since Ive got some armor
 Wow Fucking betrayal Okay
 Hey Nott will you do me a favor and make
sure nothing sneaks up behind us
 Could be
 Can I search for puncture marks Stab
wounds Bite marks
 Ten on the medicine check
 So big fangs Probably fucking pincers
You know  Yeah So watch your shit
 Hows the ground that were standing on
now
 But the stone is unim
 Not tacky
 The worst kind of candy
 Or if we go up to the grate and try and
get someone to open the hatch in case we need to
beat a speedy retreat
 Yeah do it
 Give her the writ of law thing
 Is there an A in that
 If you had to ballpark the distance to the
halfling or to the very end of it
 I am going to join Nott at the back and
keep an eye on the rear
 Ten
 Against my  Yeah
 I do so he takes ten points of damage
The armor is gone
 Shit 
 Fuck
 Oh look at the webs
 Invisible shit ass bitch Nipples on a
horse
 I have  as well Nobody has higher than
a 
 Yeah I mean besides Jester
 Youre both 
 Good separated from everybody
 Nothing happens
 Okay can I spin back after getting
fucking bit by a goddamn spider and can I back up

 Cool I dont see nothing right
 Nice Can I fire Eldritch Blast in the
direction that I saw it

you it hits
 Damn
 Okay constitution saving throw

 Im unconscious No Relentl
The thing I got the thing Its called Relentless
Endurance I come back to one hit point
 Sorry Im half dead
 Oh fuck
 What dice are you using
 Yeah this is the second fight
 Fuck yeah beast mode
As you rush towards it with a large arc 
slamming down like
 you carve through part of its carapace
two of the eyes are cloven through and are now
bloodied and ruined
 Im going to take a healing potion
 Yeah
 Its my turn
 With my bonus action can I cast
Hexblades Curse on the spider
 With the fucking glove of blasting that
we took off the thing can I go  and
fire all three of the Scorching Ray balls at the
spider
 Thats a nine plus two for 
 Thats a one
 
 Thats right Eight points of damage
 Plus two to hit thats it No damage
two proficiency Thank you
 Ten thank you
 Yeah
 You just got to kill the spider and Ill
be fine
 Woo crit on that shit
 
 What the fuck
 No shes path of the zealot
 Whats that called what did you use
 You dont need to heal me
 If it dies I gain seven hit points
 Thanks Jester I owe you one
 Were not considered poisoned if we got
bit right
 Id like to move closer to the group
 I turn here and I will hold my attack
 Yes
 I dont get a ranged
 Yeah Do I have to say ranged spell

 Sorry Ive learned
 Ooh I like the risk
 You got it
 Dont move dont move
 I regain seven hit points

 Far Cry 
 Fantastic multiplayer and allnew setting
It takes place in the United States of America
 Thats right I even heard you could check
it out Ubisofts Far Cry 
 Jagged at the tip
 I hate spiders Im fucking out
 Oh the pouches that you took
 He dies first
  
 I have no coin willing to offer many
gifts
 Pretty sure we can call for someone with
our
 How many of these victims were other than
crownsguard Any civilians or women children
 Well what did you find on the bodies
Sorry
 Yeah What did we find
 Nice
 Anything unique Any unique things
 Sure
 Can I happen to see am I able to see the
guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff
 Oh cool Do I recognize any of the names
of ships or any imagery
 Ugh 
 Yeah
 Insight check

 One way to find out
 Im just waiting
 Nott
 Oh Well wasnt the plan to have a what
did you call it
 Oh Jesus Christ Garmin over here
 If I may you raise a good point Nott If
we for some reason get caught being where were
not supposed to I think that writ only allows us
to kill this beast and return it for the coin
 I would not want to gamble with our reward
of  gold Perhaps we should leave and collect
our reward and then find our revelries elsewhere
 This is a good point
 We can walk
 Yeah the Kings Hall
 Dinner
 Yeah Mighty Nein stay back Nein

 Yeah
 Indeed in fact it would turn invisible
when it wasnt trying to stick its fangs into all
of our gang
 With that accent all those letters
disappear
 Dont punch him dont no
 We lost two in the sewers

 Oh yeah Im moderately okay at this Oh
no
 Okay deception where the fuck is it Oh
its 
 Who picked up all those items anyway
 Were staying over at the
 Although some of us were taking up at a
room at the
  gold
 Of course We appreciate the law in this
town and the services you provide You can lean
on us for any further needs you might have
 Yeah
  A shitty hole
 Yeah but it hasnt changed at all
 If anything later in the day it gets
worse Im just letting you know
 We do have some extra coin Maybe hes got
some fancier shit to buy
 For someone who knows the exact time
of night you are shit with directions
 Agreed Should we head back clean up
 Yeah
 Sure if youd like
 Im not repeating that word
 Wow Wish I had that before Yeah I think
a trade would be fine but Ill trade you for a
story of why your past is so checkered with flame
You seem to trust in me enough to tell me about it
 Thats too bad
 Sure You know weve all harmed people
but I hope that you will learn to trust me in
time and I appreciate you sharing that Here Im
fairly certain that you will do far more damage
with this than my shitty attempt did
 Of course Thanks for the armor What does
it look like

 All good things Thank you for this
 Yeah youre welcome
 Were going to get clean first because
good god were going to clear out that fucking
tavern
 But Matt
 Im certainly not trying to hide it
 Grumpyass wingman makes me look better in
comparison
 Who Which one
 I shuffle in with like a towel Nott What
the fuck

 Get out
 Shoo Shoo

 Son of a bitch
 Oh with the buzzed head
 Of course
  Dont talk
 Well we come from all sorts of different
backgrounds I happen to be very handy at sea
know my way around a merchant area Beau
 At times we can be quite quiet
 I would say its safe to say that they
dont have sentiments opposed to yours
 Just letting you know that coin always
helps but we did see the posting outside the
Kings Hall about uprisings against the Empire It
seems the heat on your group might be quite intense
 What cancers are you looking to remove I
would tell you that tomorrow night the devil lies
in the details and that will depend
 Good night
 Wow That was really good Like you
didnt act like a total shitfuck
 Whatever it was yeah lock it in That
was great Really nice
 That was promising
 About that I mean shit I cant really
speak to it I have to figure out what they want
to do tomorrow
 Thats right If its amateur hour were
going to be shooting ourselves in the foot
 No joke Especially since we just got
here
 Yeah what the fuck
 Beer
 Okay
 Hey
 I wasnt sure what our next engagement
might be but it seems like we might not have to
wait that long
 Well not through the city per se but
remember that group that we joined the other day
 No that is not at all no no We joined
their meeting right We did not join them we
didnt participate
 We were in the presence of an attended
meeting of individuals
 Maybe its just us we just go
fuck these other
 Tomorrow evening theres going to be a
meeting of that same group and they would like to
hire our services
 Why Am I speaking real loud
 Do you want me to write it down
 Okay Ill write it down for Jester but
for everybody else

 Tomorrow at midnight were going to see
what it is they want to do and if the moneys
right and if its not stupid
 Well since its in the same place its
in the same cellar I figure you guys can keep
watch above while were getting info down below
We dont all need to be down in the same place
 Wheres your cat
 Was it one kick Just one
 Youd have to you get kicked into a
fucking other dimension
 Did you get a name or a face I mean are
we going
 Thats really hard to do very small and
hard to catch
 And in the south
 Wait so we all just got clean and were
going to get back into the sewers to get to the TriSpires
 How about we dive bar it tonight then
 Start a tab were looking to tie one on
tonight Were celebrating
 Killed a fucking giant invisible spider
friend
 I appreciate that Can I ask your name
 Nice to meet you Clive
 Noticed some toughlooking types out
front
 I know I know
 Hes just locked in
 Orcish blood
 Thank you Jester Clive were not
looking for any trouble
 Is there any music or is it just low
murmured conversation
 We walked into the Russian Mafia
 Do you have a menu You dont you dont
 The tattoo is familiar or hes familiar
 Does the floor look barren Wood Any
rugs coverings
 We did a little recon
 Have we slept after our spider bite
 Are these your type of people
 With some quiches and some mimosas
 University of Virginia youll find it
 Well not in that fucking place shit
Somewhere better
 Yeah I think so
 Probably one of those ones too where you
pick it up and it fucking automatically charges
you Dicks
 Yeah theyre little seals little arcane
seals underneath it You pick it up and try to put
it back but the seals gone
 Yep
 You know if were just going back Pumat
Sol what was the name of his spot
 No it wasnt
 Oh yeah How far away is the Invulnerable
Vagrant
 Is it late evening like premidnight
or
 You know what never mind Ill do it
another day
 Are we still in our rooms or are we
downstairs
   Damn it
 I believe they said there would be more I
mean we dont really have anything until this
evening remember theres that meeting that we
have
 Its going to take place in the cellar
 You guys are going to join this time
 Well you dont all have to come Some can
stay above I just wanted to put the invite out there
 You know I wanted to talk to you about
your Fjord disguise It is just a little obvious
 I would want to see what your range was
in case you wanted to I dont know perhaps mimic
one of our other companions
 Maybe just one of them Maybe youve got a
patch over the other
 Bald on top and red hair on the sides
 Overalls with polka dots and a real big
bow tie And shoes bigger than you should be wearing
 No Not at all

 Just mull it over Add it to your
 Youre rolling your minds Rolodex
 Sometimes having a pupil teaches you
something about yourself Just saying
 Give it a shot
 Thanks Jester I appreciate that
 Youre not going to do the cloudyeye
thing when youre down in the meeting though right
 You go all static channel on us we might
be in deep shit
 Thats not until this evening right
 Yeah I do I enjoyed his company so much
last time Feel like weve got a little more coin
to spend might be smart to stock up on items
 Why
 Oh Thought your mom was going to pay for
it
 Oh good point
 Thats very smart of you Jester
 Should we set out to our various tasks
then
 Im going to the Invulnerable Vagrant
 Yeah You will love him
 Oh thats three Do I hear four Four
Four 

 Thats my auctioneer
 Can I grab my Mariners studded leather
armor out of my room and bring it with
  Vulnerable Thought it was the
Invulnerable
 Oh got it
 Nice We go in
 Good to see you again Boy it is sure
coming down outside wish there was a way to dry
off real fast
 I am
  Fuck  What does
it smell like
 Sour cream and onion chips
 Well see what we can do
 That is much better Thank you Pumat
That is wonderful
 I had a question for you
 we found this
armor down in the sewers and it seems to have some
 Right yeah
 Have you seen this armor before
 Yeah heres the thing I spent a lot of
time by the water when I was growing up and when
you live by the water too much water theme in
your design is overkill You know its like the
person that has the beach house and everything is
shells and water and lobsters
 Yeah I feel like this has some unique
properties to it Is there a chance that I could
I dont know in some way transfer or copy some of
that onto what Im currently wearing I have a
little bit more intrinsic value with what I have
 Theyre not really attached Im sorry
 I dont know if shells fall out so be
careful
 I forgot to tell you there are multiple
versions of Pumat Apparently the other ones are
called Me me
 Nott hands in your pockets all right
 Okay
 Is there any chance you could tell me how
much it might cost
 Hes really very nice and accommodating
 Im sorry a little  Eight zero or
one eight 
 Right Okay let me think on it a bit
Nott you had a request
 Thats mighty good
 You get a fucking concussion
 You know Pumat I think will take you up
on that enchantment  gold Its a bit more than
I was hoping to spend I could overhear you
offering an incentive for being a return customer
I did enjoy most recently unfortunately one of
your healing potions Perhaps if I purchased a
healing potion and the transfer of the
enchantments we could find some sort of a deal
 Get it get it boy  Its not
terrible
 I understand Healing potions were how
much again  gold
  gold Wow I got to work on my fucking
memory Great I will take a healing potion and
the enchantment transfer please
 
 Okay thank you
 Yeah I take the breastplate part of my
leather armor off and leave it with you
 Yeah that would be
 Its not that bad You dont have to act
like it
 New leather
 Thats amazing
 It gives you some bonus
 Yeah we all do
 Super squishyass crispy tacos
 I think you only have to kill the one
 This conversation did not happen in the
game by the way
 Got to attune to it
 Yeah I mean weve got some good momentum
right now right What could possibly happen
 It looks incredible Its found a place
 Pumat before we go I wanted to ask you I
know that youre an annex of the Cerberus
Assembly How do you feel about the governing
parties here in town Are you happy with the way
things are run
 Right
 Yeah I think its great that you support
the barracks Do they come in for regular
purchases every week or every month or find
themselves in your store more often than not
 The members of the Cerberus Assembly
 Thats wonderful Well thank you thank
you for your time
 Oh really Theyre not as protective of
certain knowledges as other parts of the
government might be
 But they might be a bit more openminded
to people sharing in that knowledge if they were
the right type of person say
 Im glad to hear that Nott Molly You
have everything you need
 Did you want to bring the mirror with you
 I was joking
 Give Pumat Prime our best
 Fuck
 Thank you for not making me stand out in
the rain for an hour without top pieces Thank you
 Oh oh oh
 Maybe you know it
 Your hands are going to be all sticky
before you handle the books
 Yep Detail
 Four score
 My shirts gone back up

  A squared plus B squared
equals C squared
 Angels and demons
 Breasts or breaths
 
 In a hole in the ground
 Tumblr is so happy right now
 The gauge of his pipe
 Yeah you were doing it
 Is there a mailing list
 Want to see my toys
 Good luck adding that shit
 Can I pull Molly aside Hey I wanted to
ask you When you stopped Nott from rifling
through my shit last night what was she looking
for
 She wasnt grabbing for anything in
particular
 She going through your stuff too or just
mine
 Just cant help herself I guess
 Fair enough
 Im going to wander around the back side
of The Leaky Tap
 I didnt Actually I happened to ask
Pumat Sols the plural and he happens to be like
an annex shop of the Cerberus Assembly
 So he supplies goods to all parts of the
kingdom but he says they keep a good balance in
check from the power of the empire Keeps a tight
leash I didnt ask about any religious uprising
or anything but he seems like such a nice guy and
doesnt seem the type to rat
 Nobody stopped you You got in all right
 Oh good Howd that go
 Well I was just thinking for this
evening maybe we should doublecheck there arent
alternate exits coming in and out of that cellar
 Yeah that dwarf didnt really give me a
very good feeling
 Right You want to walk around the back to
see if theres another way in
 Can we go around the back of the tavern
and look for back doors floor latches
 Ill help you make it
 Which ones did you roll
 With the plus
 Locked off chained Does this alley have
a lot of human traffic or are we on our own
 I mean I have a crowbar
 Yeah I have a crowbar
 Can I try and pop the lock Is it like a
chain and a lock
 Oh shit Thats not as good
 Yeah thats true That is what she does
You want to go snag her Ill keep an eye
 I do a quick look Both ends of the alleys
and on the windows around the area
 Mines okay 
 Shh I cover her mouth
 No windows
 No windows facing that way
 I have my orc
 Go for it yeah Might as well use that
 Thats cocked
 I come down at the mention of a skeletal
wrist Are there any other bodies in this cellar
 Well Im going to leave because were all
three down here and go back up to the top and keep
an eye
 No other ways in or out huh
 Close the door up run the chain back
through put the lock on it but dont lock it
 Not really because if Calebs going to be
down there with us I think if we start
screaming or you hear a ruckus
 See down there Im not so worried
 Yeah somebody outside The Leaky Tap
another person on the inside to run interference
because you can buy us a couple seconds
 Yeah couple layers right
 Nah
 Im so happy
 I remember my  and yearold
excursions into the back of the comic book store
with the  and up section Oh man How old are
you kid Pretty old
 Yeah
 A risky 
 Areski
 We dont even know who he is yet right
 I am too
 Yeah and I was thinking So the three of
us are down in the meeting
 The three of us Nott if you could be
outside letting us know if any crownsguard or
other surly types look like theyre coming in to
raid the place you send a Message and then you
two run interference if they actually make it
inside the doors in case we havent made it out yet
 Yeah whatever you do buy us some time
 I believe you
 These Knights of Requital
  Damn it Son of a bitch
 What you reading there Jester
 Of course you are In size  font in your
fucking notebook
 Does it
 No leave it alone Stop
 Sick
 Did we recognize the other human male that
hes with
 Does he seem to be armed or shady or
have lots of scars on his person
 
 How were his shoes
 Thats right yeah
 Dolans last name
 Sure Any reason why
 Taverski
 Sure Is this guy from where youre from
or something Old mate of yours
 Taverski Would he know you if I was like
Hey friend of ours named Nott
 Ill find out his last name Im sure he
wont mind
 Thats right Crownsguard roughlooking
types people that are armed right
You keep a fucking swivel
 Its your best disguise yet
 Nott Oh Im sorry I forgot it was you
for a minute
 Oh Tton
 Tton Yeah
TTon
 You ready
 Lets see what they want to do
 Its these three jackasses
 Yeah Ill take a seat
 We havent said too much but we thought
that he might be somebody youd be interested in
Very clever has no love for the Empire
 Thought we could let you decide for
yourself
 Caleb this is Dolan Dolan this is
Caleb Dolan do you have a last name
 Well I have one question This Lord
Sutan Whats to keep the HighRichter and the
Lawmaster from just going and snatching him up and
putting him in chains
 Yeah well were going to forge this
letter from Lord Sutan right Saying that theres
an assassination attempt against the Richter We
go to the Richters place we tossle it then we
deliver a letter from Sutan saying there was an
attempt of the Richters life So if I was the
Richter and I went to the Lawmaster Id just go
disappear Lord Sutan Your Richter will stay in
his seat and youll be short one Lord if Im not
mistaken
 Horris if you dont mind me asking what
was your practice
 As well
 Im not shy of a conscience Im afraid
Id need to know a little bit more about this
HighRichter Prucine Hopefully hes a terrible
individual
 I remember you saying that
 I mean I hate to say anything else
without seeing something for ourselves You seem
to have a good plan for getting rid of Sutan but
it seems you might need some further measures to
get rid of this Richter as well
 Do you feel like the Empire or the
Lawmaster is onto your group Your Knights of
Requital Do they know your name
 I have a proposal for you Are you one
hundred percent sure that they havent heard of
your name Knights of Requital How attached are
you to that name
 If you ever want someone to stop looking
for something theyll stop as soon as they know
that thing is gone or dead So how about we frame
HighRichter Prucine as the head of this Knights
of Requital and let the law handle it the way they
will And well take care of Lord Sutan at the
same time
 I hate to do away with a great name but
you work with what you have
 You could workshop it
 Do you have any secret symbols Or stamps
or seals that you use for communication that we
could plant in the house or the place of dwelling
of the HighRichter A ring a piece of jewelry
 If we frame this the right way it sure
would do a lot for your ambitions to become that
HighRichter Dolan if you were the ones to turn
in the evidence
 I think it would be
 Yeah This will work
 Is her name Kara
 Kara I like the enthusiasm you had about
your plan What sort of skills could you bring to
this equation Are you stealthy Sneaky
 That can be done We have other
associates upstairs We didnt want to encroach
too much on your space Wed like time to confer
with them over the night perhaps meet again
midday tomorrow We should find a new spot
though Repetition is a recipe for disaster
 Were actually quite new Maybe you could
provide one
 Consult your paperwork
 Song and Supper Inn
 How far from here How much time to
travel Not far
 Fair enough Shall we call it just after
noon tomorrow
 The Inquiry Its got a nice ring to it
 Thank you for trusting us I believe we
can make quite the impact with these movements
 You gotta pull up Pull up
 You see Fjord shift his weight
 Would you like to exit first or should
we
 Much obliged I head out
 Wow louder than I thought it would be
Thank you Nott
 Yeah thank you for keeping an eye out
Would you like to join us inside
 Nott Would you like to Hello
 Thanks for keeping an eye out
 Caleb impressions
 Well my takeaway is that they want to
unseat some of the corrupted seats of power here
in the city If thats true if there is an abuse
of power Im all for removing those corrupted
seats and putting people of worth in their place
Im also not keen on taking the word of someone
else without getting some evidence of our own
 We dont While were following them
perhaps we should try and find out what we can
about this Lean in closer Closer This
HighRichter Prucine
 I dont know
 I couldnt see it
 Yeah it should be every time Its a rule
 You can drop that uh
 You know what we also need I want some
eyes on this HighRichter
 We should find out where she lives and how
she treats people see if the stories are true
 Sure We might need to find out where she
lives tonight though
 I should have asked but I forgot
 No the HighRichter is just an official
 Not if you have official business with the
Richter
 Its very urgent business
 Exactly what I was going to suggest
 Well we dont need to Caleb
 To answer Calebs question we kind of
forgot to discuss that part
 Were new at this We will address that
tomorrow for sure before we proceed any further
Youre right there should be compensation
 No I think we should all go They should
get a look at us as a whole see who theyre
dealing with just in case theres any shady
shit
 What would you like to look like
 Its at your discretion
 Anybody feel like finding out where this
HighRichter lives this evening
 Lets do it How do we do that

 Thats a great idea
 Jester
 Charm him ask
 What about that big white dragonborn
maybe he knows
 Yeah Perhaps we should rest tonight and
plan this little needyfolk charade in the
morning We can always take the sewers into the
TriSpires
 Caleb youve mentioned you tried to get
into the TriSpires and you had a disguise on and
it didnt
 Do you think it was just in that passage
way or do you think its the entire TriSpire area
 The entire TriSpire
 Thatll be it We use the sewers to get
in disguise ourselves avoid detection find out
what we need to know
 Shall we retire for the night
 Ill head up to my room first and Ill
pull Molly up with me because I need to have a
word with him Molly listen I cant get over the
fact that Nott was going through my stuff I want
to set a little bit of a trap
 Yeah I just want to see if shes learned
her lesson or not
 Im going to put an object in the middle
of the room with our door open and were going to
hide out of sight You game
 Great Ill use Minor Illusion to put in
the middle of the room a bundle of buttons with a
tall shiny flask covered in jewels right in the
middle of the room
 I mean I guess so Once shes in were
going to shut the door I want to figure out what
the fuck shes sneaking around for
 Okay
 
 Its just an open door with a bunch of
buttons and a flask in it
 As soon as she comes in the door the door
slams shut Molly get the window
 Nott
 No We are going to have a talk Dont try
any funny business Why are you trying to sneak
through our stuff
 Molly told me Molly told me you were in
here rifling through my stuff
 What were you looking for
 Do I believe her
 Natural 
 Thats why I brought you in here
 My letter But Nott why
 Well why What would Caleb do with it
 You wouldnt want me to have that sort of
ability youd rather Caleb have it
 You do
 Why Nott Why do you need him to be
powerful
 Nott what do you need to be saved from
 Absolutely
  Nott I hope you will
learn to trust us and rely on us like you do
Caleb We may not be as powerful as he is or has
the ability to become but certainly we can help
you Are you worried about something or someone in
particular finding you
 I understand Im sorry if weve upset
you
 Not for some reason Im just cool in
general Nott Im just cool in general Nott
 This shit is amazing
 Just for now though
 Promise me that you will not go through my
things anymore when Im not around and that the
items that I have belong to me
 Change you
  I understand I know what
it feels like to be ashamed or worried about what
you look like I do
 You think so
 Well I didnt always look like this
 I wasnt always a handsome halfmonster
thing
 A kid just like anyone else
 Yeah
 Yeah Stumpy short Big teeth
 Little bit Just sort of misproportioned
Listen if we get to the
 If my MySpace is still up you could see
them Goes back a tick
 Nope No I did my own dental work
Listen if we get to the Soltryce Academy and that
letter doesnt do me any good I promise you
could have it and well make sure Caleb has a
shot
 Most definitely
 You look out for us well look out for
you
 You cannot have my stuff
 Okay easy Easy Open up the door I open
the door and I slowly open it up like trying to
funnel a rat out of the room Here you go
Remember what we talked about
 I stick my foot out right when she runs
by
 You should be fine
 Man that was more than I thought
 What do you make of all that
 Are you praying over your swords tonight
 All right Can I join you
 Great
 Yeah the hard turn
 Killed it in one night Damn
 Yep Downstairs
 Oh thats the worst
 Would you call it a blue balls feeling
 Morning Nott
 So we set out our plan Sewers Make
ourselves look like poor folk Make our way into
the TriSpire
 Upper middle
 Medium well
 Do we know if the HighRichters normally
rule on or govern over
 Or stolen by the Baumbauchs I mean if we
do something that a family within the TriSpire
needed representation the law upheld but the
Richter turned an eye because a more powerful
family was winning out then that person is shit
 From the brewery that we took in session
zero
 I dont know if he would hold sway but if
he doesnt pursue justice for someone of the
TriSpire that should tell us enough The
Baumbauchs are very influential and powerful
 What do you think Molly
 Doesnt Timalt make hardware
 If the HighRichter doesnt say Youre
right this is injustice lets take it to the
Lawmaster then that Richter sucks
 Puppy crime
 So they stole from our invoice and they
took all our Saint Bernard puppies
 Okay
 What time exactly of the day
 Oh god
 Yeah we have to
 Well lets pick up your cloak and make
our way
 Why didnt we try to forge a writ 
damn it
 I could have one of them beat the shit out
of the other one
 Lets do that I cast Crown of Madness on
one of the guards
 Hopefully from an area where they dont
see me casting it
 Oh no
 
 Oh I have advantage Nah
 Yes it is 
 Kick his ass sea bass
 Nott Quick let the lock on the sewer
thing lets go
 I thought it was locked
 
 Everybody in
 
 Yeah I mightve fucked that thing up
 He might get demoted a couple days pay
 No come on
 Ten
 Did not think about what to do once we got
into this part of the plan
 Right yeah
 Yeah I cast Disguise Self Very long
black cloak with gold trim like a nice trim
goatee and slicked back jet black hair Piercing
blue eyes nice looking human
 Cloak gold trim
 Great analogy
 Fated to do well
 Hello sir excuse me
 Im sorry to bother you we have business
with the HighRichter Is there a chance that you
could point us in his direction her direction
 I really dont care were just delivering
a parcel
 Wonderful thank you for your time
 Nott your mustache is much nicer
 Do you know what a mime is You just mime
this mission
 Ask for an audience yeah Maybe if we say
that we were sent by the Lawmaster for the
HighRichter to make a ruling
 Good instinct what do you think
 Jester Id like you to come
 Nice Molly what do you want to do
 Indeed What would your name be in this
situation
 Im just trying to think ahead
 Lovely
 Lawrence
 Are you staying out here with Nott Caleb
or are you going to come in If we make it in
 Thats right Wish us luck
 I walk up to one of the two crownsguard
outside the door
 Yes please look lively unfortunately
weve been sent here from the Lawmaster we have
some very urgent business with HighRichter
Prucine Please if you wouldnt mind would you
fetch her
 Natural 
 Oh HighRichter its so lovely to see
you again I know its been quite a while
 Brantley We met must have been years ago
now You remember the Gala
 Yeah  plus four 
 I understand A bit of terrible business
actually Our family has been unfortunately at the
poor end of some corporate espionage and Im
afraid the Baumbauchs isnt that who they are in
Trostenwald
 Just a wretched fellow Theyve made off
with quite a bit of our product and we have some
evidence against them We tried to take it to the
Lawmaster of course we didnt want to trouble
you but
 Absolutely
 Im sure justice will be swift but
unfortunately much of our familys finances are
wrapped up in this
 At least you have the diamond right
 Im sure you can understand our situation
We have already done that exact thing We wouldnt
waste your time with such rudimentary worries
but
 Well frankly the Lawmaster in
Trostenwald seemed to show you very little respect
when we mentioned your name and being that our
family is so influential around here were going
to be tossed to the wayside if justice isnt
found Surely you understand that
 Was that what you said
 It was merely a few pennies for your
time
 Yes I mean certainly if you feel like
doing justice on its own I would like to see
people taken care of that take care of us
 Well of course
 Yes I believe we are Thank you for your
time Were most gracious
 But since were inside of that sevenfoot
floors
 Shuttered Wooden shuttered closed
 I mean theyre kicking cats in this
bitch so its not that far off
 You embarrass me
 Please make sure shes beaten as you lead
her away I apologize for his fuddyduddyness
 Thank you for your time Good day
 Yeah that was good Well we walk a fair
distance away from the crownsguard and we see
Caleb and little pallbearer
 Like a small Morticia Addams
 Well I mean she said that dogs should be
fed to the larger ones
 Right but imagine if she had gotten her
eyes on you I mean dont know what she would
have done
 But that means shes got to die
 Is it just the TriSpire or is it
everywhere
 Certainly your fears are founded If
theres not enough pay then obviously its not
worth the risk But I have to say that even after
meeting them for the second time I feel like
these people theyre good folks I think they
just want to see their city bettered Honestly
that Dolan fellow I think would do better in a
seat of power than this current wench
 I think thats fair
 And theres still many things to figure
out We have to look after this Lord Sutan But
first we should see to that afternoon meeting
about the coin We should address that straight out
 Yeah I guess we do Were meeting them at
the Song  Supper Inn
 Just after noon
 I was not specific
 Yeah Dont make me say it
 Im trying not to
 It took us  minutes to walk here
 The rest of you are welcome
 Molly keep an eye on the room
  Weve got to look for that
motherfucker more often
 Sure We did some casing of the
HighRichter ourselves Shes not the most savory
type I believe some of my associates have a
question of well the unsavory topic of payment
 Thats about the same as the Kings Hall
yeah
 Would anyone of your group like to be
joining us Kara or Ulog yourself
 I tend to believe him just because we
havent seen him
 Did you happen to draft up any of those
Knights of Requital documents I asked for
Symbols
 Thats actually nice work
 I hate to burn it though
 Got Dolan drawing it
 A moment for us to confer if you dont
mind
 I dont get that impression do you
 Maybe not just yet
 I like the offer though
 Theyll get their return back if hes
HighRichter afterwards though
 Were just being paid to empty the seat
not to put him in it
 Nott Caleb I know you had reservations
 Well see what kind of plan we can come up
with We have a day
 You hear thunder
 We have a day right
 When we will strike Jester how do you
feel
 Oh okay
 We can call them back over
 Til tomorrow
 I actually like what Molly said I feel
like tomorrow night before we go you should do
your thing on Ulog
 That would work great I think theyd
understand too If we did it too early I think
they cause you to cause suspicion After all
were only trying to make sure that this isnt a
trap set for us
 Make you feel better if we had the
answer
 What do we do this evening to prepare
 Well I was thinking more along the lines
of checking out Lord Sutan
 They just left and we forgot to ask where
the fuck he is Twice Can we run out after them
 Oh god Oh 
 One sec 
 You dropped this money  Where
do we find Lord Sutan
 Just take it and say thank you
 Okay dont worry about it

They dont know
 Yeah
 They know where he lives
 In the TriSpire
 Yeah Maybe that guard got his job back
 Im sure hes fine
 Well we got to figure out where the Lord
Sutans estate is get a wax seal a writing
forge his hand
 Fair enough
Yeah at dawn we plan
 Yep
 We got Pumat Sol back man We need Pumat
every once and awhile
 Thats right
 Were all fucked
 Whats the lawmasters name
 At the Song and Supper Inn
 Weve got to figure out where fucking Lord
Sutan is right We dont have any eyes on that location
 Where would we find something thats
handwritten
 Would that come from them you think
 Yeah we didnt really check to see if
they had signed any of them did they
 I was thinking do they have post here in
this city Someone that comes and picks up mail
Could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail
 What time is it
 Whats the exact time No Im just
kidding
 What the fuck are you talking about
 What if we divide our forces for now and
try to find that handwriting sample One of us
goes and looks for the post the other one tries
to find those public records
 Yeah she was kind of unpleasant
 Yeah she wasnt really about that fan
life
 Possibly but if we go by there we cant
be seen
 Or knock on the back door if such a thing
exists
 Is that how we want to find Lord Sutans
address
 That seems like a good idea
 So youre saying Ulog probably is in
trouble and is going to roll over on us in order
to get something taken off of him
 To Dolans then
 Yeah you said theres no back door
right Side windows anything like that
 Well it should be one of the three of us
because thats who theyll know
 Mmhmm
 Okay
 Yeah Im going to fucking change it up
Is there a little alley that I can pop into before
I head over to his place of residence
 Yeah I cast Disguise Self and I turn back
into that black cloak with gold trim the long
black hair
 Thats right
 Nice
 Yeah if you look like you
 We dont want to have them see us going
over there
 Cool All right
 Oh whats the sign
 A peacock
 Was that supposed to be a hawk A pigeon

 Fair enough its a pigeon A feral
pigeon
 If theres trouble
 All right
 I walk over to Dolans house
 Yes it is I bring word from the Mighty
Nein May I come in please
 Is there anyone in the room that I dont
see besides Horris and Dolan
 Ill drop the disguise
 I apologize We realize that after you
 I apologize

 After we finished speaking we realized we
werent aware of where Lord Sutan resided
 Great Will do Another thing that we
realized in our efforts to frame and forge
which are vast you dont happen to have any
handwriting from Lord Sutan do you
 There was nothing that ousted you from
your business any sort of receipt or
 Is there anyone else in the area that we
should know that he does business with that he
might communicate with regularly
 Theres a pen pal And finding out who the
pen pal is
 No theres no fucking pigeons
 Ren Sutan
 Thats who he wrote to though
 Its who he wrote to
 Well he sounds like a real son of a
bitch
 This Ren Sutan any idea where we might be
able to find him
 A physician also
 A dark physician most likely hmm
 Yeah rampant where Im from Just real
fucking dark
 Indeed I will Indeed
 You probably will not be hearing from us
again before the task is done
 No
 Was I supposed to say stuff about the
HighRichter
 Thank you We wont trouble you any
longer
 Song and Supper Inn
 Mmhmm
 Lock that door behind me and I leave
 Stupid pigeons
HighRichter
 Yeah but Im not sharing it Yep Got it
Got it no problem Read it looked at it I
understand what it looks like Lets go

 Nope sorry not going to help you
 A whole bunch of stuff but I cant say it
around them I just wont out of principle
 Now see if you ask nicely yeah things
will ha I walk back up to the door

 Knockknockknock
 One more thing
 Totally forgot to ask you dont happen to
have any handwriting from the HighRichter do you
 Yeah I know

 Great
 Have a good day
 No None
 Yeah Blah blah blah Rens address and
the address Now you got it
 Was that mentioned
 Oh okay yeah that Blah
 Were getting ahead of ourselves Lets
stay on task Lets head to the Gilded Willows
where in the TriSpire where the fucking
Scottsdale party What do these notes say
Skyskate Park and Constellation Boulevard
 Yeah that thing
 Yeah I was writing real fast
 Just recon Were trying to see what this
place looks like if we can see Lord Sutan Then
well make a decision if we go after his son or
not Who maybe has some of his handwriting
 Sure
 Handwriting
 And see if Rens a son of a bitch Yeah
 Yeah me too because I cant make it
through the gates
 Thats what I was wondering what you were
talking about
 Because shes got a cloak now
 Cool
 Caleb where you want to go buddy
 Wait theyre both Sutan
 Yeah you wont bring back Clarota or
nothing itll be great
 Cant be
 Should we meet back at the Song  Supper

  Remember 
  Hunters Mark

 Turn Undead 
 Youve never heard of safety in numbers

 Yeah man I just figured youd be a part
of this
 Just some simple reconnaissance See if we
can see Ren maybe have a conversation with him

hes got some of his dads handwriting
 Great were going to head towards the
Apple Tree Tuneship What did I write here
 Thank you

 I could kick the shit out of Nott in the
face and then like

to give him the chance to get out I think we
should do that Hes given us everything
 We removed his armor We should give him
something to leave in so hes not just walking
buck through the city
 No he just said hes going to kill us if
we dont give it to him
 Really
 Why dont we leave it up to him We untie
him he comes at us bros we take him down Were
giving him a chance at freedom
 He doesnt get the beacon
 Hell come after it I know

but Im not taking his life So if someone feels
motivated Ill just walk over this way And I
start walking back the way we came

 Beaus going to be coming around the back
make sure she gets let in
 Youre leaving
 Why
 Take a deep breath friend Listen Ulog
is dead He sacrificed himself in a very brave
moment He threw himself at the Richter threw a
gem in her mouth and exploded in a Fireball
Listen I think
 I think
 I dont think any of this leads back to
us We still have to complete our mission
We got to make sure that Lord Sutan is implicated in
this but right now were clean
 The Richters gone You have a chance to
ascend to her seat Wasnt that the plan
 Stop Dont be a coward in this moment If
you want to help this city if you want to help
make the empire better youre going to have to
stand strong A little risk is going to come with
this job especially in that position You knew
the risk going into this didnt you To put your
money and your lives at risk
 
 I understand Fortunately in this
situation you dont have much to lie about You
were here You werent at the Richters You
werent involved in it in any way The Knights of
Requital are going to take the fall for this that
would be the only tiein Ulog is dead
You have a chance to do some real good here
 Well keep an eye out I promise If
anything needs to be shared between you can rely
on us to pass a message
 Are you in the house yet
 Thats Beau
 You love him or you hate him
 Dolan I know Horris and you both are
worried Were still going to need that payment
Our efforts have incurred some damages
 Anywhere you prefer Is there a hiding
spot
 Fair enough We can do that
 Beau has experience with this area
 Im afraid Ulog may have had a larger game
to play
 Why do you say that Horris
 He left us in charge of finding justice
for his wife and we intend to
 Do I believe him
 
 All right Lets help Horris get out of
the city Stay low Stay here
 Have a drink Itll help with that
 Of course Well have to regroup and
well get back to you as soon as we can
 We leave
 Do I get anything from it You creepy
bastard
 We got a quesadilla
 Shady motherfuckers
 That cuteness man
 Who are that
 Not downstairs
 Convene in the girls room Its bound to
be cleaner
 Yeah where is Caleb
 Hes down there babysitting our item
 Okay
 Spinach
 Thats my bad Yeah he did
 Yeah we forgot to qualify that
 Yeah jeez man No sense of humor right
now hes in shock all right
 Horris were going to get you out of the
city as soon as possible Is there a destination
you wanted to send him to or point him in the
right direction
 Have any spots in mind that you can lay
low for a while
 They were understandably rattled Its
understandable but Dolans going to try and stay
to make the city a better place Horris is going
to remove a bit of the risk for himself for a bit
 It is lovely by the coast
 I think what Beau is trying to say is that
youve made a wise choice in removing yourself for
a bit Did you happen to know the owner of The
Leaky Tap Shes apparently selling it
 Shes selling it Yeah
 Did you want to get out of town tonight
or did you want to wait until the morning perhaps
 Not at all We have room in Molly and Is
room
 Yeah Ill lead Horris to our room and let
him get comfortable Ill be back
  Red rum
 Yeah youre going down there
 Wow fucking pay day
 What kind of sword is it
 Does it look like it has any magical aura
emanating from it
 Not officially
 CayCay not to be confused with Kiki
 What do those do
 Molly put those boots on
 You get an extra spring in your step
Whats it do
 Windowseal
 Windowseal
 Why are yall staying in another place
tonight
 Oh Because of the thing
 You need any help Backup
 Right
 Nott why Why are you going to
 Yeah to be honest that evening started
to take a turn before the Richter showed up Do
you know Caleb to be stickyfingered like
yourself
 Well remember we were trying to leave no
trace Caleb was the architect of the plan and
there was a scroll that looked like it might have
some magic to it and he wanted to take it with
 We were right there at the end we were at
the finish line
 Nott its just a little reckless
wouldnt you say
 Were looking out for you I mean
 You know Nott you count on Caleb to keep
you safe right to achieve greater things than
you by yourself can achieve Think how many things
you could do with all of us by your side Im not
saying you dont have to be selfish and Im not
saying that you cant go after treasure and coin
 Okay
 If I may thank you for sharing that
Nott
 That changes things I admit that I had
the wrong idea about you two I know what its
like to feel responsible for someone
 Nott we want to take care of Caleb we
do We pulled him out of that house when that
Fireball went off We didnt cut and run even
though it might have saved our skins We care
about you two I hope in time youll learn to
trust us just a little bit more Maybe think about
protecting us as well because you seem to do a
great job taking care of Caleb
 I appreciate that
 So when are you planning to go down to
keep an eye on your boy
 Nott how about you take those items to
Caleb and call it a vote of confidence
 I think hes got the point
 Are you fucking serious
 Natural one
 Im just eating bar popcorn
 Yeah
 What the fuck
 Nope youre not there
 Yes
 Just wait
 Pick up and walk
 I have to say it because Taliesin said it

 Dont die
 Oh okay A d right
 Seven
 Yeah really con modifier
 I just forget  points
 Im going to see Horris
 Horris do you need an escort out of town
or do you think you can find your way
 Of course Have much coin do you have on
you
 Oh youll be fine
 Molly Molly
 Wake up I think Im going to escort
Horris out Be back as fast as I can
 All right
 Stay casual stay calm just turn and
were going to slowly start walking back Just act normal
 There always is And if all else fails
theres the sewers Youre not opposed to getting
a little dirty to get out of town are you
 Well want to wait until we have more of
the others just in case Im afraid the sewers
might be being cased as well so stay put for a
little while longer well find you a quiet spot
in the Leaky Tap but let me check with the
others
 No we found Dolan last night Hes going
to stay put in his house low Were going to try
and assure that hes safe so that he can you
know put his name up for that HighRichter seat
 But listen the gates its not a joke
its sealed There are crownsguard swarming all
over it It seemed like they were doing personal
interviews patdowns the whole smash so even an
enchantment might not hold up to scrutiny
 We didnt see her last night She wasnt
at Dolans
 Well she saw Yes she did
 Yeah
 Perhaps
 Indeed I was thinking that we might try
and get Horris out now That way if a crownsguard
finds its way here maybe we should take him into
the sewers get him out of the city
 I imagine
 Indeed
 I did too
SAM And also theres the Gentleman and also we
need a lead box Oh my God theres so much to do
 Horris we obviously have a lot to decide
on Perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in
the room
 Very sweet person
 Level four lets go

  You are leaving the
combat area
 Chats like Fucking idiots
 The Leaky Nip Whats it called
 Pumats got to have a
 Have we been there yet
 I rolled a natural 
 I know magic some
 Not enough DM says
 Have you not been to the Invulnerable
Gentleclerk
 

 To be fair he did say that
 Pumat or the rest of the equipment
 Lets do it
 Hes pretty nice
 He seems like a nice guy
 Plus were returning customers
 Attacking us
 I think if you give him a chance hell do
you right
 Pumat wed like to introduce you to one
of our friends This is Beau
 Pumat we came into a little extra coin
recently and this is our favorite place to spend
You dont happen to have any articles of
protection do you A necklace a bracelet a ring
 It was expensive right
 That sounds fine
 Heres ten platinum
 Well should we go
 Oh were looking up something
 Forgive me I couldnt help but wonder
Have you ever had a chance Pumat Prime rather
have you had a chance to exercise your arcane
abilities
 Yeah if you wouldnt mind
 These are all Whats the correct term
 Theyre all copies of this fine gentleman
Pumat I wanted to ask were such fans of your
store did you ever find call to I dont know
use your magic for combat What led you to a store
like this
 Thats great How many years have you had
this store
 Congratulations Its really a thing
 Shake it out of the corners of the giant
flask
 Thanks for your time Pumat
 Hes actually still here
 I would like it
 Lets get that thing in its box
 Are you fucking kidding me
 Oh my god
 Bestseller or used book
 Pumat thanks for your time We will not
be bothering you any longer
 We double dash back to the Tap
 No
 Why
  Plus four
 Yeah I say that
 It seems like a different sort of arcana
than the type that Ive seen
 What else we got
 Thats pretty dope
 Pretty dope
 Although that greatsword she has is
mighty fine
 Yeah certainly I just have a preference with
mine Im just real comfortable with it You know
when you get a feel for something you dont want
to change it up too much
 Bigass tall Doc Martens
 My initiative bonus is zero just saying
 No you keep them
  Just smile and say Thank
you Nott
  Very good
 So we should ugh just look at them
 We should probably do something We still
have to wrap up this deception of ours
 You sound like The General car insurance
 Yeah I think thats right actually I
forgot that part
 Did we plant something in Lord Sutans
house are they going to find the letter from
 We did
 I dont know if he would report a robbery
if he had a Rug of Attacking and you triggered it
 We could certainly go by
 Oh shit I forgot
 Thats right
 We got paid already How much did I get
paid Because it was minus Karas
 I did
 Mmhmm
 I dont know if theyll send anything back
on Dolan but we should find a way to get
crownsguard into Lord Sutans place
 We cant have Dolan rat on him Hmm
 Lets try that
 Yeah Lets try that
 Yeah we fucking follow him into the
room
 Yep
  Insight check Insight check on
Taliesin Insight check
 Look at Taliesin right now Just look at
him
 I didnt say anything
  Fucking insight check on
Taliesin No Im kidding
 If we had to ballpark it how many persons
would you say are in this
 I dont mind rolling with this name
Lucien but does it bring any extra trouble with it
 Fair enough
 All right
 Not a chance I didnt catch that at all
 Lucien Nonagon
 Wow
 This is all well and good and kind of
fucking boring I couldnt help but notice that
surlylooking crew up there who might that be
 Humbly we are members of The Mighty
Nein
 Well we sought an audience and to be
frank we thought we might find a little bit more
of a warm reception than the one that were
currently getting
 Oh of course easily understood
 We mean to make ourselves of service
whether it be for the good of the city or other
endeavors Were new here We thought we would try
to make as many introductions and have as many
meetings happen as we could
 Oh Im sure wed be all ears
 Oh of course and forgive my ignorance
This would be used to locate us Is that what this
is for
 Yeah fuck it
 How did you do that
 Right
  Dont like it do you
 Yeah
 Three to go One two three
 Yes Id say I am
 Are you writing that down
 Shit Wheres the fucking luck of Jester
 I could as well
 All right I feel lucky

 Fjord
 No Now I do
 Ooh get em
 My goodness this is getting expensive
quite fast

 Mmhmm
 You first
 Funny how that works No Im good where I

 Sounds good  it is
 What were not going to bet again

 Lets make it 
  Thats all the money I have
  So 
 I can do math
 A seven a five and a three

 Thank you Nice hand
 Very versatile Id have to say though
Balanced
 Nott I think
 Yeah
 This is most intriguing I hope we would
be able to interview your previous compatriots
Wed like to know what they saw before what we
might expect
 To clear our name here in Zadash
 Youre going to kill The Gentleman
 Sir I couldnt help but hear that this is
about a mile outside of the city Is that correct
 Are you operating on any sort of a
timeline Might we have a little bit of lenience
with how quickly we get this dealt with
 Ive just had a thought actually if you
could help us at the same time were trying to
get a friend of ours out of the city And 
recent events seem to have clogged up most entries
and exits We have a friend Horris that needs to
find his way to a safe spot
 Indeed
 Discretion is appreciated
 Figured you might
 Outstanding I think we have a deal do we
not
 Outstanding
 Fantastic Nott pace yourself now you
hear
 Is that goliath wielding any sort of
visible weapon
 Ogre and the goliath mauls each Fuck
 Oh yeah they were armored behind us
 That group looks like your type Feel like
making friends
 I would love to
 What do you expect to see there T
 Yeah I was going to say the same thing
 Let me get this straight A bunch of
fucking floating lights came out of the wall gave
your boy a little static shock and you ran
 Yeah Well theyre calling in the big
leaguers now so well take it from here Your way
up and down those stairs you mentioned you get
tripped up along the way or was it just easy sailing
 What about it was ominous
 Yeah Scared of school
 Yeah Old terrors
 I appreciate your passion I dont think
youre in great favor in this room at the moment
You see that really tall woman over there with
that big greatsword on her back She doesnt
appreciate when people talk to us like that
 
 No  Sorry
 My shag armor
 Did you three have a name
 Dont be ashamed if you dont
 Dont worry Well clean it up for you
Enjoy your drinks Going to join the others
 Deception check
 Of course
 Yeah Good thing I won huh
 Am I rolling in it
 Oh No I was actually only gambling my
funds
 Yeah
 Are you
 At the moment
 Im telling the truth I hadnt even divvied
up that amount from Dolan and everybody else
 Good to know Calculated risks Ill keep
that in mind I thought you liked to play things
close to the chest
 Sometimes you got to get a little stupid
though
 No thats not it either
 Can you change that alcohol into wine
 Its alcohol one way or the other Ill
fucking drink
 Molly Excuse me Lucien
 How many others around here might we
expect to have that same reaction towards you
 Yeah
 Youre not afraid of inclement weather or
anything are you Itd been real fair that
storm rolled in and poof you were fucking gone
 Did you handle what you needed to handle
 I make sure Notts drink is full all the
time

 Can I look around this unsavory place
There are no faces that I recognize right
 I think Karas the way to go We start
asking him questions about something that big
maybe he wont like us poking our nose around
 When shit happened
 No There was a bit of a beatdown the
other night in the TriSpire One of the towers
was attacked
 Oh Yashaing
 You want to go talk to Kara before we get
out of here
 They came in trying to steal this Beacon
this glowing beacon which we still have but they
were mighty upset about it
 Why Lucien You afraid the Myriad will
hear Whats his reaction
 Do I believe him
 Shit 
 Whats that saying Be careful of the toes
you step on they might belong to the ass you got
to kiss later
 The attack on the tower
 I was looking at you
 Still need a whisper corner
 Im going to ask you a question youre 
probably not going to give me the truth to Is your
relationship with the Gentleman one of a debt or
one of convenience
 I hear that
 I only have one other thing I was taken
by Dolans passionate message
 All right Is some of the business that we
can expect going to go against the fair people of
this city
 Indeed Thats a connection worth the
trouble
 You got a nice face
 Im glad you found a place here It was
good to see you again
 If I cant tell you didnt
 Leave that one alone
 We head downstairs
 Oh yeah the one that we had for
 Yeah Like sprinkles and hard candies
Just 
  Her skirts like 
  Im on the couch tonight

 Its wafting over
 Lucien
 Greatsword
 Yeah I think its got some potential Do
you mind if I hold on to it for a bit
 Nott why dont you ask that big ogre by
the door what her name is
 You have such a way with people
 Yeah you knock down the barriers you get
right in Icebreaker
 No thats not true at all
 Always good to make friends with the
doorman You got to know this
 Tell him that joke you know
 Character choice
 Come on
 Oh no
 Kutha
 What is it

 We should go
 We go up the stairs and out
 Kuthag Or Kuth
 And we have an amazing community member
and Critter who has graciously offered to match
all donations up to  That means each
dollar that you donate will be doubled
 Theyre getting worse
 I feel like I should divvy up that gold
that I didnt hand out earlier
 Yeah Ill have to remember
 Ill have to remember to do that some
other day
 Oh right Does Jester have that
 I guess we should let Horris know that
hell get an escort out of town right
 Lets do it
 Yeah right
 It went well I think we found suitable
passage for you out of this city Needless to say
without involving you too much were going to
have someone take you out a secret entrance and
make sure youre safe on your way out
 Yeah I guess it was
 I didnt write down how much fucking gold
didnt I 
 Any favorite parts
 Hate those Pictures good
 What the fuck are you reading it for
then
 Yeah sorry Listen everybody gets 
gold
 Yep and three silver
 No not you
 Three silver
 So did we all
 Cereal for dinner
 Well I assume theyll come for you
sometime in the night or in the morning Hope you
wont mind if we dont wait We traded your
expedited journey out of the city in order for us
to go and take care of some bit of business for
them
 We didnt really ask did we
 Oh
 No I think thats probably right
 Either that or theyll kill him fake
laugh
 True
 Maybe just before we go in Anything we
want to do before we go out on this errand
 Yeah theyre boobytrapped
 Sounds like a retirement home The Shady
Pear

 So before you woke up in the dirt

 I remember they said they threw an
explosive behind them and dropped even more so
this wont be the first rock slide
 Well lets get in there
 Wait were in the spiral staircase and it
goes
 We cant see around the bend to how far
down it goes right Is it an open spiral
staircase or just a wall
 We can only see as far up as the curves go
in either direction
 Unless it lets people know when something
crosses in front of it
 Were going to head downwards
 Yeah please
 Im right in the middle
 Where do you want to be
 Thats cocked as hell
 Why are you cupping the balls under your
mouth
 Ah Im running
 Yeah just things to shoot you in the
fucking legs

edge is pointing towards us The flat or the point

  Going to have to get back to
you Perception intimidation investigation
 
 Oh shit
 So I dont know why I know this

 It feels like the triangle is down here
 Is anyone on the platform
 Fuck it Ill stand up on the platform
 Can I look down into that black hole in
the center of it
 I have darkvision Oh yeah Ill take the
torch
 I will put my finger in the hole
actually I dont know how big the hole is but I
want to feel if there are any grooves on the
inside or any sort of indentations
 I put my little pinkie in it
 Solid walls
 Well its short There anything around
here that looks like a staff or a pole or rod
 The floor around this triangle shape its
flush in the ground right Theres no circle
around the triangle platform
 So the grounds not going to move Maybe
the ceiling has to move
 Right Were not going to be able to turn
the floor
 Caleb do you have anything to draw these
symbols
 Oh yeah Jester please both of you
yeah Just to get a rendition of the ceiling in
relation to the ground
 I think maybe we need to see where those
stairs go up
 Wait Youre going to wait until she
disarms the
 Redemption is fucking painful
 You want a toe I can get you a toe
 Ten feet ahead is fine
 Yeah we start heading up with Frumpkin
ten feet in front
 Everybody
 Is there any sort of door at the top of
the stairs that leads into this chamber or is it
just open
 Im walking in
 No Lets see whats on the other side of
the room first
 Cool I start walking towards the other
side of the room
 The little metallic glimmer that we saw
Can we see
 About a half inch in diameter would you
call it
 These are trash urns
 Can I try and move some of the rubble off
of the bronze rod
 Okay I think thats a 
 Does it wobble
 Does it make any noise
 If I swing it harder does it
 
 I got a question You said ten minutes on
the boat as we were moving forward ten minutes
for him to cast detect magic and another ten
minutes for detect magic to run out so its been
about a half an hour
 Okay great So my Armor of Agathys is
still up

wispy thing right next to me

 Great Can I take swipe at it with
the Wastehunter Blade
 Wastehunter That is  to hit
 Wow Can I use all of my  foot walking
speed to run towards the door there where we came
out of
 That is the plan here
 It hits
 And it take ten points of cold damage
 Beautiful
 Ive got that gold rod by the way Im
getting the fuck out of here
 Which means you roll with advantage but
they get advantage on you
 Plus half your barbarian level
 Nice dude nice
 Ugh its in my eyebrows
 TheMostJost
 No I dont think so either Theyre
fucking ceramic pottery pieces
 We should rest right now
 Were still resting
 Are the eye holes about the size of gold
coins

both of the eyes on one of the faces
 Ill do that to the other two eyes in the
other face

weapons or objects

resistance to necrotic damage for one hour Nice

 Oh yeah Give him a shot
 Were hoping that well get it to turn
 I refuse your command and I give it to
Schmidt willingly
 Counterclockwise
 Rocking upstairs
 Yeah okay Ill walk up and Ill grab the
rod
 It doesnt move
 Do we think we need to cast unique spells
into those bowls for each of the three schools of
magic Which is what Jester said
 Im trying to figure out how do you cast
necrotic damage on a bowl
 You want to Inflict Wounds on one of
them
 Other two Or maybe not
 Did we pick the form of our killer
 I think so
 Seven
 Number five tonight
 Great
 Zero speed or slow speed
 So its zero speed it doesnt go
anywhere
 Is this considered a monstrosity
 An ooze
 There is something in it

 Im going to use my speed to run on this
side of the cube closer to you as far back
against that wall as possible

deliver people or things This was a center for transportation
 Real bright

 Suddenly Im scared of falling on the
beach
 Natural
 Yeah you can
 Yay Thats seven
 What about that cloak
 Can I come up and see if it has any magic
feel to it
 
 Weird Looks like its been burned a bit
Its got a little compartment in the front
 I dont know
 You want to try it on
 There was that one book on the desk
 This is one of the ones in the cages
right
 Hey Yasha you feel like knocking the shit
out of some of those cages opening them up
 Can I walk to the entrance to the tunnel
just to keep an eye out while he does his thing
 
 Thats very considerate of you Nott
 Not a good sword
 Oh shit If theyre casting something it
breaks it
 If they had like a Hold Person up it
could dispel it
 
 I dont mind
 Hes redacting his own card
 The idiot goliath kept it for five years
 Are you sure its not on the table
 Anything else in the hallway moving
 Yeah just to clear it out
 Plus if you give them all the rings they
might give us a job with more fancy stuff next time
 Its pretty obvious youre going to have
to hide it if we walk back in there
 No I dont think we do
 Yeah We didnt see any other exits
right
 Which is weird because it was all caved
in
 Can you mend the transportation circle
 I will make one too but Im not going to
count it
 I rolled it but
 A 
 I feel like I remember something about a
real larvalooking worm Huge fucking thing
front
 Yeah Locked away after the Calamity but
real nasty
 Not really its more like I remember from
a dream or something Kind of hard to remember if
it happened to me or not
 No I dont think so Could be
 How do you do that
 As per usual
 Yeah what are they made of Can we tell
what kind of metal those candlesticks are made of
 Fuck yeah man Melt that down
 Natural one
 Pretty sure its aluminum
 I forgot we got that
 We should probably get back Weve been
here awhile
 Well we almost were
 We head out
 No problem
 Current goes away from the direction we
came from
 We could see whats down the river a bit
 Were already out this far Might as well
see where it goes for a little bit
 Sure We could do that
 Well be back Were just taking a little
look
 Keep an eye on the roof remember
 We could check out the other cavern and
save the deeper part of the river for when were together
 Yeah were fighting up
 I get behind Jester and start massaging
her traps
 Is there land off to the sides of the
bottom of the waterfall
 Im not letting him go by himself I do
the same thing
 Darkvision Do I see anything
 Thats bad luck
 No scratches in the walls or any pouches
or compartments on the floor around this little space
 Natural 
 What do those manacles look like
 Oh we could use those Ill walk over and
I step on the elbow joint and snap it
 Yep put the manacles over and Ill jump
back in
 Yeah thats what I was going to say
 Can I aid him or help him do something
 Jester give me a hand
 I am  easy okay
 I think were good to go back and join the
others yeah
 We should actually go back inside and use
the entrance as a good funnel Dont leave
ourselves in the open
 Yeah it is
 Yeah the top or the bottom The
bottom
 Yeah because the bottom one with the
things the traps blockers
 You dont know that
 Take your time Its all good
 Oh no Oh god
 Consume Oh god am I going to try to
swallow the sword
 Its a large blade right
 I dont know what you mean consume Fuck
it Ill turn the blade over and keeping my eyes
on the big eye Ill bring it up to my mouth and
open it
 Ill
 Anything in my hands
 I wipe my mouth
 Can I try and summon the sword
 I try and keep my  Fu
Make it disappear again Has anybody woken up Are
any eyes open at all
 Ill lay back down and go to sleep
 Holy shit
 Oh you crazy motherfucker
 Wow good call back
 Standard deviation
  What is Greek

 Oh yeah I fucking grind my teeth
 No no nope Just bit myself in my sleep
thats all
 Thank you Jester I appreciate
 Yup I pull down my lower lip
 You see very short nubby teeth with
scratches and divots and chips on the top
 Just on the
 Yeah I did
 That would have been a better excuse When
I was younger they used to make fun of my teeth
 Kids can be cruel so I decided to take
away the target that was most easily available for them
 Yeah at the time there werent any others
like me I feel like I was especially picked on
for my teeth
 Not necessarily It became a habit
 Im sure I dont have to Its like people
who chew their nails I guess
 They are persistent
 Not super fast
 No I think I bit my lip
 Yeah right and then you bite it again
the next day
 Bod mod No I did not
 No I didnt have that sort of a streak in
me then
 I was a bit tougher than most of the other
kids I felt like I could take the physical
poking but the jeering I
 You know its not even really that
intentional Ill find myself picking at them
every once in a while
 Like to grow back
 Yeah there are times Ive seen them

other half orcs with the teeth
 He did yeah I feel like its a trait
that exemplifies the rougher side of my race so
sometimes I wish I had them and sometimes Im
glad I dont
 I think its how Id like to see myself
 You saying I should let them grow out
 All right fair How about you see me
picking at them or chipping at them or any of
that shit you just say the word and Ill stop
 Yeah Eyes on the ceiling as well because
thats where danger came from
 Hey thats way better Thank you A 
 Boat rowers
 
 Yeah it was not really much of a test for
us
 Thats true
 Can we just forego those I feel like
this is going to be the beginning of a very
fruitful relationship surely
 Right up the butt
 Apologies for our poor timing Hopefully
we werent interrupting
 Really not that big of a deal There were
some willowisps some floating spirits
 There was actually yes
 Indeed
 Good thing you sent the pros Amateurs
probably would have had a worse time
 You are not Scanlan anymore

 There was a fair amount of jewelry There
was
 Look we know who has them We know
 There was a destroyed looks like a
transportation circle inside
 Bodies Lots of bodies
 A lot of bodies
 Four because there were two pairs

Well be in touch shall we
 He can follow us Thats fine
 Thats right You sure you dont want to
sell off any of your extra wares
 Sure
 Put him at ease
 Oh Yeah of course Head back that way
 I think he was trying to upset the
government right Create fractures hope pressure
would make things snap in the end
 Maybe hes been hedging his bets for a
while Good to keep in mind
 Id normally but I feel like he knows
you
 Walk up Double tap followed by a
single
 Safe

 You want a health potion
 You want a health potion

 Because you got stabbed with poopteeth
 Yeah fucking take it
 Did it look like they prepared anything
with fire before the creature came out
 They used cover really well We should try
and hide ourselves better
 Nott had a great idea actually though We
should keep our distance
 We dont
 You people that need to be up close just
wait until it gets to you Make him chase you for
a bit Use the cover Lets put some damage on it
before
 Jester and Molly
 Oh no No that isnt me either
 Six

 Round two
 Oh fuck me Oh god
 Oh
 
 Ooh

 Im going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself and Im going to use my bonus action to
cast Hex on the wolf thats nearest to Yasha and
give it disadvantage on dexterity checks Im
going to use my movement to run towards that
wolf
 Mmhmm
 In between Molly and Yasha
 Stay out of the cone get on the
backside
 Huge
 With my bonus action can I transfer my
Hex onto this wolf and can I start running around
to get to its right hindquarter Staying in melee
but getting on its rear

here that wont make it past
 All right if thats what you guys want to
do
 Ill go take one of the doors
 For the record I do not like this plan
 You should get some distance
 Any ideas
 The idea is that whatever doors they come
out of will get one surprise round and
then whoevers by those doors better be able to
take some damage
 You dont want to be near me You should
be in the middle able to move
 Yeah there are four doors right
 I dont know if the map is accurate to how
many doors there are
 Fuck that no no no weve got to get in
the middle This is a terrible plan
 Theres too many doors
 Theres those four others besides the one
we came in
 No no we got to come in the center we
got to take advantage of the sentinels
 Thats the point of the feat Were spread
way too fucking thin
 Go back in the middle like we thought we
were going to do
  My door my door
 Two spines in the side
 Oh my God

pockets and do the city some good
 Well were frequently at the what the
name was the

way up through this thing

 You just got this
 Third level is like d
 With this flash of action I mask my voice
 Shes cracking it out
 I walk over to the other side of the crowd
bandages Trying to whip up a betting frenzy
 On who
 Talking super fast All coked up
 Nah were walking out of this city
miles
 Thats us Always down for a scrap
 Of course It didnt seem like our options
above ground were all that plentiful We were more
than anxious to hear what you might offer
 Oh
 Indeed I assume it doesnt mean
overthrowing it
More manipulating it to your
individual gain
 Yes
 A tantalizing offer You said you had
others
 Could you describe your friend Vabron
 No grill busted eye Okay
 Would we have the same sort of timetable
for this mission a month
 Anything else
 Well perhaps well partake of some
beverages and discuss
 Anime sparkles
 Your one busted eye is wandering
 Well learn him its all right
 Give us some time to discuss and well
get back to you shortly
 Is there an open booth or
 Yeah the darkest corner
 Well what do you think
 Shadycreek Run
 You have no preference
 Any preference to water versus perhaps
an abundance of dry ground
 Plus if this is as aggressive as they say
it is an attack on the border Im sure that
legionnaires job will be there when we return
anyway Price might have increased
 Better to bet on the underbelly rising up
than the top maintaining what it has
 Remind me whats in Hupperdook
 Hupperdook
 Okay definitely stopping in Hupperdook
 So were going to take that shady
underground river out
 Turned on
 Are you crushing on him
 How many of us are uncomfortable hearing
that word
 Yeah its gone dark right So either
remove whatevers in there and get it back up and
running again
 Thats a pretty good printer
 Why
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah weve held up our part of the
bargain
 Yeah if hes there I just dont want to
go out of our way looking for him and all of a
sudden have the guilt of you know
 I mean dont get me wrong I like our
efforts here in the city I think weve done good
 Hard to keep track of parties outside of
our purview
 Yeah Just over it huh Plus itll give
us time to leave Maybe things will change by the
time we come back Or maybe not Well see Never
know what happens outside
 Oh really
 Youre more nomadic
 Okay
 Lets do it yeah Well pound our drinks
keep them away from Beau because
shell drink all of them
 All right
 Well leave Molly and Jester here to nurse
their drinks and their short rests and well go
back up and speak to the Gentleman No
 Yeah Anybody thats not nursing a short
rest
 Is Sorad the female goliath
 Sorah Is she present in the tavern at the
moment
 Nice I will approach
 Indeed We have good news We have decided
to take you up on your offer
 The Lebenda Swamp
 The Lebenda Swamp is what weve decided
to take you up on
 Oh I thought we were doing the beginners
course
 Oh were doing both
 Apparently our ambition has no limit Both
it is

 Fucking
 By water or also on foot
 Do we still have the cart and the two
horses
 Were unfortunately a little short on
transportation We could use a few horses
 Outstanding Jester did have an excellent
question Well need certain remedies especially
near the water Anything that you can provide that
might put us in an advantageous position would be
most appreciated
 Do you know what is also as valuable as
resources is knowledge In this swamp area are
there any particular hazards that we should keep
an eye out for that your men have seen repetitively
 I wouldnt presume to be as lucky as to
have Louis have tried this mission before and
fucked it up as well has he
 Hey Louis Fuck you
 Yep hes a winner
 Swamp pun
 Fucking shit
 This is very exciting two missions at
once
 Well its still a really good time in the
day we should go ahead and make preparations Make
our way back up
 As we pass that big ogre on the way out I
 Thats a big hand
 Fucking Kutha cant catch a break
 I mean we can head over to the cart and
horses
 More
 Okay theres nothing there
 But you can finally kill him if you want
to

 As you run off I say
 Meet us at the cart
and horses
 I do
 Whos riding on the cart first
 Yeah we got like five horses and a cart
Two horses pulling the cart Or two and three solos
 How many horses do we have
 Okay Two horses pulling the cart and
four solos
 Who else wants to be on the cart
 Okay
 What
 Thats right sorry Ill take a horse as
well
 Keep that demon cat away from me El gato
es el diablo all right
 The Feywild Is it like another city
 One thing at a time
 Whats it sound like
 Only rats that they ate
 Pure death Fucking anaphylactic shock
 I guess Ill take the lead and well make
our way out the city Heading northeast right
 To the Bronchial Byway
 I think well go at a regular pace until
we get to the Bromkiln Byway At the Amber Road
we should be all right
 Are there any tree clusters or rock
clusters or boulders or anything that provides shelter
 Im the wrong person to be doing this
 Ill aid you
 Just off the road is fine At this point
Id like to see the road as well That way we can
see anyone coming
 I have a torch as well
 Ill throw in two Molly
 Ill take first watch
 My perceptions shit Hows yours

 Yep
 That was such church youth trip flirting
 Because its night
 Like when you get a sunburn and you wake
up and theyre fucking sticking to you and stuff
It sucks
 Youve got to rip them off just one big
one
 Is she telling the truth Do I feel like
shes telling the truth
 Shit
 You and your brothers and sisters Or you
and your children or parents
 Oh But youre not super tight with them
 No favorite brother or sister or playmate
or
 Do you fight any urges when you see a
small child walking through the city to go up
and I dont know I dont mean any disrespect
but to snatch it
 Yeah no Im being honest Because if I
know theres a little kid running around and if
youre fucking tracing the damn thing I want to
know that I can put a hand out
 Just checking I havent met many that do
so pardon my you know
 In your belly
 All Fjord sees is a little kids hand
like chewing on a little kids hand
 So theres fire So what

bargaining with or something

the side of the neck and stick in before it falls

a constitution saving throw
 
 What does a foot sphere look like on the
map Four squares

was alarmed
 Fair enough
 Thats actually a very good point
 Carefully then
 Is Caleb blushing at all
 All right saddle up them dogies

 Medium A five
 Still rolling grasslands or are there
trees off to the side
 Vehicles in water
 Im pretty sure I saw carpenters tools
and I was like who needs that
 I think were going to need to double up
on these horses you guys Or at least unhitch
them from the wagon
 In our direction
 Ill use Disguise Self and Ill turn
myself into a crownsguard
 Im escorting you to the Labenda Swamp
Right To retrieve stuff for the crown For
Zadash
 You should move the safe
 Yeah Yasha and Jester should take the
safe
 Labenda
 Like Zsasz from the Batman comics
 Fuck you horse
 Bunch of little things Can we ask you
are you familiar with the Labenda Swamp
 Seems the same as what he just said
were not quite sure what to expect Any tales or
stories you can share
  Stop smiling
Anything else but that
 Thats very handy Jester
 Lets see if we can find a rise on one of
these hills to camp on the top
 No very peaceful actually
 No
 Yeah I could see how that would appear
that way
 More that It hasnt happened that
frequently
 Yeah but not yet If it does Ill let
you know
 Its only happened a couple of times
honestly
 Well yeah just the once actually
 I dont abide by the rules I walk my own
path Like a twister I was born to walk alone
 Fuck the rules Give me saline or give me
death
 Lets set it up
 Ill take first
 Were at the top of a rise so we can see
really well
 I dont mind rain
 I have an idea lets carve the bellies
out of the horses and we climb inside
 Yeah
 Were going to get wet
 Even then the grounds going to get
 I think the storms going to wake you up
soon enough
 These are not explosions orange or red
 Hmm I think we just need to hunker down
 Im staying up I like the rain
 Not a little one Dont gamble on those
 Which was Molly and I next one is Caleb
and Jester
 Did she go back to New York
 Okay good
 Is it water or blood that were covered
in
 Third watch is going to be either Yasha

lightning strikes or anything crazy
 There was
 Did you see it
 Thats so rare
 Thats ama I mean right Lightning

pieces of wood and put it in my little component
pouch
 Thats what Ive heard
 Ive only seen it hitting the water and
its just 
 Yeah
 Destroy the cart
 Fuck
 Yeah
 Yeah Ive never heard of anything like
that
 If you can Caleb that would be quite
remarkable
 Well listen nothing gets the blood warmed
like movement so perhaps we should pick up and
get going
 Wooden wheel cart
 Youre making cocktails
 That fucking movie traumatized me
 Were going to see a safe house that the
lights have been out at
 Okay thats what we decided to do
 Nope
 Now that weve continued on how do the
wagon wheels look on the road as were moving Are
they leaving tracks thats filling in with water
behind us at this point
 Not like the staff push though
 No movement that we can see just the
sound
 Branch canopies over us at this point

tree booger in it

and get the boog out of her eye
 Natural

 feet away above the water just above the
surface of it Im going to create a little
hummingbird and have it whip back and forth above

epic proportions
 Fucking Kentucky knows what Im talking
about
 Were in it
 You cant burp and then try to blame the
smell on somebody else
 Ill keep an eye out
 Lets do two separate rolls
 
 Kiri have you happened to see a safe
house or a building or a structure around while
you were fleeing
 The way we came from We could always give
her a horse
 Fearsome
 I reach behind my belt and pull out a
dagger and twirl it in my fingers and hand it
hilt towards Kiri Careful its sharp
 Its okay Kiri
 What good will it do I dont think that
we need to tell her
 Fair chance is better than none
 We should get back to the cart and at
least try to make our way into some drier
 All right to the cart then
 Yeah Molly and I take the lead on the horses
 Keystone Pub right
 From what we can see in the streets is
anyone carrying any weapons or guards or spears
 Keep pushing in looking for any signage
of the Keystone Pub
 
 When youre good and ready
 Let him know
 Two teeth busted eye
 Boulderparchmentshears
 Did you own the previous bar that this
ones built on top of
 You know we love traveling around Is
there anything in Berleben that we just have to
see before we leave
 Here
 Great
 Worse ways to go
 I walk away from the bar and stand near
the door entrance
 Yes
 True He did not have the kindest things
to say about you
 Ill give you 
 Yeah
 He aint going to fucking be here in the
morning
 Whos taking Kiri
 Okay
 Molly and Fjord
 Got some nuts on you there
 Smart
 Is there any moisture in the corners of
the room
 Which one is ours
 I really dont mind This is actually
pretty familiar
 Not a problem
 She writes at like font 
 Yeah and each page has like  words in
it
 Thats a lot of fucking energy this early
in the morning God 
 Do you have to go and kill it first
 Yeah What are we going to do until then
 I mean should we explore the street that
were on I mean weve got a long wait time
 They took the cart
 The old movie theater grab
 If you dont mind us asking why are you
heading into the swamp yourself
 Repeats stuff yeah
 Yes Yep Mmhmm
 Are you getting paid for this item
retrieval
 Yeah
make sure it doesnt get into the wrong hands
 What have you been doing after school
Honey
 Very open yeah Were like best friends
 So youre searching for a bowl
 And used in rituals
doesnt fall into the wrong hands thats all
 Our business might be headed out that way
a little later today Does she have any weapons on
her that are visible
 Not me
 Yes Thats okay 
 Do you think theyre sending people to get
it there before you
nice
 Oh good for us
 Is that code for something
 And you have a reason to believe that they
are expeditiously heading towards this bowl as well
now yes
 Listen we are kind of heading in that
direction
dont mind me coming I could use the help The
swamp Ive tried to go out in it by myself and
theres something out there
 Yes I understand that completely You and
I were going to be real close I can feel
 I know they can tell
 No Im allergic
 Although I dont think were going to have
time for that If youre going to join us youre
going to have to work for your food you
understand
 My names Fjord by the way
 I understand Unfortunately my daughter
is very particular about shiny and expensive
things so if this bowl has any worth Im afraid
we might need to be compensated for our troubles
Did you happen to bring any coin with you
something for it but Id like to keep it on me
for now if you dont mind Its a small trinket
Its got a little bit of magic but its just
that you can see on her human arm its a silver
bracelet with a charm token hanging off it with a
green emerald
 We normally have a no stranger policy but
well keep a close eye on you If you get up to
any tricksy business
 I hear you talking still Yeah Yasha and
Molly theyll remove your head for you You
understand
 Should we have her sign something I mean
should we have a release form
 Good youre in
 Well well see how we are at the end of
the day Bet thatll fix itself
 Youre overthinking it Caleb
 Febron any suggestions whether to move
through the muck fine land or through the trees
 The where
 Well leave it itll be fine daughter
 No Youve been naughty No
 And gets eaten
 Jesters regret
 I think you tell kids to run with
scissors shell be fine Can we check to make
sure nobodys following us as were heading out
 Plus four 
 Good pull
implement or something
 Deep pull already That was like 
minutes ago
guessing she knows what
 No please lead on Were quite anxious to
get there
 Fine Ill take the lead who wants to
join me
 Thank you both dont fight
 What are you talking about
 I honestly dont have an answer for that
okay
 You said it right its Ford
 Oh Jesus Kiri All right lets go
 All right Youre actually going to be
scouting right
 Three out of five
 Beau
 Right front
 Its really reassuring when theres a
question mark on the end of your statement
 Are you still drunk
 Oh jeez
 
 Can we see a source where it came from A
plant or a
 I think that doesnt look very
hospitable
 Yeah
burn it all away
 Cali that is a very good idea
from
 I mean hoping the pollens not flammable
but sure try it
 Caleb
 Ill give it a whirl Ill reach up near
my eye and you see this little arc of energy pop
out from my eye towards my hand Ill throw it
forward and cast Witch Bolt
 Oh thank you yeah Ten plus six 
 Okay great This is overkill its d
 Thats nine
  points of damage
 No it was a really encouraging display I
was not expecting it to be so durable
plant
 Not anymore with these rolls
 I actually tend to agree I dont want to
leave things undiscovered
 Are you
 Surf pro
  Oh yeah
 Super inviting Just all the tendons
 
 Did you hear anything snoring
 Jester bones arent normally a very good
sign
 You didnt happen to see a bowl did you
 Very wise
 Do you think well be able to find our way
back here Should we mark a tree or something like that
 Which ways your ass
 Fair enough
 Lead on
 You did a good job the first time lets
take it up again
 I think our speed is halved in the
conditions right
 Doing the slomo game
 Which is really not losing much at this
point
 Maybe we try to outmaneuver this one now
 Ooh  plus one 
 Hold I saw movement Off to our side 
to  feet into the trees
 Fan out a little bit
 Yeah fan out Who wants to move towards
it with me
 Yasha Molly Cali and Fjord Well walk
towards it
 But fan out not together Maybe ten 
feet in between us Like a fire line
 But fanned fire line
 Is it moving fast easily in this
terrain
  Do not see me
 Toucan With a belly
 Shh Jester
 Well keep moving around the edge of the
lake Who wants to keep an eye on his area as
were moving
 Jester and Molly you keep an eye as we
keep moving forward Well come back to where the
casters are
 No theyre going to stay with us in a
tight group But theyre going to keep their eyes
as we move
after us
 Mind your slice of the pie all right you
guys Youre a fan of pie so
 Heard of something like that around here
 Yeah I dont know if thats going to work
for me All right lets get moving Try and
ignore this
 Well give him a chance whether he engages
or not
 No stealth
 Maybe a little faster than our regular
too
sneaking off like that and finding it out
 Some people
me I can tell You know I mentioned those folks
in the dragon masks the cult They were the ones
that raised me
 I saw it What do you want to do
 Not too far
 Or we could just keep letting him match
 We could or Jester youre pretty
friendly You want to see if
 Whats the trap made of
 Okay how about this
 Yasha Im sure
youll agree we can make one move to see if its
interested in nonviolence and then we have the
advantage here now
 I dont like being tailed in particular
 Dont you
 That means literally nothing to me
 I dont think we should stealth
 Fuck the ambush Theres nine of us One
of him
 Molly Yasha and I will not be stealthing
and heading inward and well be just behind
Jesters diplomatic envoy
  Oh no I was enjoying our
closeness
 Are we sure its the same one
 
 Yes perfect
 Mushrooms
 Question answered Did it move away
 Do you want to chase it
 I think thats a good call
 Well stagger back towards the back line
of our group
 
 Maybe we can get back to talking to the
dead people
 Which ones got the better mouth
 Easy Kiri easy Settle settle
 Underground
 Did any of it precede the attack
 Hes fucking huge
 I thought he was humanoidsized
 Why did you go try to be friends with
that What are you thinking
 This is north towards me
 Xenomorph blood
 Is he unconscious Is he done Is that
it
 Jester and Cali
  as well
 Oh my god
 
 Can I move  feet towards the troll Ill
see the gore and poison splattering all over Beau
and little sizzles coming up and shit and Im
 
 Okay Oh thats  to hit
 And  to hit
 Those were monsters jeez d plus four
thats eight points on the first one and thats
 points on the second one

second one They both miss
 You get your ass out of this forest

you here anyway
 Sure Ill do it Ill take two more
Eldritch Blasts at it At disadvantage right
Thats a natural one My bad   Thatll hit
thats 
 d Thats nine plus four  points of
Eldritch Blast
 You fucking piece of shit
 Dont you dare tell us what were starting
to think
 Yeah thats right We know where his
hovel is So lesson learned
 Beau is just
 You fucking
 Still one more question
 Yeah in fact could we could take a short
rest while Calebs doing that since that was a
little gnarlier than we anticipated
 So good
 Finish her
 How far does that extend
 It occurred to me from what your friend
said that this location might not be entirely
above ground any longer
 Yeah Two hours past what was it noon
 Maybe it only becomes visible at a certain
time
 Since there are things thatll be snagging
bitches when we get separated
 Cali do you plan to go back to Port
Damali after this if youre successful
Ive got a friend there a legionnaire He rescued
me Hes a dwarf called Grim Im sure hed help
me find a secure place for the artifact I dont
know Yeah I guess Ill try and find somewhere to
hide them and keep on trying to stop these guys
 Absolutely Well lets try our luck
 Certainly not welcome
 Is the water around the tree in a circle
like it pans out from around the side
 Ill go with her just to accompany
 Or when if someone grabs you from the
shore
 Easiest to remember
of this
 Theres a teal piece of fabric thats tied
up on a branch
 How deep is the water without the water
being dispersed Near the base of the tree
 Oh jeez
 Nicely done Whos first
 Wait lets just hold on Ill go in with
darkvision without setting off any lights that
might herald them
 Then Ill get hurt
guys but it comes out of her draconic eye She
brushes her hair to the side and she has a yellow
draconic eye on her left side
 I dont see anything inside here Looks
like there was a broken lamp so careful with fire
cant be it
 Yeah Ill push in a little bit more
 Looking up
 Do I notice any furniture articles
clothing
 
 I believe Cali
 Not that I can see
 Not any danger in the chamber but it
looks like theres more to this room
down there The blood streaks and stuff
 Couldve been
 Nott Bren youre up
 Yep By yourself
 Brackish flesh
 Gross
 Well only one place to go and thats
down
 Yeah sure
 I like what Im hearing Shark fins and
shit Im a happy camper
 Were going to find out how far
 Double knot
 It is kind of enclosed
 I like that idea
 Were good to fuck them up I think
 No I dont think thats a good idea
 I could blind them
 What
 Im not half fish Im halforc
 That is actually not true at all Nott
not at all
 Halfhuman Id assume
 Once

in between them I see this ripple start to form
and I reach out with my hand and Ill grasp at
the space and tear a rip in reality and Ill cast
Hunger of Hadar ripping this foot dome on the
ground
 Ill put it right here so its
Actually No Ill stick it right here Yeah
because it halves it makes it difficult terrain
so lets put it right there Ish
 Only if they start in it or if they end
their turn in it Two different types of damage
 Well actually it says the void is filled
with a cacophony of soft whispers No light
magical or otherwise can illuminate the area of
the foot sphere
 Its just within the sphere theyre
blind
 They take d
 Each of them Do I roll that
 Five four Nine points of damage each
Cold  Tentacle beating
 And theyre in difficult terrain so its
halved
 Yeah you just send whatever youve got in
the sphere Trying to keep them in one spot
 At the end of their turns they must
succeed on a dexterity saving throw
 Oh sorry My fault
 
 That hits
 I have to make a constitution saving throw
to keep the spell Okay strength save Nine
 What do I have to make I forget
 
 That hits
 Natural 
 That is a six and a one so seven points
of acid damage
 Yeah its a sphere of darkness with stars
with milky tentacles whipping around
Thats what it says
 What happens to the harpoon and the cord
sticking out of me
 I appreciate it 
 Im going to hug this wall if I can back
up a little bit and Im going to hold Eldritch
Blast if I see them emerge from the darkness
 Im scooching
 Two three Five points of cold damage
 Yeah they both
 
 I dont know I cant add this fast my
apps breaking
 
 
 I go unconscious I use my Relentless
Endurance to pop back up to one
  plus all that
 Im super strong Where the fuck is it
 
 Its like a dock on a Tuesday morning
 At disadvantage  doesnt hit
 Hes throwing in the dark in the direction
where two guys and hes threading them and
hitting me
 Fair enough Unconscious I go

 Flurry of Beaus
 Ill use half my speed to stand upright
 And Ill unleash two Eldritch Blasts at
that
 Thats a 
 And thats cocked Reach for the sky And
an 
 Six points of damage on the first one and
 points of damage on the second one
 I stand up I get to my feet I touch the
wound area and I fire it across the way
 We can deal with tempers
 Somebody help me check these crates
well
 Do they have any runeish markings on them
or anything like that
 We treat guests so well
Nott would do
 Are there any weapons that the merrow
dropped The hook or the spears Or were they
tridents or anything
 I pick up one of the tridents Does it
seem like an average
 Plus some of us can swim We could pop
down real quick and see whats down there
 Anyone else feel like going for a swim
 Yeah pretty decent
 No
 Sure we have an extra  feet we didnt
really need the rest
 Yeah but I mean were fine Lets do
it
 Yeah Im going to go down and if I start
running short on air Ill come back up
 No you dont need to do that Theres no
need Jester Well take a short rest afterwards
Just a quick little recon
 I drop the rope and jump in
 This is college all over again
 
 Six
 Ill take a big breath blow it all the
way out  Go back under push back
 Whats the depth like as Im going
through
 So I can see the bottom
 Thats not so bad
 Yeah Theres another room Theres five
more of them if I remember
 Yeah theres a whole other cavern
Theres ruins and objects and all sorts of stuff
Were not done with this by a damn sight
 There were so many things There were
crates and objects
 Could be underneath it
 We could guard this entrance and rest up
for a bit get ourselves together and carry
through Its not that far I think everybody
could make it I certainly could help somebody if
theyre not a very good swimmer but
 We could I know there are five but I
think we use this funnel point as a fatal funnel
right We make them come through one at a time We
send some bait bring them back through but only
when were ready What do you think
 Cali
what Im looking for is not here Ive got to try
and find it Ive got to stop these people getting
it The longer I spend here if its not here the
better chance they have of finding it and I cant
let that happen
 Sure
 Are you natural Beau or bigass Beau
 Cali Im just curious You dont want to
try and smash it on the ground real fast Just for
shits and giggles
 Yeah I mean while were all here
 Yasha chuck that shit on the side of the
wall will you
 Were actually traveling all around I was
achieved your objective
artifacts I need to find and destroy but now I
know that they can be Thats what Im going to
focus on
 We might find our way down to the
Menagerie Coast at some point and if we do well
give you a look
Can I write to you if I leave letters Can
we be pen pals Jester
 Strong grip
Mollymauk shake hands
 Remember follow the daggers on the way
out they mark your way
that troll right
 Dramomine
 We got to rest up right
 I think Caleb has a little booby trap for
that dont you
 Add some distance yeah
 I only saw like five
 No but I got pretty fucking sharp eyes
all right They call me EagleEye Fjord where I
come from
  Crow Fjord or maybe raven you
dont know
 It is
 I dont know if we leave the tree
 Yeah
 And we know where the entrance is
 Also very popular
 Thats right Kiri BirdEye Fjord
 Its sticking
 No We make our way up the rope into the
bottom of the tree but the entrance is still open
 Ill take first watch if you want I can
post up outside and do a little illusion work
 Oh my god I cant believe you said it
 Go fuck yourself
 Yeah
 About what time is it anyway Light still
coming in from the outside of the tree
 All right
 Yep
 Shoot
 Youre not good at apologizing
 Yeah Im fucking with you You reckon you
need to apologize
 You know a great place to start with
apologies is to mention the stuff you just said
 No after that right
 One
 Dos
 Yeah thats a really good apology
 Yeah However right Be genuine Dont be
embarrassed to apologize It takes a big person to
apologize for something Little people are the
ones that make mistakes and just let them go
 No like small on the inside
 Thats big of you
 Yeah I think he deserves that Hes been
good to us
 All right
 I think it will You can actually leave
the smile out of it this time just to be clear
 No thats going to set the tone in a real
weird way Theres a thing called sarcasm that you
ride a line with sometimes
 No Beau and I are up first
 Yep Five
 With an arrow in our throat I didnt
see 
 What what
 Hit the wall against the hole right
Well take either side of it either flank
 No because we still want to go down
there
 Molly I want you to get right on the edge
of the hole and keep an eye down the shaft
 Let it come all the way up if it does
 Grapple it fall flat kill it quietly
 It came up the tunnel that was already
there
 I did Eldritch Blast and a  and a 
 Ten and a nine  points of Eldritch
Blast
 Monstrous or
 I will
 Yeah same
 Yeah you and Yasha go
 Nein
 But hes got to stay awake for it
 Oh my god
  Yes
 So boyish
 Nice work Yasha
 Indeed
 Take the rope we start lowering it down
there
 Yep
 I think right before we go under the water
we should
 Oh yeah this is an amphibious assault
 Like five
 Amphibious Yeah theres a sea anenome
under there as well
 Why arent you good in water
 You can hold your breath right
 Listen when we get down there Im going
to swim a rope under the water to where were
going Its going to be like a guide line so
whoever you ride with can pull on the rope and
youll just hang on
 Fuck you Kiri
 No she cant We could leave her in here
with you if you want but if you see trouble
youre going to have to get in that water and come
across
 Yep
 Yep One or the other
 All right Ill take the other foot
section of rope and Ill start wading into the
water and Ill take a swim back the way I went
 
 Its like Aqua Velva
 What do you mean
 Dont worry about me Im just swimming
over there and coming back And then we can cast it
 Its a guideline
 
 Apocalypse Now
  feet
 Where is that Class features
 Racial traits Darkvision  feet
 Do they have an eyeline on me if they
were to look over this way Could they see my head
above the water
 Can I wade forward and look for any stones
or pillars that I might be able to throw the rope
around and tie a knot on
 Thats a two
 Yep Thats amazing
 Im in the water man
 Okay great Ill give it a gentle tug Does
it seem like the structure moves at all
 Ill take a deep breath and Ill use it to
pull myself chest up towards the surface
 Yeah Still five of them I tied it off
Everybody should be able to pull their way across
no problem But we got to be ready to rock when we
get in there Theyre a little distracted
 Yeah
 Or distract away from us and then go
 Or if we want we could cause a commotion
and have them come through the water at us and use
the hole as a funnel
 Thoughts
 Im a very fast swimmer
 I think its  feet actually is my
swimming speed with this damn Mariners armor
Ignore what I said
 Regular speed yeah

 Well then yeah its  feet
 Well with it its my normal walking
speed
 Nah could I guesstimate how far it was
from entrance to portal Where the rope is
 
 Im back
 So you want to head over there
 Okay I see the validity in that
argument
 Pass Without a Trace first

 Oh it does thats right
 Oh roll to see

 You guys are doing good 
 Come on Yasha
 Nein
 Its shallow priest discretion What will
he do Look as the DM muddles his choices
Considers consequences Plans his retribution
 As his hair dangles beautifully in front
of his face Thinks  Im in another
dimension
 So if you hit with your Sentinel does that
mean its speed is reduced to zero
 Wouldnt want to be ya
 Can I Blink back in and go stop
 
 Can I make my way over and up the steps
 Good shit man Good shit
 Think of the baby Stay calm
 Seven points of healing
 Roll low

cord attached to it Is it wrapped around his
wrist or anything Is that how he was pulling
people
 Is it attached to his person in some way
 Ill take the trident and unhook it from
his armor
 These guys were big
 Yeah yall look for shit Im going to
meditate for a hot second
 Where did you leave her
 Are there any stairways or doors or
gates or anything that would lead upwards from
this cavern
 Yeah Ill take a closer look
 
 Natural  for 
 You guys come up here Theres a ton of
arms up here Theres battleaxes and swords but
theres all these trinkets and holy symbols
 Careful
 Yeah I actually wouldnt mind if you
check for magic And Nott actually theres this
fourfoot long box if you want to try and open her
up for me
 I think so It looks to be latched shut in
some way
 The fourfoot long one
 The iron one and the wooden one
 Yeah sure Were kind of in the middle of
a short rest anyways
 Hes still doing his magic circle or
whatever
 Is this on the priest The shallow
priest
 Who are you talking to Jester
 Do you feel the Traveler in here
 Its actually a little discomforting
these symbols
 Theres also some very dark deities here
Asmodeus
 Asmodeus
 Asmodeus Bane the Strife Emperor
Tiamat
 Can you describe what the Bane the Strife
Emperor symbol looks like
 Here
 Its just this little handheld thing
 Can I toss it into the well
 Did any of the shortswords longswords
battleaxes any of those register under Calebs
magic sweep or theyre just nicely made
 Oh put that shit in the pile
 Im not going to interrupt but that
sphere looks very
 Yeah famili Do you mind if I is it
wet
 If it fits the gash in the side of the
sphere
 While hes concentrating on it can I sit
down next to him and touch it
 Yeah
 How do I feel
 I feel funny What happened
 Into me
 I felt like Id seen it before I just
wanted to touch it
 I dont know You ever see something you
felt like youd seen in a dream before but you
dont know why or how
 Im sorry I felt compelled to I felt
like there was half a chance Id touch it and it
wouldnt be there I saw things
 People I knew A man hes very dear to
me I dont understand it but he was I was him
and he was holding the sphere The eye
 Again you ever have that dream where you
look in the water and you see another face looking
back at you like youre someone else
  You said I put the sphere in my
 I saw him do I saw me as him doing the
same thing He was standing over someone covered
in blood and he put the sphere inside of him
 He was my mentor a captain of mine A man
named Vandrin
 Yes I havent seen him in quite some
time I dont know what any of this means but Im
not a fan of losing track of time like that
 I bend over and put my hands on my knees
and
 I dont feel anything I do feel pretty
tired though
 Im not exactly sure He may be dead He
captained a ship that I worked on for many years
and there was an incident
 I believe so There was an explosion and
we were in terrible weather There were waves we
were being thrown about and I was knocked
overboard I never saw what happened to Vandrin
but when I woke up I was back on shore and I
didnt see anything of the ship or him or any of
the other crewmates
 I would like that I would like that very
much he was very good to me when a lot of people
in my life havent been but he was holding the
sphere how could he be holding it if I was
  Ill tell you how I
survived
 Did I recognize the body that was lying in
blood
 No no details I knew this man very well
He was almost like a father to me and I never saw
him holding anything like this Not that I
remember Do I ever remember seeing anything like
that in his quarters in his offices anything
 Its unique Id remember
 Im not leaving anything out
 Im not entirely sure I remember getting
thrown overboard the waves overtaking me It was
a hell of a fight and Im a real good swimmer
but youd come up for air one second and your
mouth would be full of salt water the next I
remember losing track of which way was up Its
funny when youre underwater and its dark the
only way to tell which way is towards the surface
is by blowing bubbles I did that as hard as I
could with all the air that was in my lungs and
those bubbles disappeared I remember it stinging
filling my chest and the next thing I knew I was
facedown on the shore
 Yeah Ive heard a lot of tales of men
drowning being brought back They say that same
thing But no one was with me on that shore I was
alone
 Just a merchant ship He had many
 There was a bit of sabotage on the ship
 I wish I knew If Im lucky one of these
days Ill find out
 The pool water
 But good and evil deities
 On the edge or around it right Not in
 
 For what
you
 But you cant see it I dont have it
 How big is the well
 Oh shit thats not a bad call Ill check
my reflection in the well
 
 Try again
 
 Im tapping like a motherfucker
 
 Anybody want any of the weapons
Shortswords longswords battleaxes
 Whos holding onto the brokenoff hilt
 Do you mind if I carry that
 No Im not
 We have four sticks
 I just said we have two sticks
 Okay all right
 Climbing the rope back up top to the base
of the tree
 Why would they do that
  Genuine
 Not too tight
 Nice job
  Quit while youre ahead
 Drunkass fucking Nott dwelling on old
shit
 He bleeds death and stuff Wed have to
hit him from afar It might not be worth it
 I forget are we returning back to report
in between missions or are we doing a twofer
 What spells that
 Sending
 I guess that would cover it then
 You lost me a little
 What time is it about in the sky parts
 Jester maybe not just yet Maybe before
we go to sleep
 And remember he bleeds damaging liquids
 Or something that we would totally do
 Im down for that
 Two votes Three votes Four five votes

 Sure Maybe we have Nott bolt in right

fast right
 Very dextrous

sucker If he pops out we light it up from afar
 Caleb you got that photographic memory

 Wow

way
 Indeed So much so that we seem to have
been relieved of our coin during last nights revelry
 Yeah Does that happen a lot around here
 Well that might not be necessary I
believe it was our fault But just out of
curiosity is there anywhere in town that I dont
know there might be an infestation of this sort
of problem Do you know any common areas where
folks engaged in this sort of activity might
gather at night or in the day Areas of trouble
that youve dealt with before oh god am I sweating

a half a cow and then maybe once thats soaked up
some of this Ill return If I remember anything else

morning

little visit to Rissas pops
 When we get there after our run I chuck

group
 We will take it under consideration
 Cleff do you also have simple arms

anvil
 You raised her good Shes been taking
good care of us
 Awkward
 I believe shes incorporated Shes

 Wait a minute
 Indeed Im sure their employers are not
fond of thieves in their midst
 Ooh its on
 Yeah Fitz did seem like a prick didnt
he
 Fitz I understand that you might have
felt a little slighted by last nights encounter
 I didnt say you could talk What I want
to know is when you came back into the bar last
night did you see fit to rummage your way through
some good hardworking peoples coin purses
 How about your friend Ashton over there
 See now were in a dangerous territory
because once that staff comes out shes got to
hit something with it and its not going to be
me Listen Fitz The best thing you can do here
you ever seen anyone around that establishment
that might take advantage of some people enjoying
some good imbibements
 Oh Fitz Tick tock tick tock
 Oh no
 I know its mine
 
 Were making kids cry This is amazing
 You dont know anyone else that has made a
habit of doing this regularly then
 You might get it ready Nott I feel like

staff if in the next  hours you work your ass
off and you find out who took our money
 Easy Beau Remember what you said
 This is not going to go well for you
unless you can produce some results
 Well if you got to work you got even
less time Better be motivated
 Excellent
 Yeah might scare them straight
 Its our pleasure
 We take our leave
 Yeah when we were in there the shields and
swords they looked fairly standard or were there
some that were like holy shit

Assembly Yard
 And just out of curiosity the Silver
Falls the residential area how far is that
 Ol Blemmys over in the Silver Falls

 But we have no leads on the girl correct
No one saw her knows her name

 Do you bite your silver pieces before you
put them in your coin purse
 Like little tiny dicks
 Silver Falls
 If there was a way to ask about
 If you could ask about large purchases

 Silver Falls
 Keeping an eye out for old craggly
sailortypes

 Eight
 Throwing up while we do it
 Yep That motherfucker had leather apron
with shittyass sleeves
 Lets turn it down
 No Whos going to guard the back

 How old are you
 You said you havent had your parents
around for a while now What happened to them
 Doing what
 Here In Hupperdook
 The Changebringer
 Tithe collectors
 You all brothers and sisters
 And your parents names
 Gail you been taking care of your younger
siblings this whole time
 You been holed up here or you on the
move
 How long before the tithe man comes back
 Gilda and Wallace Let me ask you if we
were to somehow get your parents out of the
Gearhold prison would you stay here
 Im the one asking questions here
 You dont seem to be taking my meaning If
we were to reunite you with your folks would you
get out of town right quick
 Give us a moment will you
 The Partridge Family
 Keyleth No but seriously Listen
theyve obviously done a fair job of
taking care of themselves We could toss them some
coin and wish them well
 Or if were serious about returning Cleff
with his  might as well see if we
can get a little extra friend or two out
 No promises but man if we have an
opportunity to reunite these kids with their
parents thats a pretty special deed dont you
think
 Man I entirely forgot
 I think its Do I believe him right
 They said the tithe man could return any
day
 What if we come back and theyre gone
 Youd eat a child
 I knew I saw you drooling
 I would really like the opportunity to
leave this place better than we found it
especially for these kids
 I understand If it goes sideways it goes
sideways and we run But if we can keep them out
of an orphanage I would be most grateful to all
of you
 Yes I was Theyre terrible fucking
places
 Agreed
 The effort is all I ask for Were a
clever group Surely we can survey come up with a
plan try something If we fail we fail and
well move on with our objective I cant leave
here without trying
 How about we bring the kids back in we
give them a little coin so they stay out of
trouble for the next
 We tell them to stay put unless theyre
getting food
 With the girl we found right
 Or we could drop Kiri off with the little
girl that
 You take care of each other Youre a
little temporary family for now
 Remember stay quiet
 Could have just gone back and bought it
but no we want to go the expert level
 Pay attention
 No we got our thumbs Where is Where is

 Yasha Yasha doesnt know

trying to work on our minds first Sounds like

night I preferred it to the beating though
 Probably ours

closest friends I know I would want it so we
should probably keep it for Yasha when she wakes
In the Bag of Holding
 Its pretty big
 We dont have to do that
 Glad you guys are keeping track
 Caduceus can I ask what your involvement
is How you became involved in this
 He makes what
 You make dead people into tea
 Should we wait for Yasha to wake up or do
we bring her with
 Shes got a day and a spell
 Yeah I figured
 Kind of already was but yeah
 Lets do it

 Its not the tarp thats the source of the
illusion

with a sickass goatee
 Birds galore

Staring at the coat Ill summon the new sword
 In the way that I was taught by Vandren I

that long but youve shown us incredible kindness
and care and Im very grateful for that I will

 You dont understand though My whole
life was trying to blend in trying to keep an eye
out for someone that was looking to take
advantage that was going to exploit I got
comfortable I felt relaxed Theres no reason why
the three of us out on watch couldnt see them
coming out and raise an alarm fast enough
 Ill drink to that
 Yeah It puts everything in perspective
though Ill tell you that much
 I was floating around trying to find my
way to the Cerberus I dont know if thats what I
want to do anymore
 I felt like I almost died and I hadnt
taken care of any of the shit that got me here in
the first place I was so worried about trying to
learn about these new abilities that I felt like
I got distracted I have people I want to find and
things I want to remedy
 I mean fuck its really disturbing
Like she came out of there like a little kettle
of popcorn just no problem I mean Can I see
Jester Is she nearby
 I was worried There were really dark
times I would hear Jester singing to herself at
night and then shed change lyrics and then my
name would be in the lyrics sometimes Every
morning she would try and cheer everybody up that
was around her but she had the muffle So I
couldnt tell if my brain was playing tricks on
me or if she was just I dont think theres
much that gets her down Its kind of inspiring
 An act
 It is kind of fucked that theres no music
right now and shes just
 That was well placed
 Youve heard it before Did you have a lot
of cemetery folks that were good for goodnatured ribbing

fucking IV under the desk Holy shit
 Wider brim
 On Halloween all the kids are outside
 Yeah her chests Sorry
 Are you not entertained
 Yeah
 It came out of the ground
 Maybe not from her
 Just bailed

 Sure Yeah The previous events have
rocked Fjord a little bit Are there any bars or
taverns in Zadash that may house frequent sailors
or people of trade merchants
 I know that Ive made that trip How far
is it from Zadash back to the northernmost part of
the Menagerie Coast
  I think Fjords going to take a
steed and start heading south by himself
 While he heads south Id like to adopt
various disguises as I stop in inns taverns
places of trade and carefully hear if anyone is
mentioning the name Sabian if people are
talking about ships and try and casually make my
way further south knowing that I have an amount
of time to get back north Id like to try to make
my way down and see what I can hear and find out
 Okay  nine and a six
 Yeah I think Ill make it to the end of
that week and start to make my way back
 No I know now that the strength is in the
numbers of the group Ill stop and head back
 Yeah
 Thats about it
 Jesus Fuck your bracers
 I got new shit 
 Thats some restricted reading bullshit
 I forgot I shouldve looked at my list I
had one or two other little things
 I was like I feel like I came up Oh
theres more shit
 Yeah We can just say on the way back from
those visits at night when I made camp I want to
summon the falchion and spend more time with it
Examine it specifically the eye if it has that
sort of in the letter it looked like there was
a gash into the sphere itself Does it represent
that is it smooth Does it move
 Is it near the crossguard or is it near
the pommel
 Super fast
 Creepy What the hell does that mean
Okay When I get back could I make my way to The
Gentleman for just a quick convo
 You guys are going to shop ah
 What was it
 Yes I appreciate you making some time for
me this evening Turns out we might be traveling a
little bit pretty soon Were going to be making
our way towards the Wayfarers Cove Your
knowledge of areas outside of Zadash seems so
extensive what with the errands you sent us on I
was wondering could you share with me any
knowledge you might have about criminal
underbellies any competitors you might have in
business thats not of an official nature in
cities particularly around Nicodranas Port
Damali the Menagerie Coast Is your reach that far
 Thats where I was going with that
 Yeah its where Im from
 Indeed
 Father Dwondaff Pierce
 I bring many gifts
 Indeed I wouldnt dare After all you do
have a little way of keeping track of where we are
and what we do
 I appreciate your help in this matter
Hopefully we can be of some service to you down there
 Please do
 You can be assured that I will Thank you
for your time Ill leave you now
  Hm
 Tell me about these dreams
 Oh god Oh thats good 
  God why was I gone for six
weeks Okay  Yes unfortunately
your dreams may have some merit I myself was
missing for most of our journey and it seems
unfortunately that Lucien befell a terrible
fate
 Im sorry to be the one to let you know
If I was there I could give you more detail but I
found out much in the same way you are
 You said he left before and then came
back If you dont mind my asking the last time
that he left do you remember the circumstances of
his departure
 And then you saw him here for the first
time in quite a while yes
 Two years Two years Are you and
forgive me if this is too personal are you
expecting to see him again
 Indeed maybe it was You have my
apologies and my condolences
 I hate to leave you with such sour news
but I must be going
 Fuck Then Ill head back to The Leaky
Tap
 Its a gift
 Your Anarchists Cookbook
 A negative three to your deception
 You can reappear ten feet away Its
either ten or five
 But you have to roll for it
 But youve got to roll  or higher for
you to even blink out in the first place
 You got it  or higher No problem
 Are there
 You can kill him
 Get the fuck out
 Oh here we go
  Dont mind that
 Do you still look like the lord of the
 Two steps
 That is easily the most fucked two
characters have ever been to a full reversal
That is the deepest fuckage weve ever dipped a
toe in
 Keyleth getting arrested I dont give a
shit You guys were fucked
  Secret cabal because there
are so many of them
 Yeah feed the baby give it life
 An uneventful two weeks for everyone I
assume
 Oh thats good New books
 Right Beau you look like you got a
couple new little marks and stuff
 Yeah I never even met a ghost How would
you punch it
 Okay Nott
 How was your
 Yeah
 Nice
 Caduceus
 How was your time
 Have you met more than one ghost before
 You dont have to tell me any more its
fine Ill just imagine the worst possible
 I have a request Upon further inspection
of this here letter Quenpillar is the month that
were in which we all know right
 It is How time flies
 While I have no idea who Marius LePual or
Evantica or any of this is this was supposed to
be delivered by the end of this month to the
Wayfarers Cove
 Its back in help me
 The Menagerie Coast Where Jester and I
are from
 I have Nicodranas is where Jesters from
Im from Port Damali
 I dont I dont
 I dont
 I was thinking about it I journeyed a
little further south Im actually looking for
someone and I had been meaning to head back that
way anyway If this is taking us in that
direction if itll teach us anything more about
the you know 
 Yes it was
 Either way I dont feel very comfortable
with it residing in my person
 Nope I just feel like me It was the
vision that came with it that fucked me up a
little bit
 No but I just kept replaying it over and
over It was dark for so long and there was
nothing really to distract you I just kept seeing
his face and him holding the orb and pushing it
into his or my chest and the body on the
ground
 Yeah
 Does he say stuff like that a lot
 Sure yeah
 Its warmer and theres certainly less
snow
 Who are you drinking
 I previously wanted to go north to the
Soltryce Academy but I feel like thats another
step in the direction thats not pressing for
right now
 Yeah Theres no telling that theyre going to
share any information with me anyway Im fucking
absorbing things and shit just appears and Im
getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to
do with the things that Im learning Theres no
books or knowledge its just happening What if
they look at me like you guys look at me
sometimes What if they dont let me go Maybe
thats not where I need to be
 Like weird shit is happening
 Its hard when youre the only one
experiencing it Its hard to relay
 Im certainly open to that
 What do you want to know
 No I dont believe so I did tell Molly
before we were taken about a crewmate of mine
named Sabian He was the one that ambushed the
ship that caused the explosion that threw me
overboard The one that probably sent Vandren to
his fate After I woke up on the shore afterwards
I found the sword and I wasnt quite sure where I
was I found a road and managed to hitch a ride
back towards Port Damali and when I got there I
went to Vandrens storehouse and I planned to go
through his things I was more high up on the crew
than Sabian was but his place had been ransacked
Gone through Torn through There was a local
butcher next door that I walked into and he had
said that he was glad to see at least one other
was the other one He had said Sabian So I feel
like he somehow survived He knows what happened
why it happened I cant bear the thought of
something happening to me because Im pursuing
this And I summon the sword
 I dont want to be focused on this I want
to be focused on that Plus I feel like if those
events led to this maybe theres a remedy for the
whole thing
 Or just kill him Thatd be fine But
yeah maybe some answers first
 He and I have a long history But after
he So we were in the storm He ran belowdecks
and he placed a bundle next to a lot of the crates
that we were shipping That was unusual for him
so I followed him down and I saw him with a
lantern in his hand and when he turned he had lit
what looked like a fuse I called out he threw a
few daggers at me They hit I went down he ran
past me Just as I made my way back above decks I
called his name and I saw him at the bow of the
ship and it looked like he was preparing to jump
overboard which in a storm like that is insane
Thats when the explosion hit It ripped into my
back It threw me over and I remember going underwater
and seeing parts of the ship fall and
flames above the water I could see things
falling and some of it was cargo and some of it
looked like me I just feel like he was prepared
to get the hell out of Dodge
 No My teacher and my captain Vandren is
the one I saw in this vision and he had the same
sphere I saw myself through his eyes and he was
holding the sphere and pushing it into his chest
He was also standing over a man I saw his
reflection He seemed younger so I dont know
when it was but I didnt know that side of him
He was an exacting man Firm but fair and it
just leaves more questions than I have answers
to
 I honestly dont know Ive thought about
what it was like before I had this Ill make the
sword disappear Life was simple but I dont feel
like I had the ability to affect my surroundings
I was not a proponent of change Its selfish but
I feel like I can do things now I dont know if I
would get rid of it but I want to know what
happened to him I owe him that much
 Yeah I was thinking that if you wouldnt
be opposed we could go back to the Menagerie
Coast stop by your moms place in Nicodranas
 Yeah I was telling them I feel like
instruction isnt exactly what I need its not
going to get me anything yet I just feel like I
need to take steps in the right direction does
that make sense Feels like Im stalling
 Yeah the letter does say the Wayfarers
Cove and it says its supposed to be delivered by
the end of this month so I feel like theres some
urgency if were going to capitalize on
intercepting this
 Oh I hadnt realized What if you show up
with inherent abilities
 No certainly not yet If it will help me
find that fuck then Id prefer to hold onto them
 I dont know how Id give it back
 Poop it out
 Then I ate the poop stone Yep Didnt
wash it off or nothing
 It was underwater though so
 Canon

  I poop out my peehole
 Yep
 I would hate to go without all of you
 Just to be clear we can meet your mom
but you cant
 Youre just not supposed to be seen coming
back
 Got it

 Jester
 How has it been Busy Peaceful
 I think thats right actually
 Arrested
 An indeterminate amount of time
 This was the first one we made a clean
positive impact though Minimal collateral damage
 No IOUs or you know
 Totally recognize him now
 Kind of led to the influx of people going
out
 Is there any word from the south We
happen to be heading that way
 Global Entry
 Couldnt hurt
 Thats not true Jester I still have some
plans for that letter It does have his signature
on it though
 Let them enjoy their drink please

a while
 Salt on the wind its amazing

 Oh yeah You thought you were getting
jewels but youre getting rocks and shit

 I jump in the invisible part of the cart
 Dark salt and pepper hair
 You couldnt see how long his hair was
underneath
 Pale skin
 We got a stern warning as we left
 Adla for short
 Im glad to see your prickly demeanor is
still in shape
 Yeah thats true
 Yeah I was going to ask
 
 Should we try to see Gustav tonight
 Did you want to bail him out
 You bailing him out tonight
 That is so generous Nott
 I feel like we should just carry you
through the town crying out Gustavs release
paid by this sweet little girl
 Well we could go in the morning it
doesnt matter
 Excellent news Very glad to hear that
 Were just trying to achieve one thing
and that was hopefully to get some eyes on our
good friend Gustav if we could
 Extended stay
 How time flies
 Maybe just a little something towards it
if we could
 The circus and the fucking
 Whywolves Too many Too many sorry
 I know youve taken this burden on
yourself but I think we would all feel a bit
better if you would accept this as a small
thank you for then and now as well
 Why dont you make some tea and shut the
fuck up for a second
 Are we out of earshot
 Lets all group shuffle out of earshot

 Caduceus What was that Where did that
come from
 You can tell that just from looking at
him
 Come on you tall magical cow
 Gold

halforc
 Oh What I just said  Listen to
Beau she knows the score

 And I wink
 Excellent idea
 No she took off like she does
 Its an expression
 Yeah just blunt
 Maybe we will
 Well give you a little lessons in
economics as we travel just for fucking future
parley situations
 Theres a lot of reasons
 Yeah well get into it we got time
 We need a damn whisper cam
 Deep meaning
 Whats in the box
 Yeah
 The best part is when people try to
explain it to other people and theyre like
What does it mean And they say Dick in the
peanut butter and theyll be like 
No what does it really mean Its dick in the
peanut butter
 Are you pretending to have actually looked
in the Players Handbook for once
 Youre half gnome and half minotaur
  Kill them now

 Yeah
 To be honest with you Caduceus that was
not here the last time I was here
 Yeah theyre the Righteous Brand I
remember maybe a tenth of that I assume border
tensions are pretty high
 I think we should be fine After all
were leaving were not entering
 Weve traveled four days to the south to
the Wuyun Gates
 You and I came through when we were coming
north and there were a couple guards Now theres
like 
 Perhaps we empty the cart walk on foot
and say were looking to go out and bring goods
and wares back into the Empire
 Caduceus youve got a little
 Yep
 They are searching both ways it looks
like
 What kind of contraband do we have Weve
got a couple pouches of fungus and thats about it
 I agree Lets risk it
 Nothing wrong with having an invisible
cart
 Yep
 Oh the dodeca
 Shouldnt I since Ive never done it
before

I mean everybodys seen the ocean before right
 Wait one two three Never seen the
water
 You should its amazing

 Wow I feel like were about to improve
all of your general experiences of the world
 Maybe we drive towards the coast and then
you know take the PCH down to Nicodranas What do

 Jester Caduceus looks awful confused
Maybe you could fill him in again about why your
 No I do Im looking out for our tall cow
friend
 No I know whats happening Im just
trying to you know schedule a tea break
 Would you remember his name
 Did he just visit all the time or is he
well known in Nicodranas for business or shady dealings
 Oh you just found out afterwards
 Yep indeed
 The road down is treacherous The benefit
of being on the coast is that you limit your field
of danger right its only going to come from one
direction Thats just something to keep in mind
 Yeah no Not true actually I have never
seen
 Nope
 That could be a pituitary thing I have
never seen a sea creature in my life
 Did you really
 Do I believe her
 Ooh thats not terrible Oh it is
terrible 
 Oh shit Okay
 Oh I mean as close as you want to be If
you want to put your feet in its an amazing experience
 Its colder than you might think
 From where we are now would I have any
idea how far from the gates that we just have we
passed through the gates
 Well were so close we might as well stop
in
 Yeah Well or your moms place Whatever
you want to do first
 Yeah I forget you havent seen it So if
you look in one direction and you look
immediately to your left and then immediately to
your right all that shit is ocean
 All of it And as far as you see that
line
 The horizon Thats all ocean too
 It is
 Blue skin gone
 Super tan skin
 Those are seagulls They are some
dickheads If you leave food out theyll snake
that shit in a second
 Oh yeah And they drop shit on you from
above so keep your eye out
 These ones in particular are pricks
 Oh the lessons
 Right Pretty nice Soak it up man
 See Nott Easy as pie
 I think his ears are underwater
 Im not stopping her
 Say goodbye to that King Charles spaniel
 So happy
 Cant wait for this to go wrong
 Well yeah sure
 Nott are you sure you dont want to come
in Im sure Jester would hold your hand or something
 Okay Ill walk up to the shore and put my
boots in ankles deep in the water and stand
there Then Ill summon the falchion next
to my side
 Hmm How far out is Caleb in the water
 Can I use Misty Step to appear right next
to him in the water and scare the shit out of him
 Whoa hey All right there chief Okay
all right youre good Sorry
 Sorry I just figured you want some
company Its really tranquil isnt it
 Yeah You seem very at home in the water
Im surprised
 Caleb
 I mean I must commend you A lot of
people are very trepidatious in the face of a
force of nature like this
 It suits you very well
 Oh I didnt leave it intentionally I
tried to make my way back up north to see if I
could learn more about the sword and everything
But Ive always loved the water yeah
 It does yeah I would live right on the
water if I could Yeah
 Yeah I take care of what I need to take
care of I think a calm life on the water would
suit me just fine
 Those sandbars are unpredictable man
They drop right the fuck off
 Thats an old wives tale its not true
 What is it with Nott and the water do you
have any idea
 It might be yeah I think that might have
been the tentacle that Jester saw from
 Youre actually in for this is a treat
The sunsets are gorgeous here
 No were going with you yeah
 Agreed
 Well we should definitely go see Jesters
mom
 Listen the ocean will be here and weve
got plenty of time to come back and fish all
sorts of stuff
 I know I can feel the disappointment
 Yeah I know But hey the anticipation
keeps building right And then payoff
 Itll be that much more special
 Well get you some floaties
 Yep Theyll sink you like a stone
 Fair enough it is getting dark Lets dry
off get our clothes back on and get moving
 But you get amazing storms right
Thunder lightning
 It gets foggy here sometimes
 Oh Well
 Thats just the jellyfish sting taking
effect
 This is all very familiar to me
 Yeah
 Well just on our way up into
 Yeah Im from Port Damali but I had seen
her a couple times in the city
 Right As were walking through to make it
to Jesters moms place any familiar faces
catching eyes
 Nine
 We can tell from their posture that
theyre not on leave theyre actually there more
on duty
 Its more of a cush posting
 No theyre pretty legit Because
honestly this is where the bigwigs go so they
want the best right Theyre not going to take a
bunch of jackoffs with them
 Yeah the Clovis Concord is iron clad
Its some hefty penalties Everything from
stealing to murder puts you away for quite a
while and its a hefty fine
 That whole spectrum in between You can
fill in everything that happened in your mind when
I said those two It applies to that shit as
well
 Kidnapping
 Yeah in between those two
 They dont like them
 Dont fuck with the postal service
 I shouldnt have surprised you man Im
sorry about that Shit
 Sorry Youve got to nah Im not going
to say it
 Do we have to pay to get in
 What was your name again Fiona
Fancypants

 Youre still very tall
 A simple what
 That sucks
 Theres more where that came from if you
take good care of them
 The dogs going to piss everywhere
 Oh
 Yeah You just got peed on Beautiful
 Oh yes I got to give it up
 You said with those nine people that are
in the room how many tables are there about
 Ten tables
 Fiona do you recognize anyone in this
room
 You do
 But I meant the patrons Anybody that
 Yeah Is it better near the front or in
the back
 Well get as close to the stairs as
possible
 After he peed on you
 Youre going to see a show what could
happen
 Thats great Was she happy to see you
 While weve been sitting down there I
have not disguised the way I look Any glances

us
 Oh yeah were here We are here
 Feet up on the other chair

 Fourpony
  DD
  DD Beyond
 That was really something
 You cant even watch ASPCA commercials
 It was mesmerizing Jester I mean she
really had an effect on the room Was it just me
or did the lights seem to dance when she was
singing
 You have that
 Making them want an encore huh
 Stunning
 Do you ever wish you could do what she
does
 Your singing voice is nice
 Oh thats right Man that was our
first
 Did you want to spend more time with your
mother Did you
 He didnt look very happy
 Does she have to deal with a lot of
jealous suitors
 Shes got lots of security obviously
This place seems you know pretty well
 I think wed all like to meet her Would
tomorrow be the time for that
 Marquis Demesne
 Marquez
 Its a pleasure I can see where Jester
gets her good looks from
 Ill give it a kiss
 I do I try to
 Shes good Shes very good
 Always with the teeth
 Shes been very helpful in a few frays We
owe her quite a bit
 Nott remember what we talked about
Criminal penalties
 Yeah thats one A Bingo
 Indeed Would you mind if I asked your mom
a few
 Just because youre so wellestablished in
this region so wellknown and connected as you
mentioned does the name Marius LePual ring any
bells
 Well if it wouldnt be too much of an
inconvenience
 Ionos is another name mentioned in the
letter
 No Its many thanks to you I think
its an I
 Please we dont want to get you in any
sort of trouble
 Oh sure discretion is appreciated
 The who
 I dont mean to pry into your business too
much but are your appointments exclusively here
or have you ventured to his place
 Understood Do you know where we might be
able to find him Does he say where he stays
  Understood Im sure with a
personality as large as his it wont be too hard
to find some information on him some gentle
poking around
 That you do
 Jester I have to say I dont feel any
great rush to continue on out of the city until
you at least feel that your mother is safe and
protected
 Jester looks extremely motivated Perhaps
we taking care of this simple errand for you might
help compensate for a few nights stay
 Leaky Tap
 Oh my god were freaking out Keep it
together
 What was he named
 Draw off
 Those are some huge sweat drops
 Jester that is quite the revelation Your
dad I mean Babenon is tracking us
 Oh god
 Probably doesnt bother your mom
 Please tell me it plays with those exact
pauses
 Youre 
 Thank you
 Yeah lets call it a night Thank you
 How do you feel
 Did you want to have a drink and think
about it or go for a walk
 What about a night swim
 Weve done very right by him but weve
also tipped him off to the fact that you assume
that he might know your mother at a more intimate
level
 Would be nice to see his face when you ask
the question you know what I mean
 Should we turn in for the night then
 He came from the sea
 Yeah
 Four poster gaudyass
 Howd you sleep Jester
 You know I was thinking one thing that
might help take your mind off this is making sure
your mom stays safe Right Take some solid steps
to making sure that Galdar
 Yeah
 There is actually a lot to do this
morning I feel like we should send some to check
out the lighthouse maybe talk to the Wharfmaster
and maybe send someone to
 Yeah just some lax scouting you know
 Anything I think
 Yeah I would like to find the
Wharfmaster
 Weve managed to enter relatively quietly
I think if we can maintain a certain level of
anonymity we can acquire some decent knowledge
Meet back here in a little while and share
 I suppose we could Lighthouse and the
Wharfmaster
 Ooh I like it
 Midday
 I would like to talk to the Wharfmaster
 Plus it would be a good chance to ask
around about Algar Hes influential in the city
 Whos going to the lighthouse
 Okay You three Nott do you want to come
to the Wharfmaster so you can take a swim
 Yeah Guns out
 Four to the lighthouse two to the
Wharfmaster I like it
 Before we get there I pull Beau aside
All right so this is my turf
 There may be some familiar faces We came
in before and I didnt change the way I looked I
wanted to see if maybe that caused a rustle Im
going to change the way I look now
 Yeah
 I dont know I want to ask about my old
crew and my captain Son of a bitch betrayed us
and all that I dont want people to know that Im
alive When I was back in Port Damali and I went
looking through stuff my mere presence there when
none of the rest crew was was enough to get looks
Its what drove me out so I think Ill be able to
discover more if
  me Yeah
 Sure Yeah
 Yep Ill use Mask of Many Faces to make
myself look like a very tanned human with jet
black hair pulled back into a tight ponytail in the
back With a black goatee Maybe slightly overweight

 Had some better days in the s
 My name is Sheagal
  Steven Seagal
 Oh god yes I know what that modifier is
No
 Thank you That was the same roll both
times That was really shit Eight
 Yeah I dont know
 Ill make my way up to him if hes not
busy
  Yes Im so sorry I
was wondering if I might be able to speak with the
Wharfmaster And Ill produce two gold coins and
start to rub them together
 Im sorry were quite new in town
unfortunately my companion and I We are from
Port Damali where we are trying to put down our
business roots here Im sorry does Vandren and
his crew do they make shipments here regularly
Its one of my return clients
  off of a natural 
 Oh Why did I roll advantage on that
  Why did I do that Sorry
 You dont say
 Thats quite unfortunate Ive been given
a task here in town Algar does he do a lot of
business here on the wharf
 I happen to have crossed paths with him
one night while drinking I guess we made quite
the impression on him and we are to deliver some
items to his place of residence However my
friend here was shitfaced and we forgot to ask
where he lives I was hoping perhaps if you
could give us a point in the right direction
 Oh yes then that would be most helpful
 The Sluice Weave Not loose leaf Sluice
Weave
 Oh fantastic that helps us immensely Do
you know of anyone else looking for a merchant
perhaps on the cheaper side services
 Yes rare things and very boring things
at times
 Dezima
 Wonderful This has been most helpful
Well I thank you for your time Are there any
available docks for rent or for lease if we happen
to come upon some vessels or ships
 One other thing we heard a gentleman over
at the bar speaking and someone called out to
him Marius LePual Does that ring how do you
say that name
 How were we saying the last name
 
 Yes very gregarious personality from what
we could see What does he do exactly
 That is where we should look
 Ah yes We did notice actually last
night there seemed to be an influx of strange
characters coming in last night Did you happen to
see anything around this area
 Anything in particular that caught your
eye
 Im sorry Im so new here I was just
hoping to acclimate myself and perhaps
 Ah Yes Perhaps its time we take our
leave
 Thank you
 Maybe we do like the three backward steps
and then the turn and then both walk out
 Yeah you were great
 Yeah that came out of nowhere You got a
lot better at that Okay So I dont know where
do we start Well I guess we meet back up with
the others
 I know
 Smash All right lets get him
 Were going to head to what time is it
ish
 Oh shit fuck
 Yeah we should go meet with the others
 Hes a damn serial killer I knew it
Calm motherfucker
 The triple blink afterwards
 We shoot horses outside just on
Tuesdays
 Oh my god I love her
 Oh fucking callback Amazing
 Fuck your character names
 So good
 Shit
 Youre not ganking that telescope
 Ive mastered standing so still
 I was going to say as were walking can
we snag a passerby and ask what that structure is
  Yes were new in town and
couldnt help but notice that structure there
Very unique What is it
 Theres a mage that owns this district
 They dont get on do they
 Around the Tide Peak do we see the
Zolezzo the guards around it Or is it not as
guarded as other structures are
 Are we far away Hundreds of feet Less
 Im sure a detour wouldnt hurt us
 A closeup Scenic
 Lets do it Well make a detour to go
closer to that on the way to the Open Quay
 No bodies of water pools lakes
decorative
 How close did Beau get to investigate
like that
 I thought he said before you started to
melt
 Weird that theyre avoiding the thing
 And green Why so different Can we touch
the outside of it
 Do you see an entrance
 Is it a super long like a tower
 How about we nonchalantly walk by the
entrance to get an idea
 I didnt see a door
 Windows
 feetup balcony and other balconies
above that
 Oh shit its real tall
 Well how do you get into a tower with no
doors
 Yep You cant parkour up that wall 
feet can you
 Yes
 I absolutely would love it
  feet is pretty far
 Im helping her Im giving her the old

 Ugh
 I did not catch her
 Im sorry Im not real strong I thought
youd make it up
 Youre getting damage because of that
 Well let the others know Okay and well
go to the Open Quay
 We were trying to get into the tower
Theres no doors
 Well Ive seen it several times coming
through before Its called the Tide Peak but
there are no doors
 Did they have doors
 Yeah everybody seems to be avoiding it
it sticks out in the general area and theres no
doors I just found it odd Maybe its a puzzle
 Oh maybe They said theres a mage
here that presides over this district
 Jester do you know anything about this
tower
 We heard the same
 Pretty sure its the Sluice Weave
 Why
 Oh you need an invite
 We were here on time you know
 Long and rather skinny so
 We did find out that Marius LePual fuck
that last name Hes sometimes seen at some of the
taverns around some of the shadier ones The Skew
or the Open Quay
 Yeah were in the district its like a
wharf
 The Meandering Treasurer
 Is a shop
 Yeah
 Yeah Wayfarers Cove is is supposed to
be delivered to Marius
 We got to take whats given to us and
right now we dont have an invite to get down to
the Sluice So we might as well go by The
Wayfarers Cove
 Were going were on the way were
going Unless you want to fuck with this tower a
little bitThe tower is super interesting to me
Its  feet tall no doors
 Can you climb  feet
 Ooh salt
 Yes
 We are continuing on but I just want
to point out that the place with no doors
also fucking shrunk
 Yeah it tickles your pickle doesnt it
 Within somethings up mmhmm
 Make it do the thing
 Yeah like a sea like a normal crew

 Ill turn over my shoulder
 Yeah
 
 Yeah Revoke your travel status Never

of a ship not two minutes before you walked in
 Yeah that happened
 Has all our blood
 Whats in the sack
 Gross
 We didnt really get to explain You were
the last to wake up of the three of us and by the
time you came around we had met Mr Clay He
apparently worked in a graveyard Cemetery I want
to get it right
 Oh fucking shit
 He makes tea out of dead people I know
Like it sounds
 How did the vision of these islands come
to you
 The Stormlord
 You commune with the Stormlord The
Stormlord
 Thats significant
 We have missed you we dont mean to pry
 Interact with that fucking weasel
 Tide Peak
 Its midday This guys like Fucking
money tourists
 Nott why dont you get up on a table
and get everyones attention and ask the room if
they know anything about Algar
 Everybody your attention please 
 Every fucking last one of you
 Weve threatened them with goblin
tactics
 I love that monologue
 Midnight
 LePual
 I mean it couldnt hurt to do a
driveby and just see if we could see anything
 I thought they were too I thought the
entrance was underwater
 Well yeah everybody can swim
 Are you strong enough to pull us up
 Got to start somewhere
 Yeah but I mean at least if were
heading towards the docks where the entrances are
Im sure more people in that area will know
 Should I secure us a rowboat
 Pretty sure I can
 Is there a ship shack or something that
would lease vessels
 Its an official term guys 
 Old timer Im sorry to bother you I
dont see a mariners office around here Is that
your rowboat
 Fjord
 Jimmy
 Absolutely
 Little bit little bit my friends here
were hoping to explore the coast a bit And if I
could put some coin in your pocket I was
wondering if you would mind parting with your
vessel here for a little bit
 Tales of the worst greenhorns youve ever
worked with
 That is most kind of you we are much
obliged
 Is it big enough for all of us
 Actually thats not a terrible idea I
was going to volunteer to be pulled by
 Its tied up to the dock
 Caleb seems very comfortable Since it
only fits a few folks I
 No you have to come with I was going to
volunteer to trail behind the armor helps
 Oh thats right
 What You get smaller What do you mean
 Is that a Disguise Self thing
 Does it change your physical weight and
stuff
 Oh it is a firbolg thing Well fuck thats
awesome
 I think youll be fine actually if Jester
and I are trailing behind
 Some people arent scared of the water
Nott Its actually quite safe
 Look Nott And I reach down into the
water and touch it with my hand There is
absolutely noth  I just fall right
into the water
 Just churning bubbles and stuff
 I pop back up See Totally fine
 Youll never know
 Have you been here a few days already
 Oh
 Well somebodys got to ask if anybody has
any idea where the entrance to the
 The entrance
 Im in the water with you
 Im covered in armor
 Okay Price of a good joke Im afraid Are
you knowledgeable about the entrance to the Sluice
Cove Sluice Weave
 Well
 Thanks
 Yeah he was telling the truth
 Because I know sailors
 Why dont you threaten him with a trove of
goblins around the wharf while
 Is there anyone else on the docks Anyone
else that we can see
 Are there any crownsguard or Im going to
say zoleezzo
 Zolezzo thank you
 Hey Beau
 You know those people skills weve been
working on
 You want to ask the zolezzo if they mind
telling some tourists about the fabled entrance to
the Sluice Weave
 Okay

 Lets go
 An octopus
 Were getting into the water and well
just either hold on to the back or if we have
rope on the dock Ill just tie four foot
 There you go
 Yeah were literally back here as a
safety net so dont fret
 Beau Point us in the direction that your
boyfriend alluded to
 In the water
  Go fuck yourself
 While hes doing that can I pop my head
underwater and look around just make sure theres
no anything coming around
 
  down  across  up
 I think thats a good place to start
However if you wanted to test your strength I
would be very careful Remember it was an intake
so you could get down there and all of a sudden
the suction and the water would make it very
difficult for you to back out
 Im just saying it could be unpredictable
It could turn on turn off
 Okay who is going down
 Yeah it does
 What about the damn puppy
 Beaus holding onto a lead line
 Big breath 
 Ill take it
 Oh shit really
 Fuck
 Did not think that was going to work
 Damn

the grate gone Im going to come back out and
make my way up towards the boat to let them know
they made it through
 Yeah they made it through the second
grate

 The bottom rope is tied to the bottom so

an anchor or a moor

I dont actually need to see them
 Im going to use my last of two spell
slots to cast Hunger of Hadar  feet into the
hallway with just the brim just so it gets the
yeah
 So I pop in the doorway and I reach up
and grab a little bit of reality and I tear a
black hole in the hallway
 Yup
 You aint going nowhere motherfucker
 Everything in it is black So theyre
blinded they cant hear anything
  dex save or they take d cold damage
 Six seven so seven points
 Yep
 Algar does Yeah
 Nope
 Yes Yeah Im going to use the rest of
my movement to just come back out here
 Like the flowers she collects
 Nice Every little bit counts
 We dont
 I dont think he was clear on that
 And when you drown do you then have three
death saves or
 Or are you dead Or just two rounds

 For two more rounds
 Dude I was sweating
 I forgot something When Algar starts his
turn you take d cold damage So he was
 Yeah Hell be at two instead of one
 I did
 d
 For both of the bodyguards
 Five points of acid damage
 Sorry full damage Full damage
 They do take if they do their dexterity
saving throw they take half Again It says that

 You can do it every turn
 In the belly of the beast
 Ooh by one
 And cold damage hurts more
 Oh yeah sorry
 
 Oh right Thats a natural  plus four
 Do we get knocked back by the jets
 So would dropping Hunger of Hadar be an
action
 You just drop it
 Okay Im going to use my speed to enter
the hallway Five ten  before I get to the thing
 Do you need to get out of waterfuck
 You know what Fuck those guys Im going
to stay right where I am where I can still see
the water thing and Ill send two Eldritch Blasts
toward the water where Clay is I dont give a
fuck about Algar
 No
 Okay because youre in it
 But if I hit the wave itll hit them
 Lets
 Lets not do that Im going to drop
Hunger of Hadar and Im going to send two Eldritch
Blasts at both of the bodyguards
 That is a  for the first one
 And  on the second one
 Nice
 That is ten points of damage
 Five ten  and Ill use the rest of my
 feet to get as close as I can
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yep
 I have a question for you after her turn
 Lets think about whats important here
 I have a question
 So it says no action when you slay a
humanoid you can cause its spirit to rise as a
specter that gains three temporary hit points
 It says no action
 Once a long rest So can I do that for the
bodyguard that I just slayed
 Ill just reach forward and say
 Let none
pass
 I didnt know it was going to do that
 Do not move
  Come back to the water
park
 Yes
 Yeah Fucking True Lies 
 No the Szundie
 Fuck
 Ooh yeah
 You should just kill him because hes
never going to work again
 What is there to live for
 Ooh thats a good roll Not what you
want to hear
 I look down at Algar and say Im only
going to say this once Unless you want to end up
like your friend here Im going to need that
bracelet
 Im going to cut his hand off and take the
bracelet
 No Ill take the bracelet off
 Im going to cut his hand off

 With advantage This will be fine 
thats even better 
 Drift up towards us
 Not if I put that fucking slap bracelet
on
 He is
 I dont think so Might be unwise
 Yeah I want that bracelet Ill reach
down and pick it up
 Ill hold it in front of his face You
used this to control that
 Thats a 
 Well it depends on how forthcoming you
are Anything I need to know to operate this thing
or I just slap it on and start giving commands
 Indeed The hour is nigh
 May I ask how you came to be enslaved in
this predicament in the first place
 How about an answer for the bracelet
 Thats right you do
 Im sorry to hear that I never like to
see a creature put under the boot of somebody else
for their gain Ill toss him the bracelet
 Actually if you wouldnt mind we have
further need
 Not even five minutes Perhaps if he can
tell us the safe way out of here in exchange for
letting us have our way with Algar he could be on
his way and we can have our time
 But I dont want to kill Algar
 I do not Nope
 Hand up one sec Yeah Im saying
 Dont
kill Algar
 I want to know if theres other booby
traps
 Im not sure yet
 Algar
 Ill give him a little cheek slap
 Ill tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my
sleeve and Ill wrap it around his forearm like a
tight tourniquet
 
 Silversilt
 Im pretty sure
 Oh
 Thank you
 Nope no I just forgot he was there
 Actually Algar might need a quick
 No
 Yeah
 I like that Plus theyre guards its
their duty to fight which they did and we
defended ourselves
 I feel like
 Well make it pretty quick
 Yep
 If we want to be really careful there are
other places to stay
 I think were going to listen to your
influence on this one Jester it is closest to you
 No
 No hard plans Well lets wake up this
son of a bitch
 Yeah well get answers
 Yeah thats it
 Ill bring the tip of the falchion right
under his chin You know before we begin we got
this thing about calling out yelling really
sensitive eardrums so lets not do that
 Back unconscious
 Ill lean over to Nott and say
 Nott do
me a favor and make sure hes not carrying
anything fancy in his pockets
 What was your job down here and why were
you giving commands to that creature with this bracelet
 Who do you report to
 Marquis
 Yeah not LePual
 Demesne
 The creature that was here and the magic
used to control him is that something that you
brought to the table or was that a device given
to you and known in the higher ranks of government
 One of two cities
 And the other would be
 Right What else do you do here in
Nicodranas What do you do to pass the time
Algar Im trying to decide whether or not to hand
you over to this fearsome beast over here and I
point to  Caleb
 Ill make you into a jacket
 You have any significant others in the
city
 Agreed I think we all know The Ruby of
the Sea far and wide Think shed miss you if you
went missing
 Yeah
 Especially if you start to admit that you
did it all yourself Ill use Mask of Many Faces
to look just like him
  Who the fuck are you
 
 You know what Im feeling like Beau That
I just need to get out of this city and never come
back go somewhere far away I hold up also a
stump because my hand is missing I need to go
in a boat and just go
 Maybe a haircut maybe a new name too
What do you think
 All depends on how we decide to act as we
get out of here Im sure you know a very safe way
to the surface yes
 Shall we
 Just walk out with handless bagged man
 Jorge any traps contraptions we should
be aware of as were heading out
 How far away is the other container for
the other I assume creature under the same
restraints we saw here He mentioned going to free
his compatriot
 Oh I thought there were two under
Nicodranas
 I was okay with the rolling blackouts in
Nicodranas but two cities I feel a little worse
about A little worse Theyll figure it out
 Theres a mage tower that goes up and
down This place will be fine
 Well Jorge why dont you show us the way
out
 Predick or postdick
 Just a moment Were going to need those
keys
 Now Im sure it goes without saying that
once you leave this place if you yell or act a
fool in any way we will tear you asunder before
you can say Ow
 Yeah
 Thats a bitch
 What do you guys think I feel like I need
to partake on this voyage today Dont you think
 Almost ASAFP Right
 It was a nice day earlier
 You want to do that
 Shouldnt have been a dick
 Where
 I dont think it has a shore
 Lets send him to Marquet
 There you go
 Nice
 You want to put back one of those
platinums
 Let me get that part 
 Any boat
 That ring of keys that he gave us

approximately how many keys are on that thing
 Yes And I plan to betray all of the
citys secrets to your foes if I ever return
Itll be very smart to kill me on sight

 I didnt dismiss it
 You mean as we go outside outside
 Go back inside the room
 Remember we dont want anybody to like
him when he comes back
 You can go
 Christ its a letter just fucking write
it and send it
 Okay
 No were all back together now
 Well I feel like that kind of went about
as well as it could have
 What do we do now
 See who
 We could do both
 Sabian was
 Me
 Lets make our way back towards the
 Jesus Christ
 Yep Ive got to take more organized
notes Maybe we can stop by the fancy tower on the
way back
 Sure About what time is it
 Right you said that
 No bigs
 Im tapped I cant do anything
 Yeah
 It doesnt bother you that it grows taller
as you get closer
 No doors
 Oh shit
 Yeah
 Thats not true this is your home Its
where youre from
 Yeah we have time
 Were going to tell the truth about that
 I would be glad to
 With tiefling horns and tail coming out of
it

 Hey man if youve got Fireball
 Yashas going to rush up and aid Beau in
trying to pull Marius towards the docks

 We need to get onto the boat and get out
of here
 Yes
 Yes
 Im fine
 Hes going to go hang with the Ruby
 Yashas going to run her ass onto the
boat Double dash if she needs to
 Right and she will assume the Dodge
whatever in case they throw fire or something at her
 Im going to Arnold Schwarzernegger from
True Lies run and jump off the dock and dive into
the water heading straight towards the boat in a
straight line because my speed is the same on land
or in the water and I will double dash to the
boat
 Ill be like Were getting the fuck out
of here Shove off
 Are we tied up too
 I set the boat on fire and kill us all

 Bury our shame
 This was just fucked from the first

 Okay
 We want to pull up the anchor or are we
moving yet
 With her movement shell stand in front
of Marius like a human shield From any arrows
that might be coming
 Do I get an attack of bitch slapping
 I go up and I kick Marius in the water
no

 I dont fucking know Can I double dash
down into the bow of the or belowdecks where
Caleb is
 Ill do that
 Do I have an action or did I double dash
to get down here
 Oh Ill use my bonus action to cast
Hexblades Curse on that Enforcer With the hope
that he will soon be dead
 Im going

 Yeah I know yeah
 It misses
 It hits
 Nope
 Im uncon No Ill use my Relentless
Enfucking
 Well Im up to one hit point
 Just out of pitys sake Im disappointed
I came back up to one hit point
 In myself yeah
 Is that already halved because of raging
 Youre right that would fall Yeah
 Oh she did
 The docks on fire for crying out loud
 Yashas going to turn and bear hug
Marius
 Awesome Shes going to assume the dodge
Is there anything else to do
 Does Yasha know boats
 I mean I suppose she could run over to
the gangplank and she could try to pull it and
shove it against the dock and push off
 
 Ill back up to the top of the ship where
I should be useful
 Do I have an action
 Ill climb up onto where the rudder is
 I start turning the bow of the ship out
towards the sea
 Im smashing my head into the fucking
bow
 I fall unconscious When I wake up this
will all be over I do that
 Yes I do
 I do it
 No thats fine Frustrations good
enough
 Frustrations fine
 No thats appropriate for today
 Oh right you dont know how to sail the
ship
 Hoist the thing and then the other one
 Ooh the mage A mage or the mage
 Oh Yashas
 Yasha assists Beau in getting the ship
 Keeping an eye out for Caduceus start to
steer the ship along the coastline this way
 
 No fuck that guy Wheres Caduceus
 Just sail Yep just sail
 As she put her hands up he can see her
flexing biceps
 Nobodys going down there to help Jester
 Toll the Dead
 It Wasnt My Intention
 the name of this
episode
 With an I or a Y
 Yeah
 Would it mean anything if we said that we
come bearing gifts and that we are looking to see
the Captain Ill reach behind my hand and use
Minor Illusion and create a little replica of the
cat eye sphere and hold it out in front of him
 From who
 What are your ambitions with it
 Have we patted him down
 Were not sure yet
 Tighten them and tie him to the mast will
you
 Shove it back in

 Maybe there will be lunch meats down there
and we can make a sandwich

 Oh First pet down
 Hes eating mice
 Or hes chasing the ship and he cant
catch up
 That map is gorgeous
 He didnt even make an attack
 The recap really sticks it in and turns
it
 Yeah Im at the helm Is there anybody
down below seeing about that
 Yeah I was going to say Im at the helm
Beau if youll stay with me We need to
 We need to check the ship for damages
because we tried to blow it up a couple of times
and then if the rest want to head down and see
whats below
 Any chance you want to come up and help
me I pull a big piece of splintered wood out of
my forehead throw it over to the side In time
Im good
 Thanks
 Ill bark out
 Make sure the sails are
open tighten all the everything off and then
check the exterior of the ship if you can just for
breaks in the wood fire marks any damage that
you can see
 More dope
 Nice
 Less fancy will actually do us some good
in these waters so thats good
 Give it a little flick
 Fuck me Oh god Help
 Oh jesus christ

 Oh my god
 Fuck
 Well be listening to him lift that rocking
chair outside
 Oh yes Matthew Do us right Ooh
 Yeah great fucking call
 Its a cluster out in the Lucidian Ocean
 Jesus Maybe I jump overboard
 Another one what
 When he gives descriptions and we dont
fucking writes notes it bites us in the ass
 Kind of appropriate
 Thats a big promotion for him Carpenter
to first mate
 Time of dayish
 Oh shit
 Straight out from shore full sail Just
trying to put distance between us and the coast
 I know we have time to decide on our
route
 Ooh sports car Where is Marius
 Not to put you too at ease navigating was
never really my thing either Im better than
most but I do need to decide on where were
going
 If we want to use Marius were going to
have to wake his ass up and ask him some questions
 Yeah wake him up
 Not 
 Yeah probably not Listen well let you
go back to your slumber right quick Where were
you headed with this ship I assume to meet up
with Avantika yeah
 Right But now weve changed your plans
yes Youre with us
 And Avantika needs the sphere correct
 No but I do Do you know where she is
Ill reach behind my back and use Minor Image
again and show the sphere
 Who were you going to give this to
 Right
 Shadycreek Run Where we were You
wouldnt happen to know where Jawgrasp called
home would you Or where he was heading next
 Do you feel comfortable on a ship
 We are kind of limiting him Hes got big
poofy sleeves and everything hes not going to
swim anywhere
 You could rid him of that I hear sleeves
are
 Hey welcome to the crew of the well
well have to rename this thing And Ill summon
the falchion and just swipe through the ropes
 Oh pal
 That seems unnecessarily adept
 I cant tell I dont know Is he an innocent
middleman that doesnt know what hes
shipping or is it just
 Listen what were going to ask for is
that you be as forthcoming as you possibly can be
Would you mind walking over to the side of the
ship there and tell me how far Nicodranas looks
right now
 Yeah Cant see it can you Stuck with
us So Im going to need everything that comes out
of your mouth to be the truth
 My goodness he is very sensitive about
this Im just trying to set the tone for the ship
 Do me a favor Go below decks and try and
find us some drink will you
 Jeez yeah seriously
 Are they coming up
 Oh
 No kidding
 Axhead is
 About the sphere
 One
 I certainly feel like I have gained
abilities yeah I dont know though Is this
where they were headed
 This is a map to a reef I know the reefs
of the Lucidian Ocean this is very familiar
 Yeah well otherwise you wreck the ship
 Well theres the Everplume Reef theres
the Torrid Reef but this looks like the Inkclaw Reef
  That was less 
 There are a lot Therere quite a few
 There are a few reefs that protect certain
islands One of which is the Darktow Isle
 You dont want to go there
 That would narrow it to two in my mind If
its in the Lucidian Ocean One is far northwest
of the Darktow and one is more straight east by
several hundred miles
 What am I after Well Id like to see I
keep saying Avanteeka but its
 I want to know what she wants the sphere
for I want to know why Vandren had it in the
first place What else are they looking for Does
it have a brother sister sphere I dont know
 No I do This doesnt look like Darktow
to me Darktow is more in a U shape You really
have to go around the whole damn thing to get in
without touching the reef Its a pain in the ass
 No that sounds great to me
 You wouldnt let her do that would you
 We have plenty of time its quite a
distance away So it could either be the Deep Row
Reef or it could be the Inkclaw Reef
 Fair enough Well have plenty of time I
could well we have to pick one Ones to the
northwest and ones down to the southeast from
where we are now
 If you want we do have the stars on our
side so well be able to navigate easier We could
drop sail and
 Oh youre going to be so helpful in
this Youre the ships navigator I dub thee
The Mist navigator
 The what The Mistake
 Do I remember if the Deep Row or the
Inkclaw one is closer than the other
 My knowledge is limited to what Ive
journeyed through before The Inkclaw is closer
we could try there at least set course for that
direction How does that sound
 Yeah we could do it
 Yes if nothing else to look out for other
ships
 Ill tell you what we could do Theres a
joint stop on the trade routes an island called
Brokenbank we could make it there Im familiar
with how we would get there and we could try and
find some extra hands
 Almost oneandahalf times the distance I
think ish
 Yeah Ive never sailed directly to the
Inkclaw Reef I just know where it is because Ive
seen maps
 Yeah we could return to somewhere else
along the Nicodranas or Port Damali
 I didnt mean for that to go the way it
did
 Yeah its not looking good for us right
now
 Ill call out to Beau as shes walking
off
 Hows it looking down there Spirits
high

 Okay no I thought Id ask How are you
feeling
 Yeah I dont feel very good
 Its been a day right
 We were going to talk to Algar we ended
up killing his bodyguards and setting that thing
free and then we were going to go and talk to
Marius and then we ended up killing the whole
fucking crew and captain minus one
 Why didnt we just go talk I feel like
weve abandoned the use of heres my thing
right Magics new to me this sword is new to me
I didnt have most of this all of my life All I
had was my words to get out of situations to try
and heal conflict to try and outsmart somebody
Now all of a sudden I have this power and I feel
like its a shortcut and that Ive been cheating
myself I dont feel like Ive put forth the same
effort to resolve something because I can just
will something into happening That doesnt seem
right to me
 How does Caleb feel about all this
 Oh really
 I dont know just doesnt sit right
Hows Caduceus
 That was actually very profound
 I get that Maybe we try not to do that I
check you you check me We check the group
Otherwise I feel like Caduceus is not going to be
the last person that thinks about
 Yeah
 We need to decide on a destination
whether we turn around and Were we in the Open
Quay or were we in the Wayfarers
 Were in the Wharf
 The Restless Wharf We can turn around and
come back to the Open Quay or where the
Wharfmaster was and try and get in and out real
fast with some crew or we can head to Port
Damali or we can head out to the open sea but we
do need to pick a destination
 Caduceus Oh bosun
 We dont have any guns Theres not guns
or powder
 Yes
 Caduceus thank you for making all this
We need to decide on a destination Were going to
need more hands that are able to figure out where
we are going next
 Not those docks We could go to a separate
landing site
 Port Damali
 We could turn around and try to go to
the Where was the wharfmaster The dwarf Ingus
 Ignus
 Its a different section of the city
 Hiring a crew
 Fuck I dont know
 Not a ton
 Our quickest bet is just to turn back
into What area was the wharfmaster Ignus in
 It was the Restless Wharf
 Thats gone real well for us in the past
 hours but go ahead
 Yeah could you do this in a night
 Sure Although the more time that passes
the longer word has to spread
 Were a little deep for an anchor
 Sure Lets go in circles  miles off
coast well just go in circles
 In shifts you can navigate in a pattern
yeah
 Yes I dont know Either one of those is
fine
 Yeah I vote for sailing up outside of the
wharfmaster area taking a little skiff in just
getting some crew and getting the fuck out of
here
 Id keep the ship out of there just in
case the Zello the Jello
 Zhelezo have come up and said exaggerated
accent There was a ship and the Fireball
detonated on the side of it and ours has a bunch
of burn damage
 I dont The splinters are in my
forehead
 Ill go second
 It does not
 Its going to be a giant dick and balls if
we do
 Okay
 How you doing
 Oh Yeah thats a good way to deal
 A plan
 I have a series of expectations but I
wouldnt call it a plan
 Im in pursuit of something and I know what
maybe the next couple of steps are but past that
 Heavy
 I take it you havent seen much combat
 You ever fought a giant water genie
 Me neither Never even seen one before
 Yeah Well yeah my new life pretty
much yeah Its open
 Yasha
 What makes you say that
 Yeah Do you naturally have the ability to
feel that out of people
 Its very insightful
 For your job
 When theyre grieving
 You seem to pick up on the stuff thats
not said
 Otherwise I dont really know what Id be
doing
 Fair enough Okay
 Ill give you advantage
 I think well expand our travel pattern to
skate out wider
 We dont necessarily want to own that
here they are very stern about mistakes
 I agree with that
 Move on
 I think thats wise
 Well make our way up to the docks where the
wharfmaster is which is a separate docks from where
 Remember it took a while to walk from one
to the other And were only taking the skiff in
 And only people that dont look like us
can take the skiff in to get the crew that were
going to look for
 What The Mistake
 Can I
 Okay lets try to forge a pink slip for
the Mistake
 I am an actor in real life you should
probably ask Matt
 They dont even have to board us because
were going to stay out in the river Were just
taking the skiff in
 How about we get into the docks first so
we can get some crew
 I should probably stay on the ship
 Do you know how to move the ship if you
need to all of a sudden
 Then Ill stay on the ship You guys go
on take a big bunch of money go get the crew
What is the argument to that
 Youre not
 Ill write a list
 Listen last time the only guy who could
move the ship was below deck Im not leaving my
wingman Im not making this mistake a second
time
 No Im staying on the ship
 Yeah youll stay with me Ill make you
the little lackey that moves shit
 Ill keep Marius and Ill keep Gallan
 I dont know A quarter mile off the
coast A couple hundred yards I dont know how
close do you get to the ship if you want to take
the skiff in
 I know I wished Id picked an astronaut
Then I wouldnt be fucked

 Which I do because I want to punish
them
  yards
 Based off the last game right
 What if a Zhelezo ship comes around and
arrests Yasha We can at least get
 We drop sail we take off and I leave you
guys in the cove
 Yep
 
 This is very complicated
 I have not really seen
 What would the point be Because the
wharfmaster thats all he looks at
 Im open to all fucking suggestions I
just wanted to park a boat and go get some crew
 The filigree on the borders Theres
little nut sack
 Lets take it into dock Against all the
advice of zhelezo looking for a burned ship that
had a Fireball
 Blackened charred wood on the outside of
it in a sphere shape
 I like it Lets go into the dock I love
this plan
 Nope this is an adventuring party Lets
go into the dock
 The one that we were not just killing
people at
 We will tell Marius and Gallan to stay
below the entire time
 And Yasha
 The wharfmaster Ignus
 You want me to do it
 Sure Ill go find that guy with five
gold
 Yes Were trying to get in and out of
port as fast as we can looking to acquire a few
crew members Would you do me a favor though
telling any inquiring minds that weve been here
for awhile and that were coming from
 The Mistake thats correct yes and we
are coming over from what was the port in
between Port Damali and this one
 Yeah were out of Port Zoon and were
just trying to get there and back in the same
day if we can
 
 Is there a posting for people looking for
crew positions A sign
 Okay
 Ill tell them the amount of supplies that
I think they need to pick up for a months worth
of travel
 Seven No six Crew of six
 We need a boatswain Well weve got the
cook We need a quartermaster we need a
navigator and a captain If we dont need a cook
or a carpenter
 Sweet Lets call it a crew of five
 Captain navigator quartermaster cook
and another boatswain slash barrel keeper
 Me
 Ten
 Yep
 Yep
 No were at the docks right now
Well go to the Seafloor Bounty first
 We never know we might kill them so
 Jason Voorhees Jester
 Thats all right go get them We dont
look like ourselves
 Me apparently
 We were hoping your services werent
spoken for
 Few weeks At the most maybe only a
couple
 A week
  gold a week
 
 We can accommodate that
 Well then yeah
 Yes
 Just keep him around
 Youre off the boat
 Why do they call it the Inky Claw
 Because we have this map and we have a
navigator that doesnt mean that we can go from
one destination on a map that we saw to another
We still need to follow the trade routes right
 Yeah if we stay on the trade route we
have to go here and then down and then come
across or we go here
  Do crows swim
 Well I want to make everyone aware of the
dangers okay If we take the trade route it will
take three and a half times longer to get there
than if we just go from Point A to Point B But
Point A goes across uncharted waters and on this
map there are giant tentacles coming out of the
water probably just for flavor
 Could just be artists interpretation to
try and fill in blank space doesnt mean anything
 Nicodranas and the Inkclaw is down to
your lower right hand corner
 Theyre like little sea cucumbers
 We also have this map which is at the top
of the Inkclaw Reef that will guide us through
the reef Instead of coming this direction and
then down and underneath which is what you would
probably be doing
 All right Well instruct Orly
 Put what in The map
 Is that a goblin thing
 Were going to instruct Orly to navigate
from north to south to the top of the reef using this
 We are trying to catch up with a captain
that we need to make contact with
 I think they might yep
 Caduceus are you excited about these
haunted stories
 Whereas he still hasnt found what hes
looking for
 Never has there been a more worthless
perception check
 To Nugget or your mom
 Sure Ten
 Mmhmm
 Yeah theyre beautiful
 Last thing you want to is jump in there
though That is a bad time
 Yeah jellyfish sting and its quite
painful
 No No Im more anxious to get there My
curiosity I suppose overrides my fear
 No I dont think I had gotten that far
Plus I have the sphere Captain Avantika doesnt
 I feel like we take care of ourselves
pretty well
 Thank you
 Sad
 Yeah I suppose I get sad Are you sad
Jester
 Im sometimes sad about the things that I
had before that I wont have anymore I sometimes
wish that things were different What makes you
sad
 I am sorry that we left in the way that we
did Would your mom ever think of leaving Nicodranas
 Right What would you want for her To
stay there and grow old or
 Thats very noble of you Yeah
 Well how about on some of these islands
Ive heard that there is treasure
 Hard to find Im not making any promises
but if we play our cards right and we take care of
each other we might return a bit wealthier than
we left
 Or give it to your mom and have her go
find The Gentleman but shes just amazing
 Yeah Dont be sad Your mom is very proud
of you that much was clear
 Dont mention it
 They decided not to kill us
 Of course he is
 Nice Solid
 I saw right next to the cut your own keys
booth next to the dock there was a
rentacaptain He would sit there with a corncob
pipe and hes like Argh me is a
 My captain name
 Captain Captain Tusktooth
 Nope You never want to see them
 Natural 
 Lower the inboard motor Fire at
 Really one ounce
 One ounce One inch punch
 Ill take the last watch Is it at night
at all
 You can talk to them but they cant talk
back
 Ill hand off the wheel to someone and
Ill go down to the side of the ship and Ill
summon the falchion
 With not a lot of people on the deck
paying attention hopefully can I reach over the
side and dip the tip of the sword into the ocean
 Does the eye do anything
 Okay Ill summon it back
  From whence it came
 Mmhmm
 Ooh seven
 Professor Thaddeus
  Ill sound a general alarm
 There was something that took off from the
mast it had wings
 It was pretty large right
 I dont know I didnt see its too
dark
 Yasha had 
 Have they already slashed the sails
 
 Ill aim two Eldritch Blasts up at one of
the two harpies thats flying up above the mast
  on the first one
 And the second one is ooh 
 That is oh shit where is the d
Ten
 Nope no Sorry I was calling that out
like an idiot  points of damage on the first
one and seven points of damage on the second
one
 Thats it
 Theres only three left right
 I thought there were only five
 Oh the song broke it didnt die
 Didnt we say we werent going to try and
solve things with fists
 
 Yeah
 Did you do that on purpose
 Shit
 Throw the sword no
 Fuck
 Bugging out
 Oh smart
 Since when
 Do you have any medicine for him
 Well get at it
 Just cup his nose just 
 Ja sure
 Caleb always pretending hes hurt
 You know how much that hurts
 Do you want to lead the prayer
 He could be on the edge of life and maybe
the prayer
 Was that I thought it was Jesters
healing
 I just watched
 How do we prevent further heart episodes
from
 More friendship
 Beau go give Caleb a hug
 Like a Voldemort hug
 Hows that sail coming Jester
 Are we putting limits on your cuisine
Taliesin
 Start something
 Start moving his feet and his eyes stay in
the same place
 Are you listening underneath the boat
Using your sonar
 I dont know why I keep volunteering for
fucking perception 
 
 Excellent  Well lets prepare
to navigate through it
 I just picked it as a backstory I didnt know
Id need to know fucking anything about sailing Jesus
 These are survival checks
 
 Got to use the dodeca
 Thats a ten
 Survival is minus two for me
 Not very wise
 Theres not a hit point counter on the
wheel Thats ticky tock
 Yeah One and two Were on the third
 Natural 
 
 I have no idea
 Abandon ship
 Sure Ill drag that out and jump over the
side and try and push up against the hole
 Yeah
 Im thrilled We can still go underwater
though right
 I throw the mattress in I jump in after
it and I try and go under
 I press it against the outside of the ship
and hope the current 
 
 Ill take the sword shove it no Im
just kidding
 Yeah
 I say from outside the boat
 Yeah
 Ill let it go
 Ill tug on the line and get myself pulled
back up into that boat
 Yeah
 We got to get the crows nest out of the
boat
 Yes weve done the final turn so we
could try and push towards the island but were
going to have to beach it
 Whats your spell do
 Weve approached the island We have
another boat
 What
 But I think its daytime right
 If we can see them they can see us
 I will try to increase our speed towards
the island in the direction away from them and
aim to get on the island if we can
 It just depends on where the ship was if
it was directly ahead of us or towards the north
or the south wed obviously go the opposite way
 Were going to the southern tip
 Were going to ground this ship Were
going straight into the beach and were going to
run our asses into the fucking jungle
 I dont know Were not there yet
 I throw Nott overboard Full sail
 I grab her and bring her back No Im
just kidding
 Oh yeah
 Mmhmm
 Yep Does it have some trap doors on the
side of the
 Yeah why not
 Weve got the gray wave one
 Uhhuh
 I use Mask of Many Faces to make myself
look like Captain Jawgrasp You lower the flag
and hmm Fuck I dont know Jesus Christ
 Yeah fuck it were going to beach the ship
Were just going to keep driving towards the island
 Yep
 How far are we Thats another question
 Oh no no nevermind No Well slow down
the ship a little
 Okay yeah Well lower the flags slow
the ship
 Mmhmm
 Cool Lets lower the rope ladder over the
side and welcome them aboard
 I can what
 Oh I dont know if he did that so lets
not
 Yep
 Yes
 I mean yeah
 Yeah
 Parlay
 Yeah I think it will be a parlay
unfortunately
 Well I dont know who these people are
what kind of ship theyve come in on I mean this
can go one of two ways either very amicably or we
all die
 Oh I dont know Do we have a spyglass
onboard this ship Lead anything
 I said a spyglass and you pulled out a
bird
 Oh theyre that close
 Yeah so Im going to look like the
halforc captain Was I close enough to hear him
talk when he was on the dock
 Shit fuck balls ass Okay so Im going
to make myself look like him
 Yeah I know we dont have to relive it
 Can I reply to that message
 Were about to be boarded by fucking
pirates


 Can I make myself look like the Captain
Jawgrasp but can I put like a bloody bandage
around my throat as if I suffered a wound and
Ill talk like this
 Okay
 Well I mean not that youre already
really super dangerouslooking but maybe you
could like menace it up a little bit
 Im going to roll a perception check
 Yeah no hold on I know the name

 Yeah Im going to tell Beau to go
activate the windlass and lower the anchor
 The windlass
 Yeah and well make sure that flag is
nice and high that had the gray
 
  Actually funny you mention
sinking our boat Sustained some damage so if I
could request of the captain perhaps some grace
while we go into shore Im afraid if we try to
make it to her ship we might be on the bottom of
the ocean
 Yes my throat its all fucked up
 Okay
 
 Yeah heavy casualties Yeah The
butchers bill was very steep yep
 It would seem that way

 But these are battlehardened men and
women every one of them
 Jesus Do you think you can accommodate
seven of us on your two craft
 Do we
 We have a rowboat

 We will accompany you to The Squalleater
 Ill turn to the rest of the crew and be
like just do whatever she he she says
 Nott make sure that Caleb comes with us
Hes awful grumpy below decks He needs to be on
the part of the boat with us
 Yeah go get fucking Caleb
 Hes a terrifying fighter Just make sure
hes on the boats
 No good at these
 That poor bastard
 Coming out of the gun port

 Ill go first
 No thats not right at all
 Sure Yep I mean yes
 Oui

 We suffered heavy damage and casualties
but we have returned successful
 Oh yes we actually came under such heavy
heat we had to rebrand the ship as The Mistake
 Yeah Yep We came across some new crew
May I introduce
 Tracy Bowman Next to Tracy you will
see
 Phillip is a talented bosun May I also
introduce the tall and powerful
 Hes a talented cook that one What was
your name again
 Corneli yeah the food just blows your
mind
 Well you see we now know the location of
the artifact you seek Its as good as ours
 Oh god
 Its real sore
 All part of the plan
 Well I must commend you on your
perceptiveness My balls are quite large

 I will drop the mask
 That is a wonderful story One that I
would love to share You have the honor of being
in the company of The Mighty Nein

 Its a long story but Im afraid we wont
be able to tell it or further converse unless we
have an atmosphere of equal exchange here and
this hostile act is not a step in the right
direction Captain
 Yes
  Gilligone Hon hon
 Indeed
 Oh yeah

 Its also got a giant fucking ogre on it
now
 Get your hat out of the way
 Well I imagine there must be a hefty
reward for the item that you seek We went through
great troubles just to acquire it
 Perhaps
 Yep

 Fjord
 Its actually Captain Tusktooth but

 Cornelius what say you in this highly
delicate matter
 That is not necessary We would absolutely
love to prove our loyalty in your service
 Its a resounding yes of course
 By all means
 Vera

 Oh Jesus
 Yeah yeah
 Ill make my way over to Janet Yasha and
take her by the arm and say you okay with this
 If I ask her about it Let her know that I
dont know anything
 Oh you dont think shed believe me
 Thats a fine idea Yeah like I hoard the
information
 Very small ship Yeah Work your magic
 Not making any movements to move the ship
its just staying
 Yeah I third that question So what I
have worked out is that we have what she needs we
got to try and find out as much as we can about
why she wants it and what it does where does she
want it for herself or is she taking it somewhere
Thats about all I got
 Yeah Oh shit is Marius LePual back on
the other ship
 That poor bastard Oh shit our fucking
tortle
 They better not sink
 I like Orly Yeah okay
 Fair enough I feel like we can make some
ground without fighting if we have to I feel like
we can find out what we need and maybe slip away
I think thats a great idea
 No I kind of fucking like it actually
 How about in the meantime keep an eye on
the people around right Watch what theyre doing
The things theyre doing on the mast Rigging
right Try and familiarize yourself with working a boat
 If you can
 Sure yeah our partners
 Yes Sapphire
 More of the what
 This is mine I earned this And its not
actually in the game
 Itll be our pleasure
 Yeah mind if we partake of your beautiful
spread here Is there food in this bitch
 
 Thats a candle thats a candle Stop
eating the candle

 No put it back

 Outside the door
 Is it essentially us and the captain
 If you dont mind my asking
 Tusktooth
 Yes
 I know If I could you seem so anxious
When was the last time the item was in your
possession Im so excited to reunite you with it
I feel like if you tell us your story well share
in that sense of triumph
 Youre correct I have it on very good
authority that an island that is surrounded by the
Deeprow Reef is housing the item you seek
 

 I do
 I do Fuck I picked the one reef that
doesnt have any goddamn islands She doesnt know
that and Im not saying this out loud
 Yeah yeah Oh uncharted islands Lets
not do that

 If you make your way to the Deeprow Reef
right off the shores of Vide Cay youll find an
unguarded old ruined fort There the item is
being protected and held
 Well you see Marquis LePual let us know
that you were in dire need of it and that there
was heavy coin and glory in its delivery Now as
you can see I lost my original crew and found
these bunch of fuckwits You see I do owe them a
little bit of coin for their trouble and I sure
would hate to leave them emptyhanded Plus I want
to see what happens when youre reunited with your treasure
 Perhaps

 Captain I hope you understand that this
is not my first rodeo If I were to tell you
everything that I know right now why would you
need me alive
 Thats what I heard
 Great pizza place
 No no no take it easy
 It sure as fuck doesnt Could you say
that again slower
 Stay away from the captains cheese
 Do you know what that means
 I dont know what the fuck that means
 No she is the chosen of
  Serpent
 So say we all Yeah
 Just a moment
 No
 Nott Im pretty sure youre not playing
this out all the way That shits in my body okay
 Bless you
 Did you all do that together
 The dreams
 I have dreams
 Shes not looking at me right Im a
 You have dreams Ive had dreams of
being deep underwater Theres a giant eye that
sees me I hear a voice speaking to me but I
cant reply Does that ring any bells
 Perhaps not Perhaps this is destiny I
must tell you I am very eager to see what this
leads to I havent been entirely honest

The item you seek does not lie on Vial Coa what
the fuck was it called Vide Cay It does not
reside there I have it protected in an alternate
dimension Ill use Minor Image to show the
sphere and make it disappear
 If we can work together I would like to
accompany you to this temple you speak of I would
like to see it find its resting place
 If whos plotted out the course to the
temple who
 Cosko
 Oh no no no
 As we turn to leave the cabin the
captains quarters a quick look of anything that
looks like info about where this temple is in
case she decides to fucking slit our throats in
the middle of the night
 Ugh a ten
 Awesome
 Everybody drink yeah Laura
 As were moving through can we clock sort
of whats being kept on the ship Are there cells
are there barrels are there packages of things
 Did we previously see what the flag they
were flying was and what it looked like I cant remember
 Can we do that now
 That fucking eye
 Yes
 It does
 But I dont want her to know that
 I cant know that for sure but I know
that as soon as she has it theres very little
reason to keep us around
 Caduceus
 Would you mind telling me did you feel
anything coming from the captain
 Well I dont know You seem to make these
strange comments about how people feel and stuff
Id have thought maybe you were like a
mindreader
 Lets pay attention next time shall we
Cool
 Oh good call
 I mean
 Well if
 No shame
 Ill tell you what I know and thats that
I see visions sometimes its been a long time
since Theres a giant eye and I hear a voice
speaking to me I dont know where it comes from
and I dont know where I am if its the past or
my future But I feel like it happened that night
when the ship exploded and before I found myself
on the shore with the sword I feel like those
things are all connected When I saw the sphere
it reminded me of that eye
 I am too
 I wouldnt say ongoing Its happened like
three or four times
 Sure three or four times Three
 Yeah
 Right
 Or I can summon the dragon

 I have been having them but I wouldnt
think to comment on them because theyre just
fucking dreams
 No
 Not to my knowledge
 Did I No youre right I have
undershared and Im sorry I just didnt think
it was relevant
 Well yeah fucking now
 Yeah Yasha I mean do you vomit after
you talk to the thunder
 Me neither it happened one time so
 Just the once
 Look I feel like if we can get on land
at least and some sort of landing party well
have a better shot Nott youre terrified of the
water I mean were on unfriendly ground I dont
mind trying to slip away or forcing our way out of
this situation but I sure would like a resolution
and at least a better place to stage some sort of
action than on an enemy boat
 Ship Ship its a ship
 Mizzenmast mainmast foremast I got it
ha ha ha

 No I just want to know where the temple
is I dont care if these people die
 No yeah no thats what I meant I know
you want to leave I do as well but we need to
play this game a little longer yeah
 Thats back up
 Whered the squid come from
 I heard serpent and leviathan Is
leviathan a giant squid
 I dont know if you can feel
 Yeah Im not comfortable doing that
 If you could be succinct Im a little
fucking ticklish okay
 
 Are we okay to play this out see how it
goes at least get on land and see if we can find
this temple this crazy bitch talks about
 Of her
 Yeah I think thats
 Vanity you say
 Were trying to do less of that
 Oh
 Do it
 Amazing
 Uhhuh
 Oh my god
 We all go down in a blaze of glory
 You fucking fuck
 But of course
 I do
 Oh motherfucker

 Oh my god
 Yep
 Captain I admit I too am very encouraged
to find someone that seems to have gone through
the same sort of visions and trials that I have
You said its been a long time since youve met
another chosen Are you saying youve met
previous I found myself feeling I was the only
one that was experiencing this vision
 The blessing you say I havent heard
speak blessing Ive heard words of encouragement
And your crew believes as you do
 I look forward to this very very much I
noticed as we were leaving your quarters that
beautiful iron piece above your doorway A snake
circling back upon itself the eye in the middle
but it seemed there were small eyes all around the
body of the snake
 That sounds
 Exactly the word I was searching for
Speaking of beautiful
 I was so taken by that marking that
tattoo you had I was wondering if you might show
it to me again
 Im uncomfortable with whats happening
Natural 

 Like a fucking eye or a tattoo of an
eye
 
 Oh god Fuck thats getting weird

Thats some Pan Labyrinths bullshit going
on  My my

 Fuck it I feel now you and I are more
connected than I couldve ever imagined Ill
summon the sword

 Perhaps it was Do you know what will
happen if we
 Do you know what will happen if we take
this sphere to the place of its choosing Have you
seen whats unleashed or have you only heard
 I admit I find myself very curious
 Three temples
 All of the same construct all looking for
the same what do you call it
 Same
 My god the sea

 What does the eye say to you Anything you
remember
 To consume
 I confess having spent so much time on
the water the command over it seems like too
great a gift to receive but I crave it

 Oh fuck

 Indeed
 We will all

 I will put my hand on hers and say
 We
will all need our rest for the trials to come
Thank you for sharing your story with me I dont
feel quite as alone in this
 Its like an onion you got to peel it
you know
 I turn and I head towards the door and as
I get there I look back

 And I walk away

 No thank you Where did that even come
from Thats okay Not much actually She is far
more under the influence of whatever this is than
I initially thought She took off her glove and
there was an eye in the palm of her hand And not
another tattoo I think it was like a fucking eye Ah
 Yeah I know So she showed me hers and I
showed her mine
 Eyes Our eyes On the sword
 I did not
 Fuck
 I didnt even think of that
 Yep
 What the fuck do you mean still

 Oh shit
 Yeah but you know
 Yep
 Yeah no youre right She actually said
there was one before that was also chosen
 Where was that fucking pigeon We didnt
get to that part but I feel like because I saw
my former captain Vandren with the same sphere
that he might be the one that she was talking about
 Theres a chance She said that this
temple that were about to visit was one of three
 Jester I dont think she killed Vandren
He was on the ship when it exploded I dont even
 No I understand Sabian my crewmate he
went down and sabotaged the ship He set off an
explosion That has to be what happened
 Well I think we were being pretty
respectful
 I do not Altar the little iron piece
above her doorway
 I saw that on the way out I dont do
anything like that I dont know what that would
 She did she said there was one other
chosen besides herself and now me
 I did the tattoo
 Have I seen that anywhere else
 Didnt Molly have

 Did he have any tattoos that had eyes in
them Like the peacock feathers
 What

 Sure
 Yeah Right
 Yeah I know
 She said we should all get some rest I
feel like weve earned some trust I feel like
well be in good hands I dont know if I entirely
trust her but I do feel like she is motivated to
see where this leads
LIAM Thats one way of putting it ja
 I will say she seems a bit on the
fanatical end She spoke of acquiring powers that
I cant even begin to comprehend Control over the
oceans and seas
 Or other follow
 But doesnt that sound like too much
 We will and in the meantime I would
suggest that we acted like we are as interested
and motivated to see this through as her
followers Otherwise I think well stick out
 No
 She does Unleashing things that are too
terrible to talk about but you can use your imagination
 Nope
 Youre not drawing like this youre
drawing like this
 Its the first time Ive heard of it I
mean it sounds incredible but I cant even begin
to fathom what that would be like That
responsibility I dont know who I would be if I
could wield something like that
 Understand it would be a start
 What urges
 Well Ive asked Beau to check me and Ill
check her on areas of aggression If I start
controlling the oceans and shit maybe well talk
about it
 Until then I can only tell you I only
want to know more about this and find out about
what happened to my friend Thats as far as Im
thinking
 Try to sleep
 Share with Tal
 No goddamn it
 No
 I climb those motherfucking stairs
 Ill fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast at
it
 Witch Bolt right to its chest
 The stairs are they staying the same is
there anything at the foot of the statue after
they break apart
 Ill move forward
 Ill summon the sword and hold the eye
facing the circle
 Void that eats the light Can I walk into
the center of the circle
 Well I definitely do now
 Yeah
 Is there a ceiling are there walls are
there statues in this space
 Watching Can I look into the eye of the
sword do I see anything
 What the fuck Can I try and take the edge
of the blade and press it into the floor
 Jesus  I dont know what
you want from me
 Ive stared at the eye Fuck I have no
idea
 Ooh 
 Ill let it go where its leading and
point it towards the floor
 Okay
 Sure Can I put my face in the water

 Can I look behind myself real fast
 A shit load of ships coming towards me
Cool Are there any pigeons in this dream

 
 Can I reach my hand out and try and
control the ships
 Yeah were going to go ahead and grab
whatever the fuck that is and pull it up
 Can I take both hands and do a coup de
grace two big  over the top
 Dont wake up dont wake up
  Yes
  What  No
no I didnt
 Yeah
 Yeah no we were fighting crazy beasts
and monsters and all this talk of serpents I feel
 
 I dont know Im so used to copying
people I get all sorts of stuff mixed up in my head
 Talk about the dream
 I mean its just a dream Whats there to
talk about
 First thing in the morning youre like 
Oh I know it was amazing Tell me more 
 I mean wait you guys didnt have any
dreams of a similar nature did you
 That is correct It is a pleasure to meet
you as well
 I would agree I think theyre quite
territorial We would do best to remain unseen
 No I havent Im
 No what was your comment
 They were like fish people not like snake
people
 I see where youre going
 Me
 It is a sigil of our group that is
sometimes viewed just to focus ones energy
 But I dont think I need it Im very
focused on the fucking job at hand and perhaps
someone needs help with like stealth you know
 Oh plus zero All right Ill look at
it

 Should have looked at that first
 Indeed
 Should be
 Take a bow
  Welcome to the jungle
 Ill be up front
 Yep
 Shes nice in the middle for a good
spread
 First roll with the new CR die
 Do you do that out loud
 The local greenery
 I dont need it but okay
 
 Caduceus can I ask you
 what do you hear
when you converse
  Yeah Im sorry
 No
 Nothing
 Oh
 Yeah and Caduceus please
 What the fuck Plus
 Why are you rolling perception checks
 Yeah Caduceus Nott want to check it out
 Yeah
 Such a good idea
 Just think slot machine
 Ding ding ding ding
  Save friends
 This is good This is some Uncharted
shit right now
 What golden snake
 Is it just a cobra head by itself or is there
also a body
 Yeah we can take ten minutes well set
out a little perimeter just to make sure we
deflect any unwanted
 Huh
 Why would we do that
 You certainly could I dont see what harm
it could bring
 Sure go for it
 Hes rolling dice you guys Is the shack
large enough to house our entire
 Well kind of
 I have a question for you Matt Is it
really just us and Avantika and Jamedi
 And thats it
 Yeah thats the humidity I walk over to
are dedicated to this cause as well How much do
you share with them
 Very effective
 Blind belief is quite remarkable Im
assuming youve shown them things to garner some
level of expectation of your abilities
 I dont doubt it for a moment
 I would expect nothing less
 Lets hope it doesnt come to that
 She just gets a finger full of sweat
 Are we satisfied
 All right
 Ill take it Is that advantage Better

 And sweet
 Of the what
 What the fuck
 You slick motherfucker
 Really Out of the fucking blue
 
 Somebody cast something right Does that
mean somebody cast something
 Im sorry did you say not quite
 Do you detect anything sinister
 Yeah thats inherent sure Right
 Thank you for letting me know I hope
youll keep an eye on it for us
 All right
 No I asked if she shared with her men her
passions and all the details that she knows and
all the knowledge I thought maybe she might covet
that but it seems like shes quite forthcoming
Shes trying to build a following like a zealot
almost You know build believers out of her crew
 Yeah Shes convincing if shes a liar I
think she genuinely wants to summon forth this thing
 That shes the chosen Yeah
 No Im fine Fine Rested REM sleep is
some of the best so you know I feel energized
Jazzed Excited to continue on
 Ghost stories Yeah
 Yep
 Wow Do you want to tell me whats in
peoples heads
 Admittedly
 Well I admit that Im not sure about a
lot of this No pressure right
 I will try to fill in as many details as I
can
 Totes
 You can see the temperature rising
 Shh
 Two people go up
 Thats a bad gesture
 Were staying put
 His big arms are five feet Like these
bigass
 You ever seen an anaconda mouth There are
lots of teeth in there Its real bad
 Three of the other party
 The other two only had eyes that seemed
off
 Were going to let them go
 The canopy of trees above right Theres
no sort of
 Its a new day
 Yeah you make a good point
 Ill join you Anybody else Everybody
else should stay at least   feet back
 Yasha should stay with the healers for
sure
 The whole time You me Jamedi and
Avantika in the front
 Is that all right
 Well Jester doesnt it glow
 Just be dark and not attract any other
attention
 I think maybe we invite them in and one of
us keeps out
 On who
 I just peed a little
 Come on snitch
 Oh my god
 We got ambushed
 How far away are you guys
 Oh shit That means theres probably more
than two
 Yeah
 Why would you make that
 And he is getting fucked up right now
 Both our healers are outside Typical
 Nobody
 Seven plus I got to get her sheet
 I think its nine
 Beau Caduceus
 Yasha has nine I have eight
 What
 Jealous Jealous of what
 I like it Get some of that shit back
 Atta boy
 Its like Avatar in the fucking
 Shit
 How many hit points do you
 We are in a total danger zone
and were taking strolls
 What On both Wow
 Yeah Yasha will use her full movement to
follow Avantika out of the bubble The Bubl
 Is that within melee
 Great Shell take a swipe That is a 
 So thats d right
 No she didnt Because I yep
 Great six points of damage
 No Nine points of damage
 Yeah Thats 
 Oh plus four So six so ten Ten points
of damage
 And with her bonus action she would like
to rage
 Can I use my  feet of movement to run
that direction around the far side of the ruin Yep
 Oh shit Ill just fire both streams of
Eldritch Blast from each hand
 
 Second one Thatll hit 
 Excellent Nice Thats  points of
Eldritch Blast
 Nice Great thats it
 Good rolls
 Oh the one that Ive been shooting at or
the closest
 Me too right
 
 Shell make it reckless
 Thats right Yeah Thats a 
 Shes raging so d Nice 
 Oh Get it Jamedi
 Knees weak
 Shell run up and take her two swipes
reckless
 Yes There you go
 Yeah You know it
 Thats a natural  Dope
 Thats seven 
 Shell see it sit there and shell reach
up high and shell try and cleave off the front
of the jaguars head in one downward swing
 She still has one more attack can she use
the rest of her movement to move towards the
jaguar I think she has ten feet of her movement
 Is that melee or just outside of it
 Oh great reckless as well 
 Yeah  points of damage Plus three
right Or no
 Oh thank you Lets back it down to nine
 Ill take just enough of a step back to
use Eldritch Blast again and Ill fire both of
them at it
 Eldritch Blast 
 Oh shit The first one was better  as
well on the second one
 Okay great   points
 What did you do
 Ill light it up with this crackling green
Eldritch Blast energy coming from both of my
palms causing its fur to smoke and burn off and
its snake heads to repel
 Ill look over at Nott
 All of us Six
 Are you okay
 I dont know that we did there were only
two of them and because Caleb left the bubble it
disappeared right
 We made a bit of a ruckus thats the last
thing you want to do in a jungle
 Agreed We should rally up backtoback
while Caleb casts it
 I think thats a fair assumption
 I still think one of us should stay up in
shifts inside this bubble Just in case
 What are you doing to that poor dog
 Eh whatever
 Thats a high number
 One ounce is good
 Cool
 Lets get everything together first
 Jamedi Following you
 River dancers
 Yeah

 Ooh

jungle Maybe some ticks

 Thats true
 Didnt know the Incredible Hulk was in
this motherfucker did you
 At the base of the structure its doing
that
 Okay so if Ill go over to Jamedi If
we can clear him is the path youve taken before
clear as far as you can see I dont know which
way you went
 Can anyone create a distraction that
doesnt put their own person at risk
 Its not us clearing and then the
building Theres stuff
 Although we could throw you in a net and
act like you were dinner
 Whos got a net
 How many of us can change One two

 Awesome great Two of us one each take
tie them up in rope
 Kind of
 Yeah thats less of what were looking
for
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah
 I think we should try and be as sneaky as
possible If for some reason shit hits the fan I
can make a pretty I think spectacular
distraction that doesnt put me or us at risk But
I think we should try stealth first
 Stealth distraction fuck shit up Cool
 Yeah
 What act like youre tied up
 Yeah well do it anyway
 Well tie your hands in the front
 I agree
 Thats not a bad thought
 Are there several dozen people or is
it
 Lets do that yeah

scales on the nonchangeling folks

 Directly above the fountain theres a
ceiling I take it yes
 Oh shit
 
 Directly above the fountain
 Oh yeah in a vial
 You said six inches in diameter

 Shes all fucking sick and fucked up
 On the wall where the carvings look like
theyve carved over something are there any areas
that arent done as carefully and you can see what
was there before it was carved over

Caleb I dont know if that does anything but it
was on the lady
 How long has it been for
 Oh Oh Are people listening or are we by
ourselves
 Actually that night after our convo I
had another dream
 I found myself under the ocean and then I
saw these visions of people that I knew in my
very dear to me I had to force my way through
them up this staircase and when I reached the
top Have you ever heard the word reward
 It was astounding Incredible Hard to
believe It was almost as if the oceans obeyed my
commands
 How long has it been for you
 Yeah you know beginners luck right
 Of course
 With my life
 Anybody looking at us as I turn around
  Ah ah
 Dead armpit
 Maybe shes thirsty Give her some water
from the fountain
 Coveted jerky
  Inclusion
 All evidence to the fucking contrary
 Her fucking arms in it Jester is
grabbing naked yuanti guy
 Milking its face
 He got to the top of the temple That was
it right

 Blood and viscous
 You can do better than that
 Nott want to do us a favor to make sure
our way is safe
 Oh yeah sorry
 Ahah

string at the entrance so wed know if somebody
came in

 Jamedi Captain either of you know

grows in darkness

great
 What are you holding
 Couple quick thoughts When we tried to
blow up the tree didnt work so well Two
loadbearing beams in a closed room with no
windows so its going to hurt us too
 Okay the name is great Im just thinking
maybe in practical use not the best idea here
 I am the only one doing that
 Hold for just a second Captain
 I have been an admirer of your ability to
disappear We could use that talent now if you
thought you could get up close and strike without
being detected None of us
 Do you think you have the skill to pull
off such a feat
 Is that pretty heavy duty
 Do you want to be danger close like that
 Lets do it
 Bolts are just popping off the end of it
and onto the floor just expending shells onto the floor
 What is Schmidt
 No no keg This is fantasy and magic
Fuck the blackpowder keg
 I have a strong feeling the keg of
blackpowder wont do that much damage
 Nope Dont even know if it has ears
 And kill us all
 Molly Caduceus fuck balls Im sorry

 If were keeping our distance how many
people are seriously considering fluffernutter

 Jester Caduceus Caleb are all cowering

As it rears back to strike they see the
Magicians Judge pierce through the belly of the
hydra and cleave through the middle of it
 She just goes
 No problem
 Fucking Jamedi

 Its just in your head I got stung by
some wasps out by the barn

 Ah Yall have Benadryl

 Is Jamedi up there
 Ill mirror Avantikas movement on the
other side of the room
 The eyes theyre there right Its part
of the mural theyre not missing or recessed or anything
 Onyx eyes for the first creature
 Yes its very stimulating Have you ever
seen imagery like this before
 Yeah yep the KiNau
 Nope the KiNau Theyre the followers of
Ukotoa right
 KiNau
 Fuck fuck fuck
 I can see the resemblance The question
is if thats you and thats me whos our third friend
 You said you had met only one other Chosen
before
 And what happened to them
 Indeed This person that seemed to have
shown you the light did you try to track them
down Do you know anything about them or where
they might be They would seem to be very useful
in our current situation
 Well were obviously not in a huge rush
We have not explored all of this
 Shes going to do that
 You know I do have a solution I think for
this Jamedi You worthless sack of shit you
havent done a damn thing since we got in this
temple You like to scout ahead go forward Get
your ass down that well
 What do you want a cookie Get down the
fucking well lets go

bad for her right now With her bonus action she
would like to rage She will take two attacks at
the one that shes in melee with
 Already got the reckless
 Oh balls and ass Okay

my  feet and take an attack of opportunity as I do
 So it misses
 Who has the fucking key One of us has the
key who has the key
 Who found the key
 Are we getting the impression that theyre
totally comfortable underwater
 Ooh it does
 Yasha will fucking hiho silver out that
bitch She has  feet so 
 Are Avantika and Jamedi doing anything
 Yeah the same with Jester All the way up
to the dome
 
 Shit
 Okay Looking around still having plenty
of air in my lungs I turn around and see Jester
starting to panic and I know that she has the key
so I will reach out and grab her face and bring
her into a kiss and I will blow all of my air
into her lungs
 Shape of Water
 Okay Fair enough
 Ill try and swim up towards the top
 Full movement
 Nine
 Yasha will head towards the door and wait
for it to open Shes going to use her movement to
go up
 First Poseidon movie yeah
 Oh no
 That would have been it
 Water slide
 Im unconscious I think
 Okay okay

 Lets us just get down and out of here
 Lets just get back on the ship
 
 
 Potentially if this an island
 You fools
 Right
 Natural  Yasha rolled a five
 Got to go
 Caduceus in the front everyone behind
him
 Yasha will be actually up front just in
front of you
 Nope
 Loudest thing you ever heard
 Is it going to be dexterity checks
 I was going to say Yasha can take out the
Magicians Judge and start cleaving machetestyle
through the brush making it far easier for us to
move
 Advantage or straight up
 Oh shes rageclearing
  
 Oh theres six of these I thought there
was three
 Theres two dozen of them I dont want to
get that close
  for Fjord  for Yasha
 Jamedi
 Oh shit
  Thats amazing
 I can try to assume the form of one of the
lizard people in case they make eyes on us
 I have no spell left to help
 Yes
 Oh no
  for Fjord nine for Yasha
 I remember that well
 Or you could have Yasha do it
 Athletics
 She does
 Its her biggest modifier
 Oh a natural  and a  so thats 
 On the ship On the ship
  Oh fuck
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Volley that shit
 Oh so sick
 Caleb and I are picking them off Eldritch
Blast and
 No No
 Oh my god Why did we not take a short
rest right when we started 
 I know I know
I didnt think about it damn it
 That was gnarly
 Dude youre good youre good youre
good Water is your friend youre good
 Oh fuck me
 That was a teacher
 That was a teacher
 No theres also smudge and
 fmiller yeah man
 Can we just automatically get a short
rest just because that was the most
 heinous strenuous
 No were still wearing ours Are
 It was bad luck
 Uh huh
 There are imprints being left on that
chair
 Indeed Such a mighty display on the way
back I feel like I would be left wanting if I
didnt try and pursue the same sort of glory
 Captain may I ask you knew of this
location already Do you have a lead on another
 Indeed
 We would certainly entertain that very
notion Its hard to think past any sort of a rest
 Of course
 Could we have a conversation near the bow
of the ship perhaps Away from ears Is it empty
towards the bow
 I should start by thanking all of you for
putting yourselves in harms way again I did not
expect that to go the way that it did but that
seems a repetitive notion at this point
 Yeah I knew when she showed that
exuberance at diving down that it was a matter of
urgency and I just couldnt catch her We made
our way down this well into this open spherical
room At the bottom underneath some algae there
was a recession It looked like it had space for
an orb like the eye thats in my sword In my
dullardly moment of trying to figure how the fuck
I would get it in there she reached out and she
has the same sort of thing in her hand She put it
in before I could put the sword in It ripped the
eye straight out of her hand Pulled her hand back
and blood was coming out of it I thought it had
done something to her Thats when I saw these
arcanelike symbols light up and they shoot across
the floor and straight up toward you guys right
above the water
 You saw them come out What happened
 That seems like a lot
 But no recession I cant remember when
we found the actual cats eye the sphere it
wasnt in a recession Was it just resting at the
bottom of the well
 From three different creatures
 No it was the amber one
 Yeah That big serpent with all the eyes
like in her captains
 Amber yeah
 Yeah I mean theyre yellowishamber
Yellowishorange Just depends on the way the
light hits it
 Yeah the same that she had decorated
around her office Thats Ukotoa You saw when we
were in the boat she closed her hands and you
felt that surge in the water
 Yeah I think because she got there first
and offered her orb she was rewarded with some
sort of oceanic control or power over water
 I think so
 No back when we were in the rowboats
 I think so yeah I dont know why the
water surged out of the temple like that
 You said they were protective in nature
 This is some heavy shit
 That would be a choice
 No
 Im not a crazy person all right A giant
serpent from the Calamity
 Yeah thats some medieval shit That is
bigger than anything Ive ever heard of
 I know and Caduceus I know your
experiences with water have been less than thrilling
 Im all for trying to get knowledge out of
the captain She seemed to act like she knew who
the third person was or had been
 I see that as well Thank you for the
lookout Frankly between us I actually tried to
keep her underwater after She got away real
fast
 Yeah and then I had to act like No
look at the ground It was terrible fucking failed
 I agree Id like to find out what she
knows about the third and then maybe ask for a
bit of respite before we continue I actually do
not feel very comfortable
 See I would be all for that given the
circumstances of what Beau just outlined Big
consequences looming that are ageold timeless
things But if she can control water now I would
be concerned that that effort might fall short
and then wed be super fucked I dont know what
her abilities are
 Yes I need more info Caleb I need more
data more knowledge You read books on this
stuff There has to be someone out there that
knows more about this before we just charge in
 If we have what she needs shell have to
play nice
 I think shes only interested in the one
creature so shes only interested in this type of
eye I dont even want to start to think about the
onyx eyes or the ivory eyes
 Thank you Yasha I understand your
concern Caleb I do I have a small curiosity
from the things that Ive seen I have no interest
in dealing with matters that predate time as we
know it Im pretty simple These days Ive spent
with you are the most exciting of my entire life
Im not looking to end them or the world by
frivolously giving up something that I barely
understand Id like to try to ask if we can go
separate ways and if she says no I would play
that we would join her and her voyages in the
morning and then sneak away Id like to try and
do it amicably if we can
 For sure I think either way we have to
make it to Darktow And we need a second ship
Third if she doesnt have a specific location
two ships find that thing faster than one
 What do you say Well have to play along
until we get to Darktow and it is not somewhere
that you normally want to go if youre not of the
pirate variety
 I think its a pirate island Its a
hideaway You dont go there unless youre looking
for trouble or unless you are the trouble
 Shit
 Yeah yeah yeah
 I suppose I should to keep relations up
 Yes All right Ill see you all
underneath
 In her face
 I think it just burns
 Is it magic acid
 Okay Did you make this
 Thank you
 Ooh
 Okay All right Thank you Caduceus Im
going to make you a fan of water before your life
is done I swear
 Youre going to be my strongest acolyte
Youre going to preach the words of the water
 Its really not I mean look how good
youre doing right Thriving Surviving
 Your whole life
 Yeah okay Ill get back to you on that
 Ill make my way towards the captains
quarters
 I do
 Ill try the door
 Dont rush on my account
 To your success
 One can hope Its only fair youve been
on this journey far longer than I have
 Not aerated
 I am as well Is it everything you thought
it would be
 Sword of Fathoms
 Can you tell me more about this person who
wielded it
 This Vandren you say he told you about
the Sword of Fathoms or he had a Sword of Fathoms
 The same one Was there an area a
destination a direction that you last knew that
he was going Is it in our interest to try and
find him
 How did you find if you dont mind me
asking yours
 Im sure he did
 Ill stand and just pace around the
quarters looking at the various iconography of
the serpent
 I dont We should find him
  
  This sword came to me in a very unusual
way Ive been a sailor for many years myself and
was lost at sea during a storm When I woke up I
found myself on the shore and there in the waves
next to me was this sword I dont know how I got
there but as soon as I grasped it it changed
everything The sword however did not have the
eye The eye we found later my companions and me
 Various other sailors Our captain
 Captain Twitchwood Do you know him
  A  level skill Okay
 Then Im sure you can understand the need
for secrecy for a small circle
 I do
 I remember where we found the stone
 The storm
 Yes
 I feel like you know the rest of this
story and I am at a disadvantage
 
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Now between you and I
 There was a storm do I remember
 Darktows over here right
 Were over here
 Okay okay okay Yep Fuck it 
Yes I do remember where the ship sank
 I agree I believe that will have to wait
until we find ourselves on Darktow though
  I would agree
  Yeah Im going to go for it
Im going for it I will 
Oh god okay Yep yep yep I will keep
Avantikas hand and walk around the desk and I
will try the old leanin and see what the reaction
is
 Yeah

 Up top
 Well Im sure its a ship of innocents
We dont want to stray from our path correct
 Ill use the spyglass
 
 Captain are you in a habit of
intercepting said vessels in your time at sea
 Its important that you know in my
previous life I had encounters with pirating
vessels as well and most of those experiences I
did not enjoy
 You say no need for a loss of life
 Or stubborn
 Well my fellow boatswain and navigators
to be Nope Boatswain and carpenter Yeah
 Okay carpenter and
 What are you
 Oh well I had that completely fucking
backwards
I take real good notes What
say you on such a dangerous expedition as this
 Oh yes of course
 Youre not wrong
 Jester
 Youre up for a scrap on the seas
 What would we give them
 Very well
 As long as we abstain as well as we can
from violence and as long as your men in the crew
understand my disgust at such tactics I think we
can make our way towards an intercept
 Well you said we need supplies right
 I felt like your words were different
before Listen were going to not use violence
all right Im not
 Do me a favor Spread the word amongst the
rest of us and make sure the rest of the crew
hears as well I dont want innocent blood shed if
it can be helped
 Thank you Jester
 Nope Is the big ogre
 Yes that name
 Can I find Bouldergut
 Bouldergut
 Im sure that is just for show yes
 Its important you understand I have an
agreement with the captain No unnecessary
bloodshed You will make sure that the rest of the
men know this
  I know Making sure you
know That is all
 Im running to find Nott our master
keep an eye on those guns were not looking
 Nott Nott Oh my god Look Again were not
looking to sink this ship okay Were going to
try and board get what we need and let them go I
dont want unnecessary violence
 Were doing great Beau youre going to
join me as we pull alongside the ship
 Youre part of the boarding party Go up
above
 Nott I pull Nott close and I say
 If you
fucking fire on that ship before they fire on us
you will never get into the Academy Do you
understand
 Yeah
 The letter that I have that grants me
access
 If you want that for Caleb
 So act real tough and yell real loud
Dont fire on them unless they fire on us you understand
 As long as you dont hit the ship
 Im sure youll
 Im going to leave you to it Im going
back upstairs
 At your will yeah
 The cannon goes 
 Theyre curving fast because there was a
detonation
 Well done Nott
 I look over at Caleb Caleb have you any
desire to intimidate some folks
 Beaus going with
 Yeah I dont know Thats not where Im
going Beau
 Team up with Bouldergut I want you to go
on the opposite ship and find me the captain
 Can I see how many men now that were
close how many are above deck
 Okay Sorry I didnt mean to interrupt
 Im coming with you just keep an eye out
and make sure no one is doing any shifty biz
 Not unless Rules of engagement apply Do
not fire or attack unless fired upon
 Yes
 Ill step forward and reach for gloves
that arent there and not do that My name is
Fjord Im a representative of The Squalleater
here If you will but humor us for a few moments
Im afraid were very short on supplies We need
to replenish our stores and perhaps enrich our
pockets If your men behave Im sure we will all
get out of this very little worse for wear
 Indeed Deuce food Water
 Oh indeed yes the well being of your men
obviously was something that we would easily tend to
 Now in exchange for our good will in this
interaction Im sure you wont mind if we peruse
below decks and see if there is anything of
interest
 Fantastic Bouldergut Ill call the ogre
up to just board their ship and stay on the
gangplank between ours and theirs
 Oh no Im sorry on their ship on that
side of the gangplank
 Our friend here is going to play chaperone
and ensure everyone stays nice and happy up here
Beau would you mind coming with me
 Will do Again I must emphasize no
tricky business Were in good moods It would be
smart to keep it that way
 I motion to a third so its not just Beau
and myself One of the other crew members of The
Squalleater to come with us downstairs
 Vera Ipess
 Yeah lets have Ipess come
 Yeah we go together
 Whatd you find
 Oh yes indeed it does
 Oh I believe I will
 Nice First room
 Yeah thats real good
 Well Im going to find out one way Ill
call over Bouldergut Bouldergut do me a favor
and lob this over onto the other ship would you
 I know Captain I hate to be more of an
inconvenience than this already is and I want to
get The Stormcap on its way as quickly as
possible Would you do me a favor and have all of
your men come down here and assemble at the bow of
the ship please This is getting too interesting
and I cant have you spread out all over the
place
 But of course Captain What are we
monsters
 Well make our way below deck to see what
we can see
 Ill peek my head into one of those rooms
you Get your ass up I want these crates taken
above deck and put on our ship Do it quickly do
it quietly
 Ill point out the ones with the food
some of the water and some of those frozen fruits
as well for scurvy needs
 Ill grab one of them before they I
heard that
 You know if you were on the sea long
enough you would know that Im the type that only
asks a question once Who else is down here
 
 That would be it You can go on
 Well I dont feel like we need
reinforcements for this right
 Yasha
 Yeah well make our way further into the
hold and try to find the source of the voice
 I will aid you
 I can
 Yeah can I give it a better look with my
darkvision
 Thats right Im helping her Of course
 Unmolested except for
 Ill make my way forward into the hold
even though we havent seen much
 Hits
 Hits
 Misses
 Amazing
 Yasha rolled a 
 I rolled a six
 Does he look armored
 With her bonus action she will rage and
she will make two attacks with the Magicians Judge
 Thats not good Thats an 
 And a 
 You can wifi suck HP out of somebody like
that
 Yeah
 I will stand up after having getting the
holy fucking shit knocked out of me from those
real sure this is something you want to die for I
would suggest you drop your sword Youre
outnumbered I will take a step back
 First one was a 
 Yasha will walk up and attempt to grapple
him into a bear hug
 
 Our darkleaning thing goes tick
 Friend Ow Second we saw a little
manifest that said there was some guarded parcel
down below I can only imagine that they were
talking about you Now my friend was correct She
can punch the shit out of you Also we can see
how well you want to swim Or we can just make
sure that youre on this boat healed up a little
bit and sent on your way And you can create
whatever story you want But I do need to know
what you were protecting
 Do I think hes lying
 Eight
 Nearly there
 Oh I really wish you hadnt done that I
cant guarantee her reaction to that will be a
positive one
 Yeah you are Youve done really well
 Are you being paid to protect this
 How much
 Ill give him  gold
 Ill walk up and put it in his pouch as
Yashas holding him
 Are you coming down under
 Actually while youre here
 Sorry Would you mind helping this fellow
out and giving him a little love
 Thank you He rocked me I miss raging
 While were waiting for them can I pick
up his longsword
 Can I look at it
 You dont know the half of it
 Were going to let you go now and be on
our way Im going to keep this as a memento I
would advise you to stay below If you pop up I
cant guarantee the same good will be extended
Im sure you understand
 Careful with that
 Do you want to take this on our ship and
let them be on their way
 I will take that advice and join you
 In a complete attempt to capitalize on
your disgruntled feelings would you mind telling
us who paid you to guard this or where it came
from This paintbrush
 Fair enough
 I think weve taken up enough of his time
Youve been more than flexible with our questioning
 I actually do feel that way so lets just
head up Well head up above
 I agree Do you want to make sure
everyones feeling all right before we
 Jester what are you doing
 Can I reach over and Come here I pull
his shirt aside Did you do this
 Thank you for your hospitality I am glad
that we could complete this transaction peacefully
 I wish you calm waters and safe journey
We will take it back over to The Squalleater
 What
 Not yet
 Myrtle
 Indeed there was a man in full plate
armor who got quite a few shots in
 We did yes I kept a memento I hold up
the longsword
 Thats a one
 Thats a one
 I stay up to entertain Avantika
 Bring that fucking wizard down here with
you
 I forgot to look too I did too
  

 Ooh thats a big old thing
 Trecorum Satis Dee
 Probably
  Not there

 Flying away
 Oh fuck yeah
 What do you mean
 Like the Who Framed Roger Rabbit
warehouse
 Singing sword and black hole
 What
 Dicks hanging out the walls
  I didnt think this through
  A rash of wild dicks
have appeared in Wildemount and through the
Dwendalian Empire No one can explain the huge
dongs protruding from walls sculptures and holy places
 A finite amount of ink or what
 Before port
 Before port 
 Does it say how much paint it comes with
 Wow okay
 What if you painted a pound diamond
 Okay
 Got it
 
 Well Caduceus
 My ACs 
 Why dont you protect the clerics
 Aw
   No you guys have it
 Consider it a gift after nearly dying
 In the past well now eight days
 Yeah Ill find my way back down to the
rest of them
 Whatd we get
 Shit
 Weird that they would have an armored guy
with a longsword protecting a paintbrush
that does nothing
 Im not opposed
 You didnt Frankenstein make that
triumphant bastard into life
 Its not the dick brush its the
paintbrush
 Just 
 Oh
 So we found a paintbrush that you can
paint things and they will come into being Is
that what it is
 Wow and the shield
 Can I just ask how everybody humor me
feels after today
 Yeah me neither
 Wait bucket list as in hijack a ship
before you die kind of a thing
 Nott Id ask if you have any
reservations but you seemed very enthusiastic
about todays
 Uhhuh I cant promise there will be a
lot of that but at least I know that youre DTF
cool Caleb
 Yep fire Caleb how you doing
 Yeah actually I do have some news to
share Avantika apparently has come across my old
mentor Vandren before She knew him Apparently
he carried the same sword that I have its called
the Sword of Fathoms Has a name Shes of the
opinion that he always carried on him the sword
and another one of those spheres an eye She
asked me if I knew where the ship that I was on
went down I did recall the area and she believes
that if we were to search that shipwreck we might
find this third sphere She has the ability to
mess with water now and in some of the dreams
Ive been having I believe theres quite a bit
more where that has come from
 Not all the time I admit Ive been very
excited about all of this but the things I see
are world changing Scary
 I dont know
 I dont know that either
 Well when you say it like that I dont
know I meant only the power that might come
before that happens
 I
 I actually dont know Im just assuming
that because she placed her sphere at the bottom
of that well in that temple there are two other
temples which we have to do the same thing and
that might lead to the release of that serpent
 Right the third sphere and I have the
second
 It would be a lot for one person
 Correct Can I just take a second and ask
Caduceus to check the door
 Without saying too much more I think its
best that we all listen to Calebs words and play along
 Well be making our way to Darktow
 And then we will reevaluate
 Just feel like and Ill try and be
subtle as possible that only the people in the
room would hear  There are people
that we cant see I just dont feel like this is
the best place to converse
 Its not our ship
 I think I would know the location based
off the trade route
 At the bottom of the fucking ocean
 Mmhmm
 All good ideas
 Trying to use that to our advantage
 Thanks I appreciate it Im trying to
keep her close If she starts to suspect us well
be in trouble If anyone feels uncomfortable with
how things are going please let me know My
curiosity is not worth dying for or doing
something you feel like youd regret I value what
everyone thinks here
 Well thats just fucking dark
 Now Jester where would you learn a
phrase like that
 Cool yeah Caleb said something similar
last night or a couple days ago All right
well enjoy the paintbrush
 I mean were going to find our way to
Darktow
 With the seducing
 I mean Caduceus if you want to teach me
a thing a two about wooing a woman
 Yes to what you said and yes to what you
said
 You just do you girl
 Yeah I think that will be very valuable
when the time comes
 About what time of the day is it
 Time to break out the banana margaritas
Its only afternoon
 Sounds good
 Caleb can I speak to you for a moment
Above deck
 Ill go up
 How far away are you
 

 Seeing where Jester is Ill pull Caleb
aside May I ask you a frank question
 I had to admit I found myself a bit
surprised My initial impression of you was
someone a bit timid and maybe reserved meek even
Your tone your opinion of what to do with
Avantika in order to make sure that were okay it
seemed very calculated Very risky Do you
mind me asking if youve Have you ever
sacrificed anything in order to achieve a greater
goal Because I feel like I am swimming in the
deep end and I dont quite know what Im doing
 Likewise You dont miss much do you
 You have a very shrewd sensibility as
well You seem to be able to weigh pros and cons
in an equation a scenario
 I do I dont mean any of it as a
critique but more as a compliment and Ill add
with it a request Keep that eye of yours on
Avantika for me I dont entirely know what her
intentions are but I feel like there are only a
few that I could ask to exercise quick judgment in
a moment of need
 I think you know what I mean but in case
this thing gets out of hand can I count on you to
right the ship if need be
 Of course
 Thank you and thank you for talking with
me
 Yeah Just so Ill turn and walk off
 Wait you can do that
 What do you mean
 What
 Thats the first we heard that right
 We heard that before right
 Yeah
  Oh shit

 Fuck I wake up and immediately grab the
map
 Yeah
 Okay
 Well Urukayxl and weve been heading
towards Darktow so weve been coming across did
we pass the wall Coming in this direction did we
pass
 Okay
 Thats where we were
 There is
 There is and then dead center is a lot of
space You could say that this is the center
but okay
 Well the shipwreck is here
 Well in the vision the three land masses
are in a triangle
 At the time
 Yeah so itd be heading west
 Mmhmm
 Yeah Ill be doing that later
 You did have days
 Shawshank style
 Is the flag just solid purple
 Ten for Fjord and  for Yasha
 The Revelry
 
 Guess were part of the island now
 They didnt sign up for that shit
 A monthlong journey
 Kill those guys
 I thought for sure Caduceus was going to
give Jamedi a little
 Oh god
 Were at the end of the world my friend
 Its going to be time for you to toughen
up a bit Do you have a pirate face
 Is that a pooping face or
 Okay well until you find a better one
thatll do Whats your pirate name
 Yeah
 Did we say there was a plan
 Im not sure Did we have a plan
 I dont even really remember who they
are
 No I think weve brought them to a port
of great business If they choose to stay here
they certainly can Otherwise theyll have to
wait until were leaving again
 Im just scared
 How guarded or patrolled or monitored are
the docks
 In this area are there uniformed patrols
or do you just see well armed
 Is packing
 Were going to follow
 Something they would wear that would
identify
 Theyre not wearing a hat or a sash
 Oh lord We all going to die Well tell
the crew they can have the evening They can have
the evening weve just been at sea this whole
time but in the morning we expect work to
continue on The Mistake
 We never divvied up that box
 Yeah it was intentional guys Were
fine
 You feeling at home there Deucy
 The guy that pushes past whats he look
like Whats he wearing
 You cant just let these guys go by

room outside from Avantika

down right in front of her and Ill take a knee on
the floor so Im kneeling next to her on the
hard feelings right
 Right whatevers best for the ship
 Well I feel the presence of Ukotoa

partnership here will be a beneficial one
 Well this has been fun If you need
anything as your quartermaster you just let me know

 Hourly flareup
 Wow where the fuck did you guys just go
I hope were going there after this show

get too lost in it
 I was wondering how empty that cup is
 I was going to ask
 You had an ale or whatever everybody else
is drinking
 Caduceus Wayne
 Gunner master Nott gunner master
 Was she directing that towards Avantika
 You mean a competitor in terms of sea
space or in terms of your faith
 Divers Grave
 It would appear so yeah
 
 Yeah Thats fortuitous
 Her claws
 Single eye huh
 Anyone else getting a bad feeling about
that
  Break it break it break it
down
 Sorris is that somewhere youve been to
You seem like a very fortuneseeking type
 You dont stop either
 You know most myths are based off of some
sort of fact We dont happen to know what the
song thinks this dreadful creature is do we
 Is that a thing
 You cant really sing underwater so hows
that work
 I love that everyone did that at the same
time Thats all I needed Well great Well find
this solution to the diving in the morning and

solution
 Well being that youll be out anything
you need done for the ship or the crew while
youre away as your quartermaster
 Wonderful All right And your crew Do I
need to keep an eye on anyone
 Wonderful
 Being that this is our first time in
Darktow I would like to see the rest of the area
Would anyone care to join me for a stroll
 Back corners alleys
 No
 Who would be so foolish Little would they
know theyd be tangling with Avantikas crew and
thats something they dont want to mess with
right
 You see everything why are you even
rolling
 Youve got fucking MadEye Moodys eye

 You seemed a little more at ease Ill
lean in a little bit
 You do much drinking in there Im not
really getting the fumes on your breath
 Really

 What happens when you drink
 Did you have stuff in your cup right You
dont have to fake it You can just
 Right
 Anything popping up on that special radar
of yours
 Yeah That she is Should we grab the
others and go explore for a bit
 Yep I mean I think

wanted to talk to you about Youre real good at
picking up on little things yeah
 Heh no I think thats pretty clear
 Im just letting you know Im trying to
keep her close I feel like this whole things
getting a little out of sorts and the best way to
keep a small finger on the pulse of things is to
 Yeah Havent been very good at it so
far
 Thank you
 Yeah more of that to come Wheres the
rest of these chucklefucks
 Head down huh Contemplation
  I want to take a night walk
thats not a song
 Well poke our heads back in and go
Well wave them out
  Ask him about the Divers
Grave
 Ill get the other 
 If I may Orly you seem to be very
familiar with the Divers Grave and the song Do
you know anything more specific of it and
creatures that might be in that area Things to
look out for
 Deepocean folk
 Any good things about the area that you
care to share
 Right
 All right who are we missing
 Why are you guys wiping your hands on your
pants
 Okay Who wants to go explore
 Yeah I figured well use the night air to
our advantage acclimate a little bit
 Oh if there is trouble lets try and
resolve it well
 Yeah
 The Judge Will do Its so intimidating
when she says it like that
 For the sword
 Up away from the docks
 Checking the bottom of my shoes like

What did we step in Why is it
 Outhouse campaign two Here we go
 Like
 Okay Tiffany And
 Which ship
 How will they crack this if they hear us
 How do we reference the
 The Apricot
 Nope its this
 Say that again
 Lets walkandtalk about Tiffany
 Tiffany doesnt know that were talking
about her
 Come on
 A lot of store fronts and things that are
closed up for the night
 No Maybe they were looking for a new
environment and they found exactly what they were
looking for
 Ooh natural  for 
 There was a lot of assimilation here
 Here it is
 How drunk are you
 I think thats the highest priority The
only thing that we havent discerned from Tiffany
is if she knows where the next
 No we know where the apricot might be
where the next apricot tree might be
 Or fruit stand I like it
 Well if you used her right name
 Yeah wow
 Well I can tell you that her quarters
have a balcony
 Yeah because if we are planning to leave
without her that means shell give chase I
mean I hate to even suggest it but Id rather
not have someone hot on our tail
 Well as Honda I would race to the
apricot and seize it so that she cant pick that
fruit Keep it for ourselves in our fruit basket
and make off and decide if were going to make
marmalade later or not
 We actually dont know where the other
tree is yet thats the thing We just know where
the fruit is
 Theyre in season right now
 If we do that we might need to ask
Tiffany if she knows the location of the tree
because it hasnt been brought up as of yet
 It was a long walk but were all on the
same page Okay are we up for a little BE
 In real life or the game
 Yeah absolutely Dont you have another
way to make a door
 Yeah
 I mean there was a door was it solid
wood or did it have glass
 Sure
 Maybe with a short rest Maybe
 Whos the queen in this scenario
 The two clerics are not going on the
mission together
 Doesnt Ipsis small like
 Thats a natural one this is going to
fucking suck

 All right Okay
 No
 Also where are we staying tonight Are we
staying at The Bloated Cup or we finding
 On Tiffanys ship
 It might not be a bad idea to find a room
thats not at the Bloated Cup and not on the ship
Just so were not suspicious
 How do you feel about rooms at the
Bloated Cad
 Three rooms
 Hopefully some with windows
 Smells like shit in there
 Famous last words
 Look Ill be fine Ill make sure shes
occupied
 Now what do you mean in the room
 What form is Frumpkin an octopus
 Is he there
 Am I carrying him in like its no big
 Yeah I dont think so Listen lets just
kick this thing off Ill toss Frumpkin back to
Caleb Look I leave this in your capable hands
 If for some reason Tiffanys on the move
or if something seems up listen for thunder How
about that
 Nothing I could say would beat that So
 Sure whatever you feel is best
 All right here we go I head off towards
The Bloated Cup
 Real confident real strong
 If Bouldergut is in the Bloated Cup
thats where Yasha is
 Is somebody aiding you in that No
 Its real sotto so we dont have to use
code words anymore
 Hes our type man he thinks sleeves are
bullshit too
 No Im not
 False backs to safes
 Ill head up the stairs to the second room
on the right was it
 Anyone in the hallways
 No sign of Bouldergut
 
 Shes an ogre
 Okay Yeah second door on the right and
Ill put my ear against the door
 Shit balls ass Oh three
 
 

 Oh sorry Is  is the
captain in
 Fjord Whos this
 Second door on the Is there a door
across the hall
 Ill put my ear on that one
 Three
 Does it look like theres any light on
under the door
 Bouldergut
 Captain
 Shes very loyal
 How long has Bouldergut been with you in
your service
 Quite some time How have your evenings
been
 Any more dreams
 Tell me
 Yes Id like that
 Yes thats more correct yeah
 Can you give yourself advantage
 I dont need this in my life
 Jewelry boxes
 Confused is complicated
 Hes going to tell you youve got to roll
to see what happens
 Yeah she could be straight up like
Nope
 Ill open the door Is there any ice No
Okay
 Yeah
 Its even harder to spot them now
 The most inconspicuous person
 Oh my god
 Perception
 What does that do
 Or running
 Im in a great deal of pain
 
 Bloated Cup
 No smoke coming out of the cigarette
   I look
down the stairs Can I see Caduceus down there
 Yeah Ill come down and A drink
 Hey Deucey How we doing
 Oh good report
 Yeah Ill just hold my cup and wait for
something to happen
 Oh compound
 Well shall we you know turn in for the
night Seems like its been a crazy one
 Well all pile into one room before we
separate for the night
 Or how about
 Whatd you find
 Oh Okay
 Well first
 Was it hidden where you found it Should
we detect to see if it has magic anyway like a
trace on it
 Yeah just empty your pockets Lets just
make sure nobodys following this stuff
 Thats not as lofi as we were
discussing
 We saw them
 Yeah well isnt Allison not cool with
Avantika and the enemy of my enemy is my friend
right So why would we want to get Allison in
trouble
 Yeah
 Sure Yeah
 Maybe we just hold onto them for now They
came in containers right
 Are they just gems or are they specific
pieces of jewelry
 If youre going to plant them on anybody
Vera would be a good candidate
 Well because shes a bitch We got to get
her out of here Shes you know wants my job
 Yeah were definitely going to plant it
on her Cause some commotion at the top Caleb
what do you got
 Oh it hasnt been time
 Ooh
 Please be an almanac Sorry
 What language was that in
 Oh
 Thats not great for us
 Youre due one
 Rise baby rise
 What if the necklace as a trace on it
 O for six in the series and you crank one
at the bottom of the ninth
 Oh wow
 Were not keeping anything on our persons
We need to hide it bury it
 Uhhuh You dump that bag out or just go
searching for a necklace stick your hand it it
comes right out
 Or we could oldschool bury it under a
tree right Mark it Same diff
 Frame somebody
 Well listen I am all for putting Vera in
a bad light right Avantika is going to want to
know who did this Yeah Tiff Old Tiff Fanny
Might as well put it on her right
 No
 No but maybe were thinking too
smallball If you can actually make a translation
of that thing thats the frame weve been looking
for We take that to the Plank King were going
to get all the head start we can get We know
where the other peach tree is now so
 Its apples and peaches so you know
 Yeah
 Yeah I think its too dangerous to try
and plant it on her Its adding one step that we
dont need
 I think we take it once youre
finished
 Yeah I agree
 I dont think it does right As Beau has
appropriately stated many times snitches get
stitches If we walk that in there the Plank King
might just be looking for disloyal motherfuckers
to hang up by their toes We need to find a way to
either message that to send via messenger with
the book and a codex that youve created and let
him be able to see the evidence for himself
 Were assuming that she wants to destroy
her
 Yeah maybe they need to  get it on
you know
 A physical copy or up in the dome
 True
 What
 To go with the package
 Yeah that swings back to us a little
bit
 Yes Yeah I dont know how we get out of
here but were going to try
 Well we need to wait until they apprehend
her
 We do something
 Oh boy You know Okay Just throwing it
out there big picture okay because there are
two goals on that map One is the peach the other
is the peach tree If we go to one and she goes to
the other and lets say she gets deferred
adjudication and gets out just a little bit after
us she might be waiting for us at one or the
other Im just saying
 Lets just do that Lets let Caleb do his
thing and well see what the morning does Where
are we keeping the gems and everything else in the
meantime
 The lead safe Do we still have that In
the bag

 We do have the lead safe The
Dodecahedrons in it
 Yeah Make it so
 Well once shes apprehended
 Yeah okay Well send some food and water
up your way

lead safe

 No
 Let me see Yeah
 Ive got crazy spells after the next short

 I think Avantika thinks that Bouldergut
had the book Would the book have taken the
Fireball damage
 Cool
 Those sweet allwhite New Balance
 She does

 Are you resisting
 Im never going back
 They played sports when they were younger
Theyre really dextrous
 Did we turn it on its head for you
 Oh my god

  Whitestone saw the fire
 I wonder why
 Come on
 Oh right
 Jamedi does not like her
 Oh god 
 You think
 Hes the fighter
 I know I was going to say the same
thing
 Bless you Mercer
 We understand your distrust We are new
here and we only beg your patience as we prove
ourselves before you Avantika and her crew were
up to foul deeds Our friend Beau here I trust
has shown you her journal
 Great king if we may time we have
 Its at your whim that we serve I think
it would be only fair to ask that we remain under
guard while your compatriot here translates that
text
 Fair enough
  Is she talking to me
 Plank King if I may My ears though
pointy can only stand a certain amount of
dishonesty I would prefer to cut through the
bull There are those of us among us who can make
sure that the truth is spoken here I would beg of
you to allow that to happen now
 Natural 

  Who has that shit
 You do
 Honorable Plank King the means justify
the ends My compatriot here will place her Cobalt
knuckles upon the chin of Avantika and you will
hear the truth You need but only ask your
questions again
 Make sure you tell the Plank King its a
limited time engagement
  Those poor fuckers
 Stonecold killer
 That is beyond a generous sentence
 Well make do We will leave with great
haste
 Sin eater
 Youre a prospector
 Avantikas crew are still manacled up
 No Maybe one or two of them Ipess
 What Weve got to have somebody to kill
while were at sea
 Better Yeah and they do
 If I may who is really good at finding
shit You two and anyone
 Yeah How about you three into Avantikas
quarters and turn it upside down
 Not my intention but go ahead
 Okay
 Just in case she booby trapped this ship
search the hull search her quarters search everything
 Is Jester able to mend some of those
damaged
 Is that a good thing
 Its a good thing
 Can I find Orly
 Ill bring out the map
 I dont have it near me
 Do we know where the map is please
 Damn it Bobby
 Do we know if we are making our way
 Ill tell Orly
 Orly if you could help us
plot a course as damaged as we are heading north
to this point
 Wow
 Wait who played him
 Because this is on a trade run and this
whole isle is part of that could we make port for
more extensive repairs there
 Resupply
 Thats the closest thing
 Divination What do you mean
 I would love to have you do that
 It is but we dont have any other
 Thank you for the Shawshank obtuse
reference
 You look rejuvenated Did you say Bisaft
 Youre sure
 All right then You can let Orly know
 Will we pass over that area as were
heading towards Bisaft
 No Im just asking
 Yeah
 Relieved
 Yeah I was worried for a moment there I
knew it was going to come to something like that
but Caleb pulling the trigger the way he did
was
 Yeah
 Right
 He did Hes very strong
 I think so yeah
 No I didnt It hurts to see so many
react to a name that only meant so much to me
but I dont even know if hes alive We might
find him down there
 Well see
 What do you mean
 You send messages to Kiri
 What do you say
 Can she respond to these messages
  Go fuck yourself
 Right I suppose what would you put in
the letter to the Plank King
 I mean I dont know if its necessary I
cant think of anything as of yet I dont know
maybe Ill just let you know Thank you for
offering though
 Yeah
 Okay all right Yeah Thank you for not
telling the others
 Ive got to go check on Orly make sure
were going the right way
 The island
 Fucking secrets
 I appreciate that Orly Hey Caduceus do
you have any way of I dont know youve got
those vibes right feeling down and I dont
know doing a little ping on the bottom
 I dont know I dont want to put you in a
box or anything but you seem to pick up the most
 Ill summon the falchion and Ill say

Maybe try to locate this and Ill point towards
the eye Not this eye but a similar eye
 Nope
 How long do we have
 Yeah What like two days and then go fix
the boat proper and come back if we have to
 How about we spend two to three days and
if we dont find it we can go and repair the boat
proper or at least get the materials to do that
 Sure we can
 Nott I would leave it at your discretion
We all have the ability to travel under the waves
with great ease
 I have a way of making it so that water
becomes like air for you down there
 It feels a little thicker like if you
were in a really dense fog maybe
 It is
 Or you could stay above if you wanted to
send a Message if some trouble appears on the
horizon Id just hate to leave you behind on such
a great adventure There could be buttons there
could be little jewels ingots
 What are you talking about Iits the
bottom of the ocean Ships throw people all the time
 I heard tell there was a button ship that
crashed right along the water
 Yep
 There might be bronzed shoes maybe little
silver cups Decoder rings
 Were coming upon the area right
 Yeah I think so
 
 
 You did
 Come on you got it
 
 I think that means its probably not down
there but Id still like to take a look
 I think so Were starting to round an
area that I think we could probably fan out and
explore amongst the seven of us
 That is actually If it wouldnt be too
much trouble Caleb that would be
 Yeah Id be okay with it
 His ears are just dripping saliva
 That is great news Does anybody not
want to join Really You want to stay up here
 Ill cast a little on you and for 
hours you can breathe underwater freely
 Yeah You could hold onto my shoulders if
you wanted to
 Actually we could take a few of the
cannonballs to just
 Thats because of the air Youre going to
have to equalize
 But if youre breathing water theres no
air to expand or contract
 After a certain depth Theres only one
way to find out
 I know I do too Those that want to
join join me at the rail Ill jump on and sit on the rail
 Were not on the boat were in sand
 Ill leave Orly in command while we head
under To complete this spell Im going to need
everyone to hold hands in a circle
 Do we need to have the rights to that
song
 Uhhuh Cool
 Well while its happening because it was
such a good song I will cast Underwater Breathing
on all seven of us
 Cannonballs
 Well we could just use four and have two
people hold on to the same cannonball
 I dont suppose we have  feet of rope
on this ship do we
 If youre ready take a seat on the rail
and Ill hop up and put my butt out towards the sea
 Yasha does
 You need a minute
 Ah smart
 Hes just fucked
 But hes got a good tan now and some
scars his clothes are kind of fucked up
 On the count of three when youre ready
youll lean backwards off the rail and fall into
the water
 Ooh make a little handle
 You want to share a cannonball Jester
 Okay
 She gets her own cannonball because
shes
 Yeah shes just like that Just holding
it like a beast
 Ready One two three
 I try to catch Nott How is she doing
 Are you breathing well I give her a
 International sign for breathe
 Actually that means go down
  Well listen Nott as long as
were down here
 Aww baby calves
 
 Five for her
 I push forward towards it Point and start
to swim
 There was a number of scenarios that
didnt happen
 Well said
 I think all anyone asked is for some
slight improvements in our planning over the
years Slight improvements
 I saw it Thats all I needed We can head
back up now
 No Were doing this thing Nott Were
pushing through
 Yeah
 Well I mean thatd be great if we could
find that
 No
 No
 Lets see whats down there in general
Hope it goes without saying if you find any
remains lets be respectful
 No
 Do we see any other sea life
 Thank god its not Heres an Astral
Dreadnought
 Oh thats right
 Oh right
 Thats a natural one
 I have darkvision
 The first one was a five so six
 
 The Tides Breadth

 I dont think I named it in my backstory
The Tides Breadth yes
 Lets go for it
 Like a seal
 Per the song I mean
 I mean what are the chances The oceans
huge
 Glass half empty I get it Its all
right
 Got eyes right now All right well push
forward
 Should we stick together or do we want to
fan out and go around
 Sure yeah thatd be fine
 As we get closer can we see from outside
the ship the extent of the damage from the initial explosion
 Yeah no I chased Sabian down into the
hold of the ship and he was messing with a
package I saw a fuse burning As I chased him
back up above deck there was an explosion and it
threw me from the ship Its nice to know that it
wasnt a small explosion A real motherfucker of a
thing apparently
 No we were in a storm He wasnt supposed
to go below decks either that wasnt normally
his thing so it was strange When he went down
there I saw him When I confronted him he threw
a dagger into my chest
 Yeah well he turned on me real fast He
seemed to know that what he was doing wasnt up to
snuff When I chased him above he was at the bow
of the ship getting ready to exit or jump off
Obviously he knew what was coming next Then the
explosion went and the last thing I saw was the
ship as I was being thrown off
 Yeah I dont know why though I didnt
see anybody
 I dont know I assume
 No Sabian was someone I grew up with who
was also brought by Vandren to work on the ship
Yeah Ive known him for many many years and
hes always been a piece of shit of one variety or
another Only in the most recent years did I think
that maybe that stuff had faded between us and
wed found a way to work together But apparently
not
 Ooh As an idea sword in my hand as we
start to push in through that hole of the
explosion or peer in can I lead with the sword
and see if the light andor eye is reacting in any
sort of way Or is it just static
 Not my best Nine
 In the sea certain creatures like to make
homes of vessels You want to send in your
 Yeah
 Oh
 Why dont you node
 And drift
 If you dont mind I know this ship better
than anybody Jester would you come up with me
and we can explore the captains quarters Might
be a good place to start
 No Im okay
 Ill drop the cannonball and I will push
up off the ground Supermanstyle in the water
and swim up above the deck
 His quarters are that way We should push
forward
 Swim over
 I imagine so Could be still
 I would say no but there seem to be more
than a few things that I didnt know about him
 Youre so strong might want to give it
a
 Really
 Its all missing Is there anything that
I
 Is there anything that I see that is
definitely out of place or changed that I remember
 Third one of the day Lets go with this
dice Natural one
 Apparently You can pee down here and
nobodyd notice
 Maybe we should get the others and what
fucking Extra
 Im always eating stuff Maybe we should
get some of the others to come in and do a more
 Yeah
 Unless you want to give it a look
 Yeah He was a tidy man he certainly
wouldnt have left things like this It looks
like either before or after it went down
somebody was definitely fucking looking for something
 Do I I dont think I do
 Could be Yeah Ill go get Caduceus and
Caleb
 Ill go get everybody
 What
 No
 What do you mean
 Thats amazing Lead the way
 No lets go now
 Do you know how far away it was
 All right Yes Fine Take five minutes
six minutes and
 Is it dented at all or just scratched
 Yeah like an inch between the claw marks
or a couple inches
 While theyre doing this you can tell if
it moves right
 Okay
 Glad you remembered that Im kind of
forgetful
 Here underwater Yeah
 Might be Did you find anything
underneath Any remnants of that explosion
package shrapnel anything like that
 I think its safe to assume that that was
done after the ship sunk A hole this size
wouldnt keep a vessel in the water very long
 Glowing eyes
 Pretties
 Locate Ariel
 True Very true
 Im sorry I cant wait any longer Do you
mind if we go This is all too strange
 Fuck it well go back up above deck and
well jump off the stern in the direction that Jester

 Wanting to be drunk but not really
 Oh shit
 Yasha got a

swings wildly
 Yeah she is Right yeah and she is back
there Oh and there they are Okay lovely
Underwater is her speed halved
 Except mine
 My armor Wow good fucking deal Okay
 How far in this diagonal movement would 
feet get Yasha towards the nearest enemy
 Yeah
 Almost
 Okay she will swim towards that merrow
and with her bonus action she would like to rage
 Oh yes then lets do that and get within
melee
 As a point of order can she also yell
Dont let them leave
 That was more Caleb than Yasha but
 Thats it
 Fuck a duck Yeah okay that changes
shit Thats got to go Oh boy Oh yeah
 I will with my bonus action cast
Hexblades Curse on this merrow the one thats in
the middle and I will fire two Eldritch Blasts at

 Four so thats  points of damage The
second one is nine points of damage so 
 Actually you gain plus three to damage
rolls on Hexblades Curse so instead of

movement I will move back under the deck where
Caduceus and Caleb and Jester are
 One step in

 If they both have sentinel
 Ill make it reckless

 The last syllable delivered that one
 Half their speed and

 Shes going to take two reckless attacks
at this one that is near her for just a straight roll
 So  on the first one
 The second is a 
 The first one  Damn it Seven
plus three is ten And the second one
 Great Shit So if I didnt need that
second attack did I waste it on the one that was there
 I made it reckless so it was just a
straight roll Ill use the  feet to head down
towards the one that Caduceus is right in front
of
 Is that melee
 Okay yeah
 I should have to roll yeah
 
 Okay great This does not have the extra
d so thats three plus six is nine  points of
slashing damage
 Im sorry Matt Will you add two points
of damage the last one that I just hit

for rage damage because I didnt add that
 Yes I will come out of the quarters to
move within melee of the one that everybodys

 Oh you got him
 Check their corpses See if they have
anything on them that can tell where they came from
 Nott really weve got to get over this
fear man We got a job to do
 But where in the ocean where
 No
 Dont do it like that You know that
shits important
 If only we could close the barrier to
the
 Wait Nott Were about to cross the area
of the button graveyard that lies beneath the waves
 Im just looking out for you Nott I
dont want you to
 Jester Im sure all that action probably
messed up your Locate Or is it still up somehow
 Would you lead the way
 Yeah
 Under the water or on the surface
 Were definitely in that shit now The
song Yall remember the song
  Six
 I mean its always rough waters and the
storms are frequent You normally make it through
with good prep but I didnt know it was like
this
 Her
 Its all sterile its fine
 We need to take a short rest
 We keep going but I think we remember
from the song that that could be the lantern
light right
 Maybe we should fan out a bit
 Yeah like a firing line
 No Nott I need you here Maybe give
ourselves ten feet of distance between each other
and fan out
 No the clerics are not sticking
together
 The clerics do not stay together anymore
 Well fan out in a wide line as we
approach instead of as a group
 Am I with you Jester
 If shes a bigass anglerfish Im going to
be so pissed
 Hey One of us has a familiar that can
look for us right
 Fucking awesome
 Were  feet away right
 Can we get within  feet
 Yeah
 Cautiously
 Oh fuck
 Mmhmm
 Who wants to take a look
 Lets keep moving in yes Theres nothing
gained by staying up here
 As we approach this area that hes
described to us this white coral you said it was
in a valley like a dip
 At the top of where the valley is is
there any cover that we might be able to get up
behind and then peek down into said valley like
boulders
 I will be
 Oh yeah he doesnt have darkvision
 Oh theres an entrance to the tunnel
okay
 Nott did you think I was lying
 Im hurt Our friendship has taken damage
from this exchange
 Like Santa Claus you might have to go up
and check for yourself Tug on the beard see if
 But do it by yourself
 How much do you love buttons
 Yeah no I do Yeah All right Fine We
do it together
 Im open to suggestions
 Dont one of yall have a copy of
yourselves that you could send in a certain distance
 I mean if its a trap that can be sprung
by something going in maybe fish or maybe a
humanoid that would probably be good
 Well theyre going to know really quick
right Were not going to make it in silently
right I mean this is clearly a honeypot its a
trap Might as well spring the trap
 I agree Lets do that
 Mmhmm lets do it
 Make it so
 Around the sides of the map instead of
just across
 Conserve the reef you guys be responsible
divers
 Oh come on
 Can it please be the infomercials where
she has trouble collecting the coins
 I cant hold shit
 No theres nothing down there Ill jump
down there and join Jester
 Mmhmm
 Really good on these today Three
 Looks fine
 Ill look up where everybody is and Im
like
 Im already down here so Ill summon the
falchion
 Ill hold it up Is the eye doing anything
other than casting that glowing light
 Yall do something before I get reckless
 I knew it was coming it just
 My backs sweating
 The light stopped doing this across the
gold right
 Okay
 The one that you wore Matt
 Its just a cave you guys
 Oh fucking Jesus our stealth is going to
be balls here What does the floor look like
Sand silt coins
 Cant you just tell me
 Yeah nine
 I used it up last week
 Thats true
 Do you want to keep your duplicate in
front of us or is it gone
 Towards the top
 Just hold on octopushead
 Were going to the right
 Did you hear anything from your talk
 Can we move towards the fork
 This seaweed in the middle of the chamber
have we seen anything like this before
 What was the color of the fruit in the
fucking temple Werent they like
 But the inside was purplish and red
right Well because it was obviously being fed blood
 Sorry trying to make a connection where
there might not be one
 Yeah no deal okay
 Did we want to separate and go around and
meet on the other side
 Anybody have any objections to going to
the right
 Lets do it
 There might be but well keep an eye on
it as we move around to the right I just have a
very strong feeling about going to the right Its
based off of really gut Im right handed so
were going to go to the right
 Can we see a top to this chamber
 Okay can we start moving to the right
Will we be able to see a clear divide between the
two left and right passages
 Its a divide that goes from ceiling to
floor right Its not some fucking uvula thats
hanging right there waiting to dangle
 Okay You know what Im saying
 Hey Nott stab the floor really fast
 Stab the floor with your dagger
 Thank you Well continue to the right
  I dont like it
 Its in my head
 No
 I dont know
 Now were in the mouth of a beast Ducey
whats going on brother
 Id say burn it down but you know
 under the sea
 You know what who really needs the
sphere Should we just go back to the boat No I
didnt mean it either All right we move
forward
 That shits going to reach out I dont
know how to stop it
 Dont do this to me Everyone else at this
table is less susceptible to shit like that Dont

thats around Are there also strips of cloth and
bone and body
 As shes resting on her back foot her
eyes are open

invade our bodies theyre going to walk us into
the walls We should huddle together and keep a
hand on each other If one of us stops moving
stop that person Okay We need to move forward
quickly
 Yeah if its closed our way forward yes
Otherwise we should move quickly
 With the hustle I mean on the hustle On
the quick march

be any closer to Dashilla
 Sure Platform sounds good And she will
use her handy heal thing to pump seven points of
healing into Caleb

 So Caleb gets six hit points as an action

 Does that bring him back to
consciousness
 Okay Just making sure

 Can I try and hold the sphere to my
chest
 Ooh hotness Mmm Lets kill this bitch
and get the fuck out of here
 Sure we can let her go
 This pedestal are we going to just leave
it
 I was only curious about the orb but it
just seems so
 The temple I was in before had a recessed
spot for the sphere That just seems like a rune
right like a symbol
 No
 I do not Yeah we can get out of here
Just on our guard as we go
 Yeah no youre right you havent
 Who runs in a haunted house now Thats
fucking amazing
 What the fuck All three ones on her ds
 Ill turn to Caleb and say
 Listen this
is more your thing than mine but arent you at
least curious about what this pedestal does
 Yeah I dont think it has anything to do
with the sphere its not like the lock or the
temple that I saw before The top of this pedestal
is covered in rust
 Blood
 Arent you the least bit curious what a
little drippydrip might do

 Always
 Mmhmm
 I put my
 Ill take 
 Just trying to provoke some chance here
 Okay Is there a chance that were giving
this to her
 I understand I think were good We can
go
 We understand each other Cut palm to cut
palm
 Ill start to head out of the chamber
  Yasha rolled a seven
 Plus theres water
 Its not air Its water
 
 We were hundreds of feet under water
 Outstanding
 Make for the Gravid Archipelago
 Sure it is
 Oh shit We could have sunk our ship
 We would have been walking for a long
time
 As a point of order you were right we
were supposed to head here to fix the ship first
I want to do that because weve got a fucked up
ship
 Ill say well go to the Bisaft Isle
 No I want to repair the ship
 Yeah
 That would have been a thing if we had
gotten up and it was like all stormy and we were
like  Wheres the boat
 Hey man I have been ordered to provoke
every once in a while
 Should we go back down and just push the
button just make sure that were wiped out once
and for all Im kidding We should make our way
over to the Bisaft Isle right Need repairs
 That would be the thing to do
 Yeah hows everybody feeling by the
way Are we damaged beat up We all right
 Id estimate probably three or four
 Believe You hear that Holy shit I got
it right As I was saying Orly if you would
please plot us a course to the Bisaft Isle
 Bisaft
 No H its Bisaft
 Can you do that up in the crows nest
please
 Yeah which on DD Beyond
 Why would you be anywhere else
 Can you uncanny dodge a shitty dex roll
 We have a fucking stowaway
 Caleb Jester Beau Everybody below

 That you Nott
 What did you do
 Im glad you survived Theres a lot of
gunpowder down there
 Nott What is coming out of your mouth
right now
 Yall have daily prayers
 Thats a lot of heat
 Yeah right You heard that it was like

 Fjord 
 Are you sure there are no more booby traps
below
 Can you go back down there Take Beau
Jester with you and we will stay up here to make
sure they dont get by you on the way out but you
need to find whomever or whatever that was and

 But Isolate and contain go now
 Apologies

for the last week It is filled with apple cores
and chocolate wrappers and stuff
 Real perceptive rogue
 What is that
 Is that mud on her face
 Chocolate
 Twiggy
 You can call me Fjord Thats not
necessary
 Sure Captain Fjord works
 This is Caleb
 Yasha walks over and bends over at the
hips and puts her eyes right in front of Twiggy
I like her She walks away
 Sure
 Yeah I can tell
 Thats my emotion
 Fair enough How old is she
in the background
 Arent you worried that her parents are
wondering where she is or her family
 Were in the middle of the ocean Jester
 Im actually from Port Damali
 Well howdy there What a coincidence
This is so crazy Are you trying to get anywhere
in particular
Port Damali
 I understand that
 Wow okay
 Wow
 Were you by yourself Twiggy Theres no
one else we have to worry about pissing in the
corner of the boat do we
 Whos Trixie
They like me
 Who are you talking to
 A rodent
 What the fuck is that Goddamn chinchilla
What is it
 I dont trust squirrels theyre tree
rats
 You just keep it to yourself
pocket
 Jester can I put you in charge of keeping
an eye on Twiggy Twiggy were going to the
Bisaft what is it
 Bisaft Isle I dont know if youre
familiar with that area We need some repairs and
then hopefully you can find your way from there
 Caduceus could you make sure that she
gets some real food
 Interest intensifies
 That is heavily disarming
 Its like the worst controller youve ever
picked up at your friends house Youre like oh
Chocolate and Cheetos and all sorts of shit
  eight four
those
 Well I think well take her to the island
and then obviously give her a chance to continue
her adventure
 Well now Jester look I loved Kiri as
much as the next person So much just mm
 Yeah so great But I also dont want to
be responsible for anyone that cant take care of themselves
 She made a what
 Are we forgetting to describe things that
are of import on this ship She did what
 I wanted to see a Caleb laugh so bad
 Oh my god Like some horrible crash
 Okay so shes not entirely invalid
 What
 Thats right Jester you would not want
guilt over bringing in sweet Twiggy here to what
could be certain doom Thats what we do we seek
out certain doom
 Yeah
 Tell the truth now
said very important to always tell the truth
 Well you said you got that nice little
sphere there anything else we should know about maybe
 Fun ball of tricks yes I will not forget
again Anything else we should know about that
people might wish they had instead of you
have sticky fingers I hold them up and theyre
covered in chocolate
 Caduceus had it last
twirled
 Oh great
 Jester Im going to leave you in charge
of Twiggy all right Weve got to make for this
island You keep an eye on her I dont want to
see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters you
understand Twiggy
 Okay
 All right youre in charge
 Yeah of course Feel free to lend a
hand
 No youre not the only one I dont trust
that shit
 That saccharine Yeah you need some salt
to balance that shit out
 Whats a pomeranian
 Maybe we throw her overboard
 When you were down there with her did she
try any shady shit
 Right Okay
 Yes
 Apparently
 Yes Yes I will
 Are you up for it Lot of responsibility
Youve got to like cosign for the boat and shit
 Shake on it
 All right first mate
 Ah Fucking Cobalt grip
 Its all right Im kind of immune now I
just take it
 I feel so special
  Thats my call 
Forward deck
 We need to change it to the Balleater as
quickly as possible Nott I need you to hang over
the side of the ship with a paintbrush
  inches above the water and change the
name of the ship to the Balleater
 Can you do it
Again this hand comes off of my own hand I flick
it and it flies off and it comes and picks up the
paintbrush I lean over the side and it goes down
and starts to change your title for you without
having to risk his life
 On who
 I thought it was on me I was like

 Youre a temporary pirate now
 Its a great honor dont mess it up What
were you saying
 Yeah I was going to say we probably took
stock of any colors we have that we can run up
that arent associated with the Squalleater
 We still have some fire damage on the
boat though Were going to play that Our flag
was burned
 Get the fuck out of here What Thats so
old
 Is it only  I thought it was 
 Oh no
 Your hands
 Ill be showing Beau the ropes
firstmanning the ship
 Oh my god
 Shit I totally fucking forgot about that
The first time we got on the boat
 I dont think we were here
 No Thats a kill shot
 Oh thats right
 Oh shit Upgrade
 Instant death
 Kiss of death
 Its just black
 Yeah Ill come running down Yeah what
is it
 You dont have to announce it when you
show up Dont yell your superiority Well get
you a shirt or something
them into the hole You hear it hit
 Rope
 I got  feet of rope
 Put your hand in there
 Im reach down and put the tip of my
finger in the hole
 Just feels cool
 
 Like a personsized hole
 Oh My goodness You must have proved
yourself greatly
 We vote on the name every couple of
months but its going to be a while
 Well she needs a hat
 Every pirate needs a hat
 Same size
 Im sure itll be fine
so that its lit I attach it to a string I go
and I start to lower it down the hole and see if
it does anything
 I think so too but youve got to do it
quick because its going to stop real quick
 Do it do it
 Yeah its been about twice a minute each
time
 Jester and Beau boulderparchmentshears
Figure out whos going to put their head in and
help us see it
 Ill grab onto her britches as shes doing
it
 Down to her feet
 Do I look the same
 Start speaking in Latin
 Theres a watermark up here I can see it
Its amazing
 Oh I dont believe Matt I dont believe
it
 Weve got to figure out what all this
stuff is first I mean just so its not a pole
and a pair of shitty boots
 With that symbol on the back
 Have any of us heard that name before
 Archibald or
 Beau when you hit that buffer did it
feel hard and solid or was it soft and earthen
 Did you find a portal into somebodys
wardrobe
 Well at least its the same place each
time so if it does close off we at least know
how to find you
 Youre going in
 Yeah youre really good at finding
stuff
go or Ill go with you Want to go together
 When she was yelling on the other side of
the portal was there any sound that came between
the two Between the portal Nothing
 Or if youre ready to come back tug twice
on the rope
 Really
 Youre so brave
 Youre full of shit arent you
 As a note the previous function of the
sphere we can access Or is it one function at a
time as it changes
 Howd you escape
there and I would think and I would practice all
of my tricks I was able to get him to watch my
trick He thought that I ran down that way but
really I was hiding in the back I snuck out and
I ran the other direction I was able to run run
run Ive been running ever since
 It sounds real familiar
 I have a plus ten
 Green lights never good
 And they never come back
 How many times did you mess with it Like
six
 Whats it do Whats it do 
 All four symbols are the same on all four
banners
 Not in the middle Matthew
  I want to be by the corpses
 Let it build
 As Caleb flies backward Ill summon the
falchion and take a defensive stance
 Did the burst that came from the blue make
it all the way across the room to the green
 It just detonated on the other tapestry
 In the haversack right
 Ill do it
 Yeah
 Who are the locals
 Oh Yeah forgot you can do that
 Which one
 The one closest to you
 Yeah ditto that shit
 Yes Thank you Taliesin
 No Im trying to put it on Does it fit
 Im fucking fit okay
 That is an excellent way to try and figure
out what the fucks going on in here
 An observation deck
 You know its just a thought but if we
have to open two of these that are facing each
other at the same time so they destroy each other
well probably have to drop that down
 Well get there
 I like it
 What about sound
 That is really resourceful
 Where did her gum come from
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Yeah me too
 Do it
so I can see it and Im going to put just my hand
outside of the area of the hut
 You dont need that hand you got another
one
lean my head out
 Ooh shit
 Red doors are bad
 Proceed
little bit It comes down and it grabs a knob A handle
 Why
 Can I search the pockets of the red coat
 Seven
 No pockets
 Well we havent pulled the black curtain
back yet
 Yeah were fine
 Well were not going anywhere in here
Who wants to come with
 Jester Nott yall okay
 They just turn on you that fast
 Okay

 That was well used my man
 As we turn around and look at the door
that we came back through are there any markings
above the door or around it
  No 
 Twiggy  feet behind everyone else
 Ill go after Jester
 

 
 Im not looking at your notes Im just
looking through the wall
 Caleb passes out
 You say the stained glass window was on
which wall
 Gotcha Thank you
 Ill climb up the ladder and get just
under the stained glass window
 Can I see through the glass or at the
glass or is it above me
 You and your damn loft positions
Taliesin
 Whats that
 Ah Ah
closed cabinet Can I go look
 Okay then
 
 Yeah
 A small ruby circle
 Does it blink shine shimmer move
 Confused by its location Im gonna
touch it
 Yep
 Because I do stupid shit
 Why does he got to describe it and make it
sound so interesting
 What about me Matt
 Im going to do it 
 Youre not going to whale on this cabinet
bro
 May be Taliesins
 I love it when the DM describes something
as too realistic
 Would the cabinet have a French accent
when it talked
 I have been here for so long
  Probably not important
  Whats your name 
Whats your name
 What a fucking bunch of idiots we are
Its so good
 And then there were three
 Just the two next to that one
 Oh shit Natural one
  Im okay Im a fucking
sailor Im okay I miss Grog
 I apologize

 I seem to have stumbled somewhere where I
am not welcome
 If you would simply point towards the
exit I would be most obliged
 Can I be entirely honest with you
 I have recently been putting my hands
where they dont belong This time it sent me to you
 Probably to look and not touch
 Well you know I do have a very salty
variety myself Ill summon the falchion in my hand
 Now listen I dont want to disturb you
any further Im just going to see myself out
stage left over here You have a nice day and
enjoy your vast fortune Ill start to walk
towards that left tunnel
 Whered you get that impression Natural
one
 Yeah small tears
 Thats funny Ive actually heard that
name before Halas We saw some of his belongings
Before you devour me like a tiny little shrimp
would you mind a small request in letting me know
who that person was
 I am charismatic   Natural

 Cool when there are six others seven
others 
 An arrangement you and he
 How does he send you these I assume
incredible gifts
 I dont want to bring up a touchy subject
but I feel like your friend might be dead
 Manor Are we in a house
 Jeez You know I hate to leave you
without a friend I mean if this guys up and
left you high and dry maybe I could offer my
services
 
 I was trying to draw that shit out
 You have no idea how happy I am to see
you Dragon
 Damn it Ooh
 I started to take a step to the left while
facing the dragon
 Did he
 
 Why do warlocks only have two fucking
spell slots right now
 Im going to focus on the dragon because
my friends are here and Im going to cast Blink
 It is not
 And with my bonus action I will set
Hexblades Curse on that blue dragon
 All right
 No Blink was my action

 Just hope it listens to what you say

 Fiftyfuckingfive
  Oh Matthew

I fall in Im still in interdimensional space
 Boom Ah
  misses
 Get me the fuck out of here Were level
seven Why did we do this
 Yeah That was a good gamble
 Were all bouncing
 The monks like Really
 Ten feet closer to the end of the
hallway
 I will use all  feet of my movement to
head toward the end to see what the fucks down here
 Did I learn anything I dont know what to
do Ill turn around and Ill fire two Eldritch
Blasts at the dragon

 Great Second one is

on myself and smash my head into the crystal
 Its cold damage
 Im going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself at th level

  I smash my head into the
crystal
 Can I use my movement now to run up
towards the tunnel where Caduceus is in the
direction that the light moved If I roll less
than an  on Blink does the spell end or is it
every turn
 Okay great
 Well apparently I am fucking terrified I
shit my pants and I cant Blink
 Hope its home
 Yeah assume  pointsll miss
 Its just a dragon and a fire elemental

going to fire two Eldritch Blasts at the dragon
trying to get its attention
  and a 
 Seven points of Eldritch Blast Ten So 
total
 
 Do I have to roll blink if I dont

action

 When you come back remember its ten feet
from where
 Its looking hurt
 Oh yeah theres nobody in there

will put me in his melee will it
 I will use my bonus action Misty Step with
the sword to  over to the globe
 I will reach out and touch someone
 Okay
 Its the worst playroom ever
 And you can choose
 Mercy kill

 Please tell me the dragon cant touch the

animation takes a long time
 Whos hurting real bad
 No nobody
 What are the rules of drinking hard liquor
on Twitch
 Nott you took that with  hit points
 Yeah roll that shit Caduceus
 Where are we
 Marius do me a favor Just tell us how
much repairs cost and lets all settle in for the
night Were going to Still on fire
 Were going to need it
 Yeah
  gone
 How many
 Well lets just call that lesson learned
yeah Maybe we should all reconnoiter in the morning
 The good news is is that if Twiggy
actually killed the dragon which you obviously did
 We can go back
 Yeah it sounded bad when it came out
the most fun adventure Ive ever had in my lives
and you guys are the bestest friends that Ive
ever had and I think you should keep the Ball of
Fun but Id be very careful because Sir Cadigans
after it I better keep moving so I might get off
here you guys
 As an honorary member of The Mighty Nein
just do us a favor and make sure you tell your
story far and wide yeah
all that I meet
 Make good life choices
 Shes leaving us its the best life
choice
 Yep
 Right Id say something about that that
doesnt kill you makes you stronger but I feel
pretty fucking weak right now
 That was a dragon
 That little crazy Ball o Fun is a
troublemaker Just like Twiggy
 Maybe we just leave that particular
function alone for a while and collect some gold
to recoup our repair costs
 Oh shit
 Yeah if a big blue finger comes through
the hole well know Twiggy lied
 Im going to go get rid of this concussion
now
 All right first mate you got the con
 
 Yeah thats awesome
 As you do
 Thats what I was going to ask What time
is it
 We just started and we slept in all the
way till noon
 You can take your backpack off
 Well I suppose we should mosey out and
get the lay of the land as it were
 I dont know why Im like this I slept
real heavy mmkay

 What else could it be
 Yeah Ill relay all that stuff in my own
little bit each time I come by here so there
could be new stuff I havent seen before Worth a look
 What about paper Arent you always
needing papier
 Yeah of course
 All right fair enough Wheres Jester
 How are you doing this morning Jester
 Yeah
 You want to go out and explore a little
bit
 Are you okay I know the days escapades
were a bit much Little close
 Yeah well you did too Every time I
popped into wherever I was I could see you pop in
and then pop out and I kept wanting to go make
sure you knew we were getting the fuck out
 Oh Yeah well it was the damnedest thing
I just touched it Like you know Didnt know if
it was rough or smooth or cold Didnt expect to
be like  ah None of that shit Boop
 Maybe I wont do that so much anymore
 Yeah What are you grinning at goblin
 Are we not all intrigued by things that
dont belong or seem out of place
 Yes thats fair
 I didnt even ask What was in the room
before I got ripped out of there
 Wait a minute When I disappeared you
didnt immediately come and try and find me You
went and got stuff
 Hmm
 Yeah thats true
 How about I just keep my hands in my
pockets going forward into strange new rooms by
longdead wizards potentially
 I think I got a button around here
somewhere
 Thank you yeah
 Need that uplifting yeah
 I appreciate that
 That is a great idea In fact you should
lead the way I have a feeling youll be able to
find the best spot
 Oh the gangplanks its right over there
First mate show them how
 Do you know where the fucking exit is
Because I might not
 As we make our way by can I identify a
lowranking member of one of the crewmen of one of
those ships as theyre perhaps reaching for a
bundle or something
 You there By gods you guys are stocking
up something fierce
 Amazing Do you mind if I ask where all
this traffic is going
 Oh I understand Im sorry to hear its
moving so aggressively Are you concerned or do
you feel strength in your numbers
 Im sorry to hear that Just in case our
travels take us in your direction is there any
particular route or island that we should avoid
just to stay out of your hair
 That should be far away from where were
heading I wish you a safe journey my friend
 Thats where they attacked yeah
 Yeah we might return to a different
empire
 Yeah
 Yeah theyre from outside Nicodranas
 I think they have bigger fish to fry
Plus we got a new boat right
 No indeed
 Yeah it is one born out of circumstance
We have every intention of paying I just havent
received the bill from my first mate yet
 You definitely dont
 Ill take care of it Im the one touching
little red things 
 
 Yeah when they came and cleaned it out
after the fucking razzledazzle
 I cut my gold in half holy shit
 Yeah
 Here is your  gold Thank you for your
careful inspection and repair of the ship
 Oh in the next day or two were just
getting our bearings about us again Well be out
of your hair shortly
 I would love to tell you yes friend but
the best I could do is let you know before sundown
 No
 We have stuff we have to do dont rush us
out of here
 Ooh nice Yeah well find you I promise
well be as expedient as possible
 Walk inland
 Yeah and eyes up as we pass things along
the way
 Weve got to make more of a fuss about
that thats pretty cool
 Yeah and so does the stuff that you make
I just assumed you were conjuring you know sea
pigeons and stuff
 Seitan
 Quinnwah
 Are we relatively free of furtive glances
as we make our way through
 Jester can I make you a plate
 Okay cool Should we bring Caleb some
food
 Its sweet youll like it
 Dont look at me Im shit broke
 How many glasses did you have
 Ren faire ah
 Three oclock
 She was on the boat Beau
 But we did make you this plate of food
 Ill go over and find Bentha and be like

Can we get one more plate of food please
 Ill hand that plate of food over to Nott

There you go No its not for you
 Were fitting to explore a little
 Thats not
 Maybe some weapons or some potions that
might help should we find ourselves
 I mean I would like to yeah I saw it in
my visions and I havent had any other dreams
since I feel like this might be a good chance to
put a dagger in it you know Finish it up
 Yeah I have a feeling its right in the
middle of the archipelago thats just south of
here Maybe a day and a half maybe two days most
depending on
 Just a little bit and then we can go back
to land Nott With the promise of land and no
more requests to go to sea if youll do this for
me I would be most obliged
 Thank you Nott
 He was saying theyve made their way south
into the fucking town of Nipple Bottom
 Felderwin yeah
 Yeah weve been right near that area
 Oh
 Its far more south than theyve been
previously
 Really That maybe changes things
 Point Oh That is pretty far west
 They were going down the southern coast
yeah
 Most likely in an effort not to get
flanked
 Well I dont feel quite as energetic
knowing that where you both are from is under siege
 It may only add a day or two at most I
would be most appreciative
 I dont know I just thought Id feel it
out when I got there all current and past events
taken into account
 No no god no No I do have two of
these spheres and I cant help but notice the
extra shamalamadingdong that Avantika got by
depositing one of them I could keep the third and
certainly keep that crazy fucking snake at bay I
would like to see this through Otherwise I feel
like Ill always be wanting to get back here
 Right but he could be fucking anywhere I
want to do this because were here We can worry
about that later its a wide wide world
 We might have to go through Port Damali
actually Nicodranas is a little hot for us But
we could We could let your mom know that youre
okay
 Well maybe see how you feel when were on
our way back We wouldnt want to go around the
southern tip thats where the troops are heading
I feel like danger might be that way It might be
best to go the way we came
 So maybe some supplies Something to buff
us up a bit
 Some bees yep
 Yasha is there anything you need while
were in port Anything youve been craving while
weve been at sea
 We didnt have any idea that that was
going to happen
 Well lets make it an even seven like a
week right Because that spheres pretty fucking
sweet Not that I have any interest in messing
with it any further
 Well yeah just a little There were
fucking treasure troves in there Not that Im
interested in that Im all for playing it safe
Measured Practical Thats my middle name Fjord Practical
 Fjord Practical
 Are there any potion shops around here
 No bigs No sweat
 Are you going to show us the notches on
your upper delt for all the ones that you

a push I just touched it
 Before we go on the bee tour if theres
any time do we see any magic shops Weaponry
 
 So theres definitely one here
 Three Competing for the same turf
 Oh fuck
 I put a lot of healing potions into my
group

 This is fucking unexpected the skies were
pretty clear
 Huh That is one smart cow
 Of course Storm sails it is On the

 Why arent they up already 
 Orly do you see any way around this
storm or just through it
 Unacceptable Push through
 Safe practical measured
 I had advantage on it already 
 Oh does it
 Okay 
 No Ill stay up
 At the helm
 No get some rest I might need it in a
bit when this dies down
 Rage doesnt raise it
 Me
 Ooh 
 Oh shit thats only the second time I

 Steady
 Thats right
 Plus your rage damage
 d on the second one
 Oh thats a lot
 Beforehand yeah
 Ten
 Jester get the hell out of there
 It hit you anyway you might as well do
it because youll get reckless back
 Do you have any bonus actions
 Both strikes
 For divine fury
 Yeah but the sword has necrotic right
Or your shroud
 Oh sorry Yeah just once
 Do you have a bonus action
 Features and traits
 Check your features and traits
 Its all pretty awesome
 Yes you drop their speed to zero
 But if you make it reckless its a
straight roll
 Come on
 How far away is it from you on that mast
 One below your AC
 Strength has advantage
 Jester whats going on down there
 Maybe see to the repairs first before you
get your fucking tea
 Less steady
 I may send Orly or someone else below
decks to go wake up Beau
 Yeah were through the worst of it
Listen if for some reason Yasha comes back up
and starts swinging at a bunch of balls of light
on the front of the ship just dont get involved
Im going to sleep
  Nothing just going

 Hey nice job
 Really
 Which direction are we pointed
 Which is
 Orly
 Nice job
 Plot a course that would put us right in
the middle of all three
 It was the Squalleater
 Its not our fault
 Real poorly 
 Were going to head for the middle of all
that
 Maybe Were going to keep our eyes on the
islands as we proceed but I do recall it being
under the depths
 In my dream I saw from the top down and
I hit the water right in the middle of them and
kept going deeper and deeper
 Mmhmm
 Yeah
 Nope Nope nope She put hers in the
first temple I have two This might be numero
dos and then Ill keep the third
 Wait Four spheres three temples
 Thats right and as Caleb can attest to
that image that we saw in the temple was three
spheres Three chosen people underneath the
entity I dont think they would have an influx of
spheres to deal with
 Nott you are a fantastic rogue You
wouldnt let such an ambush befall us would you
 Those that want to come can I will
understand if you want to sit this one out
 Agreed and I couldnt guarantee your
safety up here while were below the murky depths
 I hear there is an ancient button factory
at the bottom of the waters
 Youve heard of it as well
 The storys been lost to the ages since
the great Calamity
 Youre in
 Fair enough Just in case can we keep an
eye on the islands as were moving in for any sign
of structures civilization
 Ill send the perceptive fuckers up to the
crows nest
 Youre aiding Cad
 If we havent seen anything on land Id
like to get in the middle and then send him below
 In my mind pictures Yeah I did
 Yeah
 Well Caduceus youre definitely coming
 All right
 Yes
 One thing we should do
 can I get you guys
to scurry up to the crows nest one more time and
give a gander for any ships
 Yeah Look really carefully
 coves
inlets anything that might look like it might be hiding
 Totally fine Were safe
 No It just seems like the obvious
entrance
 Yeah

 Sorry my impulsiveness was starting to
catch up again I just want to be honest 
Doesnt seem like theres a trap Nott right We
seem to be by ourselves at least up here
 Yeah but I mean whats a couple of dead
bodies on seaweed to people like us No bigs right
 About what time of the day is it right
now
 Lets get this thing done
 I do
 Up for another scrap
 All right Ill look at the group and I
will cast Underwater Breathing on everyone for  hours
 Whats the distance from the middle of
this archipelago to the nearest outer island
 Ill go to Orly and say
 While were
underneath if you see another ship enter or
danger present itself make for land and well
find you
 You ready
 When we get under make sure to take a
breath really quick youll sink faster
 He wont
 He wont
 
 
 Its clear water
 Does it look like it has four appendages
 Oh no
 We cant HALO drop in this bitch
 Yeah we can pair up
 Or at least two Theres five
 Pretty sure They look like theyre on the
look yeah
 Whos got a good range Whos got some
good pop on a good range You
 Does the water do anything to it
 There is one that is free
 How close do you need to be Caleb
 Im more of a fan of them coming to us
frankly
 Lets get in range of whatever Caleb needs
to do and then lets break off into three and four
 They can pick but theyve got to come to
us
 Lets get within whatever you need 
feet  feet Well try to stealth within that range
 Spread out  feet between us the two
groups Clerics with each group
 All of them at the same time
 Wizards choice How about just one and
you pick
 Ill also send Eldritch Blast
  and a 
  points of Eldritch Blast
  to 
 Two One
 Oh well then you top me
 Yeah Plus zero
  feet
 Whoa
 Is it just hers at advantage or all
attacks against it
 I will join Beau just in case someone
decides to fuck around
 Ill fire the first two Eldritch Blasts at
one of them thats swimming though not the one
thats in melee of her
 That sucks Thats a one and a two so I
think both of those fucking miss Thats incredible
 Ill fire the next two
 Because Im hasted so I have a second
attack
 Oh shit
 Yeah I guess Ill just
  summon the falchion and take a swing at
it
 Its a two I do nothing Nothing
  Shitty rolls
 What the fuck
 Fucking Bane man
 How many are up still
 So heres a question that very first one
that we lit up like the Godfather
 With my bonus action can I reach out
since I was part of the killing of are these
creatures humanoids
 Can I reach forward and go
 in a demonic
voice Rise and Ill Accursed Specter the creature
 Ill say that and go 
and throw two more Eldritch Blasts at the one
thats remaining
 Thats a 
 The other one is a 
  This is the age of Aquarius
Thats ten points and eight So 
 Great Ill take my speed and rush at it
 Take a strike
 Oh dope 
 d plus two points of damage One plus
one
 Its d plus one
 I dont see that on here
 I aint been doing it
 I thought it would be added into the
weapon naturally
 Yeah it just says d plus one
 Okay
 My charisma bonus is four
 Yeah So it would be six on a two
 Okay
 Mmhmm
 We have a friend
 Ill bring the specter forward
 I feel bad having Frumpkin be the one
thats always putting himself in harms way
thought Id give him a friend Ill send the
specter towards the mouth of the tower
 Mmhmm
 Nope
 I just wanted to send him to the
entrance
 Yeah just to the front
 Just to make sure the towers not like

 Dont make that face I wouldnt put that
past you for one second
 Its not a permanent thing
 Just give it a try
 Ruhroh hey kids
 Yeah Well move closer
 Im a bit faster Ill go
 Hang back for a second Ill use  feet
of my speed to move forward
 Im still fucking Hasted
 Oh does it Sorry
 Now I have one level of exhaustion
right
 Are we above it
 Its at an angle right
 Id like to spiral down slowly making my
way around the top so I can see
 Stealthily
 What is that for
 I do get advantage
 Thats good Ugh Nine
 
 The top of the tower is open and it
continues through the middle
 I swim over to the edge of the tower to
try and lean up against the side of it Make
myself less obvious out in the open water
 Does somebody appear
 Well dont want to go in that way I wave
everybody down
 I will relay that there is a doorway down
near the bottom but something poked its pretty
head out
 Kind of greenishyellow Couldnt quite
see but it kind of looked like an overgrown
shrimp crabtype thing Kind of crustaceany
 Yeah Might just be the local wildlife
right What are the chances We could just send
our guest here down
 Or we could go through the tunnel
 Id be fine with that I will command the
specter to move towards the doorway and engage
anything it finds
 Just at the doorway
 I push him inside
 Commotion
 Balls Ass Three
 I dont know theyre pretty resilient
but okay
 Well lets assume then shall we assume
flanking positions
 You know if its crustaceany and its
treating this tower as a shell maybe I dont want
to fight it in there
 How about we drop to the floor about 
feet from the doorway and send in a care package
 Yeah Anything ranged
 See if we get lucky
 Ill descend to the floor keeping about
 feet from the outside of the doorway
 You got a fluffernutter ready to go
 Well I dont even know why youre down
here
 I am
 Youre on the floor right
 Whats that do again

 The club punch Bitch
 Walk away with some weave in your hand
 A little slice
 I dont know if I believe you
 Actually if we went inside then at least
anything thats swimming overhead with big teeth
might not see us
 That would be great Yasha do you see
anything in there  No

 Error 
 Deuce do you want to take a look make
sure that its not the ravenous variety
 Ill help Caleb over to the door
 Yeah we have  hours of breathing so
were okay
 Yeah lets get inside
 Jester that was very impressive I must
say
 And the use of the lollipop Really nice
stuff
 Well be inside
 Yashas back up to full
 Careful as you head out there You dont
know whats above you
 I dont want to disturb the fauna Is
there a more genteel way to make our way through
 Jester you find anything on that guy
 No pendants or necklaces or keys
 Yeah lets do that Yasha will help you
pull the body back in
 Who Yasha and her
 I dont mind
 All right
 Is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff
on it Keys
 Im real good at these
 Thats cocked Thats worse  no yeah

 Lets pick it up Maybe we can offer it as
a gift to the  as we make our way down
 Okay Are you grabbing the tendrils Ugh
 Caduceus you okay with us chunking this
into the
 What
 I meant we were going to toss the body
into the seaweed and let it have a snack
 Oh okay I thought it was the gnarly
kind
 Oh okay never mind Sorry I
misunderstood
 Hello bees
 
 Theyre very smart
 Ive seen a place like this once before
when we were in the temple previously with
Avantika If you will help me you could search
the floors and the walls for any sort of recessed
sphere shape
 I think it needs to be about yay big
 Well if we find we something that looks
like the previous situation then maybe we could
send some of us out of here before we put the key
in the lock
 No As far we know I dont think it
will
 I dont think so I think its to get the
three spheres in the three temples She did hers
and died I have the second and the third but
thats my logic I must concede I dont know how
many temples there are Im only going off of that
art that we saw in the temple
 Now unless theres two holes in here
There should only be one in theory
 No
 How do I do that Jester
 Does he answer you when you talk to him
 He does
 Would you ask him if he knows anything
about this
 I dont know what agate is What does
agate look like
 Its a seethrough glass or is the same
color
 Well I figured were in a safeish space
I dont know We can do it on the ship
 My question to you oh They could see us
through the glass sphere
 Thats okay We can do it on the ship
With that crazy investigation check of yours did
you find any recessions in the floor
 Just one
 I dont recognize that armor do I
 Does he look like his appendages are all
attached Any cracks on the skull or face or any
sort of
 Me
 Yeah Hey Jester could you make a
 Thank you
 Natural 
 Maybe it got crushed by the pincers and
then crawled down here where they couldnt follow
 I think I need to do it alone If Im
going to risk getting out quickly I dont want
you to have to do the same Theres only one
recession in here so one sphere
 I do have my mariners armor I have my
normal speed
 Sure I dont think theres anything else
to do

 Im not going to turn evil Im not going
to turn evil I rub my cut earlobe
 Now look I think were overthinking it
right Same as before I anticipate some crazy
arcane stuff to activate Maybe a little rumble
and a shake You guys have been more than
accommodating You dont need to be down here with
me when it happens If something does go wrong
that should be my burden my price to pay not
yours
 I dont think it will and only because
if Ukotoa really wants me to do all of this for
him what good would trapping me down here do I
have the third sphere I dont think hes going to
hamstring me like that
 No I dont but I wouldnt gum up the one
person that was bringing me the thing that I
needed to get out of demigod jail
 Yeah Id like to I dont know what that
looks like I dont even know how thatll go but
I dont want to release a seasnake beast on the
world
 Yeah
 Yeah fair enough
 If you hear the signal take off You
remember the signal right
 
 Can I go and sit down right in front of
Jester
 Well whatd he say
 Kind of You had a little projection on
it yeah
 Jester
 You dont have to tell me its fine I
appreciate the sentiment Its okay you can go
 Me too
 Or anyone else Just you
 Deal
 All right get going
 I dont know what that does
 I will kneel down in front of the
recession and I will look at the eye thats in the
pommel of the falchion  Lets see
what this does And Ill place it in the recession
 Time to go Ill head towards the tunnel
 I rolled a seven
 Where is the ship
 Jester I didnt know you could mess with
water like that
 No
 Oh Im forgetful
 I mean it worked
 Would I know if I got something new
 Do I know what it is
 I mean I can try Ill reach my hand out
towards the sea and lift up my hand
 Cleaning herself on her balcony
 Yeah I think were good
 Make for the coast Orly Weve had enough
time at sea
 Really cool shit
 What the hell is durian
 Yeah
  What is that
 

 Ugh
 On a course to intercept Starboard
port
 No were dropping all the sails Were
getting the fuck out of here and Im going to use
Control Water to push the back of our boat out the
fucking archipelago
 North Northeast the way I imagine
thats the closest one If theres a closer
opening yeah
 Yeah
 Make ready the cannons
 Yeah Whats the distance from the ship
If we had to guess it
 Okay
 I have no idea whats an appropriate
range
 We couldnt just get to land goddamn it
 Just kidding
 Taliesin do you have any idea what the
range on a cannon is
  or 
 Okay We have seven cannons
 I am reading this card
 Each of us get two what
 Right which is a singular cannon shot
with additional loads of powder
 Seven
 Four on the port three on the starboard
but we dont know which side theyre on
 Are we both facing the same direction
right now
 So are they on the starboard right now
 Yeah 
 Run or fight say it now What do you want
to do
 Yeah I did but youve already risked a
lot for me
 Well see how fast they are Well turn to
flee into the water
 Yes
 Probably faster
 
 Oh she got a three No five
 
 What The ship had a 
 Mines not Its up for ten minutes and
its at the back of the boat
 Oh well there you go
 Yep
 I have no idea I dont have any visual of
where we are in relation to anything
 The coast off to starboard
 No were still out of range
 Were still out of range by  
yards
 Sure yeah lets aim to hug the coast on
the starboard side
 That is a three
 Negative two to survival checks yall
 No Five yes so three
 Is our hull at full strength
 Okay I got that
 How close do you need them
 Uhhuh Were hugging the coast Were
going to continue in that same line We need  anyway
 With a tidal wave
 Yeah its a wave
 No
 Im glad we went through all that so I
could get that spell once a day
 Make it so
 Turn to port Prepare to fire Smoke these
motherfuckers
 Yeah after we splinter the ship
 They obviously had some sort of wind in
their sails
 I mean theyve got some arcane people
Theyll be fine if the can survive this barrage
 Yeah there was a  percent chance it was
going to fucking fail and we were going to turn
to port and get into it
 Were realizing the amount of hours that
must have gone into the detail of this
 Because Im reading into targeting the
helm or the sails or the cannons
 They tried their hand at a new occupation
 Oh Im so glad  No It
cant be
 We even did another job
 Nice call Taliesin Nice call
 Do you want to go close and toss out a
rope for a couple
 How many manacles do we have
 I dont fucking know How many manacles do
we have Master gunner
 Well be okay I forget do we have any
firearms or did the Plank King dock crews clear
all that out
 Its not like theyve got Im sure
theyre not swimming well well see Lets get
them up
 Fortunately you found us on a day of
mercy You have a second chance at life Is there
anywhere you would like to go
 I am
 Captain Tusktooth
 Til the end
 Thats a better name Better name
 We planned to make our way for the
Menagerie Coast Do you have any objections with that
 Excuse us a moment Yes master gunner
 You mean Nicodranas Yeah but were
betting on the fact that they do I think if we
go into Nicodranas we need to be as stealthy as
possible Theres a chance they might not take it
We should probably drop them off at the island
give them some food
 Well go into Nicodranas stealthily
 Thats my fear I like the way youre
thinking
 I can
 I dont know if I want to risk it Orly
make for the shore of the nearest archipelago coast
 Yeah just going in No rowboat
 How about one stays on deck and hes
going to carry the canvas sack with some food rations
 In order to eat youve got to get the
mark
 Its not optional
 How about his face
 What you dont want a unicorn pooping on
his face
 Oh my fault Jester
 Oh Jesus Well hes covered in most
places so pick your spot
 Give them the food Beau will you show
him the door
 I actually dont need to dive down there
I cant breathe water again for another until we
have a long rest
 Orly can we set a course for Nicodranas
by way of Brokenbank
 Oh just going by the normal trade routes
just in case we I dont know run across any trouble
 How are we on supplies Food water
Anyone sick hurt
 Its the next stop on an established
shipping lane
 If were set I think maybe a speed route
would be great Nicodranas
 Nice Ill throw in some Control Waters
once every day
 Caleb
 Thats it
 I think thats the plan Caleb you want
to take time to Identify your goodies
 Not too shabby
 They die before we reach the shore What
No Kidding

 He jumps over
 I would I would like to ask Beau and
anyone else that lives in the empire if they could
tell me a little bit more about where they live
and who is the most concerned about the news that
we received about the war moving south
 Hes looking stuff up Youre from
 Right We came through the Wuyun Gates
 Right here
 Maybe well just see Its at the
discretion of everyone Once were off the boat
Im not the captain anymore I dont know where
the urgency lies
 Even with an army bearing down on it You
have family there
 Warn your folks Get them out of harms
way No
 Beau I want to honor what youve said
but you only get one family Are you sure that
whatevers transpired between you is too much to
drop a note
 You have a brother now
 No other siblings
 Arent you at all concerned that he might
be an innocent in all this He has your blood
running through his veins
 Maybe think about it Him at least Could
give the kid a chance
 Youll know what to do
 No I think were fine for a while My
first priority was getting Jester back to her
momma for a hot minute if we could
 I think were pretty sneaky Weve learned
some tricks Wouldnt hurt to check out the
fucking building that grows and shrinks as you
approach it
 If were heading up into the empire we
got to go through the Wuyun Gate anyway
 Yeah
 In searching the captains quarters would
we have discovered any sort of papier
 Yep all right well
 Or we go full sail into port crash into
the docks Caleb sets off Fireball as a diversion
we run in and hide among the corpses of the
innocents that are scattered about I have a problem

 Yeah Im good
 No I did have another vision It seemed
like Ukotoa was straining against whatever
confines it was in but not released I saw a
vision of another maybe final temple location
 I saw a shore with three cities along the
coast and then a forest beyond that Just before
you got to a rocky mountain ridge there was a
single glowing light
 It could be I dont really care for
now
 No and the thing I wanted the most was
in some of these I saw a vision of Vandran
whether as a statue or in a reflection or
something I didnt see anything Nothing
 Ive run out of leads there I dont
really know where that leaves me on that but
weve spent enough time on me I dont have
anything else to follow Besides theres danger coming
 Maybe we let a little bit of time go by
but thank you
 Not yet I feel like were good for a
while I couldnt tell you why Well see It
might be good to ask anyone if they know anything
about Ukotoa or if there are offsetting deities
or gods He seemed incredibly powerful and I have
to admit I was a little unnerved seeing him push
against his constraints in that way I dont know
Maybe theres more to be learned
 Just those single words He says things
like learn and adapt
 Could be
 Yeah I summon it
 Yes yeah
 Take it up into the Empire by way of
Nicodranas
 No no And if I can Id like to find
some way out of it
 Yes I like how I am now and to answer
its favor I dont know what the other side would
be like
 Yeah
 No I dont know
 
 No
 Im out of my depth I have no idea I
dont know any more than you do All I know is Im
ready to get off the sea for a bit Unless I hear
otherwise alls well No reason to assume otherwise
 Hes the most sterile hes ever been
 And you hear  as we give
away our location
 Yeah of course
 Fuck off

 Ah My backs popping
 An instant fucking bigass tree
 Its like a ladder
 Caduceus does I do
 Does it come with any protective
 I dont remember much
 Yeah well hold it for Yasha I bet its
giant
 Yasha drinks it immediately No
 Whoa
 Thats a thing That took me a long time
to get to that
 Should we get to work on forging those
documents for when we make our way in
 The mote The shred of fate or whatever
 I was like when did we start calling it
the mote
 Yeah but we dont need any sort of
official record tying us
 Orly
 In no less than  words describe to me
why you should have this ship
 Further inland What I think Im saying
You can sell it you can take care of it whatever
you see fit Youve done right by us
 That sounds quite agreeable Orly
 Thatll be all
 Bring him with us Make him fight
  No worryin now
 Yeah fluffy little clouds
  What
  What the fuck Leave it to
Taliesin to trip you out with shit you didnt know about

 Oh man That was awesome Im sorry that
we capsized the boat so fast
 Disadvantage the whole game
 We forged those documents right
 What was the ships name
 Okay just checking That makes sense
 Thats right Ignus
 I will Mask of Many Faces and give myself
a bald head with a nice little red flavor saver
right here and very expensive red and
goldlooking flowy stuff
 Not ostentatious or attracts
attention at all
 Someone might try to kidnap you
 This is the Balleater Its been quite a while
since we were in Nicodranas Im Captain Tristan
 We will probably be here for I dont
know an extended period of time We might make
our way up into the Empire Do you have any
extended rentals on the dock here
 Oh yes thank you Orly
Im so forgetful Yes
 Be well Orly Carry on
 That is very thoughtful of you
Thank you
 Access the memory banks 
 I think Caleb had something to say
 Sure Ill go to blacksmith with Caduce
 North of the Dunrock Mountains
would you say
 Thats fucking way up there
We are here and we got to go there
 Hundred miles
 So one two in a straight line three
four five six seven eight hundred miles if we fly
 I mean truthfully yeah
 You could yeah Then itd be
Beaubobows Bo
 Now that is something Beaus bos bow
 Ugh
 Is it bigger
 You assaulted a sevenyearold
I thought we were playing
 If its pink I kill it
 Shame on you
 Unless you want some privacy
 Long established
 Yeah Ill drop
 I think were good
 Very gracious of you
 Hurried circumstances I think would
sum it up We did have to borrow a boat A ship
 Thats true
 Well be landlocked for a while
Are you familiar with Darktow Isle
 Your daughter was very brave Our
adventure took us over there
 Yeah I dont think the Plank King
leaves very often
 Without a doubt Our travels took
us far and wide and we are all the more
excited to be back on land and to explore
this beautiful city that most of us
havent had a chance to really peek about
 Very much
 That sounds like what weve gathered
before Interesting I think thats where we want
to go next You notice as you walk towards it and
walk further away it looks like it grows and shrinks
 Well I was going to say
like a telescope
 You know it goes up and down it doesnt
lay over on its side and shrink up and then extend itself
 Im sorry Yeah we got sea dementia
Its really rampant
 We rip it out of her hand
Whats the first chapter say
 Jester makes a valid point We actually
probably should go first thing in the morning
so were all nice and rested and I would
enjoy a nice meal
 I dig it
 May the paint be with you
 Im sure there are some stores that might
have healing potions and other things we could
stock up on before the sun goes down and they
close up right Might as well take a gander
Ms Ruby do you have any sorts of shops you might
recommend that would have stuff of that nature
 Thats beautiful
 Im sure either of those will do nicely
 Shall we A little light shopping
 Yeah maybe not into the stores with
things that break and then we have to pay for it
 Hes certainly your dog Jester
Its your call
 Yes and bitch

 The Seafloor Bounty is over by the
 Ill buy one
 A real spitfire
 I got a feeling she had more fight in her
than youd think
 So before the sun goes all the way down
 I was going to say lets go look at the
tower
 Everythings chill
 Lets make our way over to the what was
it
 Mmhmm
 Sure do
 If I look up is that balcony that we saw
before about   feet above our heads
 Did what Make it appear And disappear
 Do a quick speed round and we walk around
the perimeter looking out for fucking windows and
balconies and we meet around the other side
 Oh How high up
  to  Yeah thats too high I mean I
can get up there but it makes a real big noise
 I mean I dont know whats inside there
 Yep and it would hurt a lot I imagine
Just from my simple knowledge of basic physics
 Yep
 But hey theres nothing that says if we
come back in the morning that son of a bitch
might be in a different place Ill bet you
crackfire slopdolly
 
 Yeah Pick wood
 Theres no way Thats not possible
 And it just looks like it grows and
shrinks and grows and shrinks
 Maybe
 I cant get up there without making a real
loud ruckus so tomorrow mornings our best bet
 What about the tree
 What about the tree
 But how does that work
 Immediately
 Thats a shitty plan
 Well theres no rule that says dont ride
up a tree and jump on a fucking balcony
 Try it
 Can I turn around and look at the
storefront Unless something happens when she knocks
 I turn around and look at the storefronts
Are there any that are obviously still open Right
across from maybe that are facing the
 Can I just jog over and try and find
somebody that might be working a desk over there
 What knockers Young Frankenstein just to
be clear
 Im at the fish mart
 Im at the fish mart
 You dont see a particular door that
appears every couple of days or is there a pattern
 Yeah all right Youre an observant one
Anything else that you can share that might help
me understand this structure more
 Pigeons Really unsanitary for these
fish
 How much
 Ill flip him four silver
 Wrapped in the paper stuff right Or is
it just the fish
 Oh Thank you
 Very appreciative You have yourself a
fancy fucking evening
 Success
 Yeah its a red snapper Anybody a fan
 Oh good
 What are you talking about
 Havent we been through enough that the
jokes are unnecessary at this point
 What little guy
 I grab the snapper by the tail and I start
gesturing Let me get this straight I went to ask
questions you knocked and some goblin came out
of what the balcony and started answering your
questions and then disappeared
 Is it still there
 You motherfuckers I dont need this shit
I toss it like SeaWorld
 Ducey Did this happen
 Really
 And you just knocked and a door appeared
 It just seemed so fantastic
 No I dont think thats it
 Lets not do that
 So we come back in the morning
 What information
 Ukotoa
 Uhhuh
 We walk in and we say Are you missing
anything
 That might be okay though Jester What if
we give it back and he answers us some amazing
questions or
 Well maybe we dont offer that right
away
 Yeah and we really should go back and get
some good dinner and some sleep so we can get
back here tootsweet
 Run doubledash back towards
the wizards tower
 I want to see the inside
 Ukotoa
 Yeah you better watch yourself
 Id like to know what he knows
if he knows more about Ukotoa
or maybe how to counteract him
 Maybe hes up for a friendly conversation
I dont think were your average fisherman
I mean weve seen some shit
 Yep of the utmost importance
 Check off a bunch of boxes
 Yeah fair enough
 Youre there
 So who did the knocking last time
 Did you do anything special
 Can you replicate it today
 Then get after it
 Powerwalking
 Grabbed her elbow
 Damn it
 We do have Earl
 We also have news of grave import
 We all bumrush it No Im good
Im not fucking with this one
 You plus one
 Three notes are ask about Ukotoa
I trust you make good decisions
 Yep
 What is it
 Youve got some high charisma right
 Yeah go in Go thats your fate
 Yes Good Excellent
  Fuck
 A bright green dragon
 Did that door just fucking open
 
 Jester Nott Fjord Caleb
 Im Fjord
 Im assuming hes talking about
the Happy Fun Ball
 I have no objection
 Is there anything that we can do
for you in the short term
 Well I think if he knew that
it helps us on our exploits
 Which thereby helps him I mean
we are sharing arent we
  Give us a helping hand
 Yeah
 Now

 In the hands of an assassin
 Yeah she talks to him
 And you die
 Just him and Caleb right
 Hey Caleb What happened in there

 You expose yourself
 She has a good point I thought wed
hurry back so that we could check
 Sounds like a deal
 We go through the Wuyun Gates
Trostenwald Zadash
 Are we going to Felderwin village
 Yeah I mean itd be Alfield really
Zadash is west of Felderwin
 Yeah Trostenwald by way of Alfield
and then well take the Rillway Road
 To Felderwin
 Its a straight shot
 Of course
 Do it
 Nope
 I think this is just a regular cart
 How many words Thats 
 Friend of mine
 Vandran
 How do you know that
 Is this the same as Jester talking to the
Traveler You hear from the Wildmother
 You asked about him for me
 He was making amends
 Thank you
 Off the path
 Im trying to sleep What are
yall doing
 Aw fuck
 Veering right
 Underground
 Were they able to repel these attacks
 Felderwin
 Indeed
 We should be on our way
 A bit quicker than we thought
Im afraid
 Good to see you
 Do you have any deposited checks
or bank statements
 Well done Virtuous indeed
 Thank you Bryce Thank you
 We should move quickly
 Nott give us a hyah
 There we go
 The Rillway Road and were going
to get to a bridge before we hit Felderwin
 You said they look like
someone we met previously
 Was the blue flash from him apparating
 Yes we are
 Nope I get two letters in
and thats all she wrote
 Lady Ve DeRogna
 Lasagna
 What is it Vess
 Nope not there Yeah Lady Vess DeRogna
 Thats a 
 Is there another way out of here
 Second set of stairs into the house
 Yeah Ill search with him
 
 And a picture and a picture
 We have a tripod
 Hundred percent
 We sent a message once
Is it worth trying it again
 Anything else in this room that we
need to turn over before we get out
 Put everything back in the chest and bring
it with us Put the chest in the haversack
 How was it locked from the outside
 You didnt see anything when you
sat in the chair right
 Why the chair Why in middle
of the room Why lock it
 We need to not use that
dodecahedron anymore
 You could send them to Alfield if you
wanted Im sure Bryce could take care of them
 If you dont feel comfortable here
you should tell them
 Worst case scenario they could go south
You could send them to Nicodranas Im sure
 It is I dont know how far or fast
this is moving
 Why the chair though
  What is the chair

 Did we put the chair in the
bag of holding
 First roll of the night no fucking
pressure First roll of the night you got this
 Yeah well stay Caleb are you
worried about another attack
 One or two
 Are you a goblin
 Do we know who we think that is
 Majority
 Thats actually very clever
 Further away Why dont we keep
moving upstream Whats the direction
away from the conflict
 Sure lets head south
 Before we go are you sure your
son is safe with this
 What did you tell her last
Are they staying Are they going
 Do other people in town know that old
Edith cares for your son that theyre connected
in some way
 I dont want to tell you what to do but I
feel like our previous experience would lean
towards getting your son and her out of here
especially if the people that have taken your
husband are still here If theyre searching
for answers or asking people questions
that could lead to her and him
 Nows the time to move them
 Maybe its not you Maybe one of us go
 Mmhmm
 If they do decide to cross I think
theyre less concerned with people going out
more than coming in
 If it does continue to drift that way
Bryce will be sure to get them out quick
 Theres a lot to figure This will
be one less thing to worry about
 This is going to Bryce
 Woman and child incoming
Take care of them
 Dont waste it on a stop
 Oh boy
 Bryce is shaking their head trying to
get better reception and its not working
 Because youre checking out around us
 Periscoping
 Snaps
 All right can we maybe circle back to the
 Maybe if you share with us your
apprehensions itll ease it a bit
 The head of the whole thing
 I mean I did Thats the center of magical
teaching in the Empire as I understood it
 Also I dont think a very bad person
would care about us
 This Trent does he know these two
that we saw
 How powerful are these two Our normal
tricks would they fall short
 So we need to give them a very wide berth
At the same time we need to figure out where
 Did he experiment
 Im sure hes alive but if he was good at
breaking things down taking them apart
experimenting on things this thing that we have
falls directly into that
 What do you mean
 What do you prefer
 We should ask to see if anyone saw a
carriage anything leaving town with Yeza
 Yeah
 It might not be the only one
 Pretty smart
 And also ring the dinner bell Jester I
think thats the more dangerous part Were super
close to the front line or at least to them You
do that we might get exactly what were asking
for but then trouble might also come calling
 I think so
 Its kind of like when you smile
 Youre going to have to do this twice
 So do we avoid your two professors
Or do we try to study them divide them
interrogate one of them
 You dont know that
 What I swallow shit and make it appear
in my weapons Im fucking down to throw
you know what Im saying
 You dont have to minimize my new shit
okay Im real proud of it Ive had it for a
fucking hot second
 Yeah maybe we dont try to separate him
Right Well what about the one that studies
history You met a bunch of really dangerous
historians
 What do I know man Im a fucking
sailor
 Listen Jester As much as I love this
its not about me okay
 So what do we do
 We need to send your son on his way
 Do we need to try and
 Do we want to ask if your husband was
spotted leaving by some sort of natural means
 Then we kill the two elves
 Yeah you seduce one Ill seduce the
other no problem I have a way with elvish folk
 Well deal with one thing at a time
 Have we talked about sending a message
 I mean if hes in Super Magical
Headquarters Im sure there might be protection
against that but
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah Your Wildmother the thing you did
for me
 No Nope No he has
 We can do that Cover of night Helps
 To the inn
 Im going au natural
 Four rooms Three
 You said with events being as they have
been We noticed theres been a ruckus recently
 Calm the last few days Any reason why we
should be apprehensive this evening
 I understand The aftermath we saw troops
leaving on our way in
 They catch any of those that were guilty
of all this
 Appreciate ya
 Thank you
 Ducey A florist
 Stop
 Let it ride
 That might know locals
 Demi Leric you say
  Come forth Come forth
 Brenatto
 Did you hear what was revealed in that
moment just now
 Are there specific areas where the tunnels
were collapsed after they went back in
and covered them up
 Yeah a lot of Jeffs right now are fucking
giving you the bird
 Yeah keep digging
 Couldnt hurt
 Cant they respond to your messages
 Or If youre alive just say ow
 Well go find a nearby crownsguard and see
if they can point us in the direction of where
some of those collapsed tunnels were
 Mmhmm
 Ill walk up Excuse me
 Yeah sorry were just passing by
We heard this was the scene of
all the unfortunateness
 Has it been cased this area Searched
for I dont know anything left over by the
invading hordes
 Whos they
 Fancy
 Oh I think I saw them 
What were they doing
 Fair enough You know if they found
anything took anything out of the dirt
 They tell you that these might open up
again or they might be in imminent peril
I see theres eight of you guys
 You were here
 Is that right
 My god that sounds terrible
 When you saw the 
big mouth with teeth Whatd you do
 Damn right fast as you could Ill bet
 Did it come out of the ground
or did it go back in after
 How big was this creature
 Wow thats significant Were you also here
or far away when they made their hasty retreat
 Keeping an eye out
 Could you see anything that was driving
them off or were they just taking their sweet time
as they left
 Weve come across these cricks before We
saw them in Zadash There was a big ruckus in the
middle of the city Trying to learn all we can 
I dont know when well come across them next
I feel like share and share alike you know
 
 Whyd they stop
 Pretty long
 I appreciate it We wont take up much of
your time We thought wed have a gander around
if thats all right
 Fair enough Being that fancy folk were
here I dont suppose theres any point in doing
our particular brand of searching
 The what
 What is that
 I dont talk to The Traveler
 Thats a good idea except for what if the
whole tunnels collapsed and we Blink into the earth
 I mean I imagine anything is possible
in this world of magic and mystery
but I bet it would hurt a lot
 I dont know about you but when I Blink
I can only appear about ten feet from where
I previously was
 Thats better
 Its sunken earth right
 Nope Oh youre doing your walk thing
 Any reason to use your radar and
see if anything was missed
 Anything magical Anything arcane
 Theyre still here
 No they bamfed in Didnt see them leave
 Yeah but we can kill them too
 Just as a warm up All right
 Do we want to abandon this tunnel 
I can jump forward  feet in a direction
 I dont know I think Ill get shunted
out
 Yeah that one
 In my minds eye
 Damn
 Nope that would have been out of form
for us No We dont do that
 Yes of course
 You did
 Are you talking about aligning ourselves
with the people that ganked your husband
 Unless you could dig underground
with a bunch of pet worms
 Maybe theyre baby steps
 Plus itd be super nice if you could take
the most powerful city in the empire and slow it
the fuck down before you attacked it
That might work
 Well get to the tunnel We need to get
her son out and then we can decide
What thing were you talking about poking
 Yep Thats what hes talking about
 Because its there to do
Normally all about that
 Dragon sucked
 I agree
 Carl Kevin Keep going
 Its a K sound
 You said we
 How many of them are there
  Yeah
 Herbal tea some melatonin something right
 Well Im going to bed
 You sang
 What do they look like
 Leave the table
  What
 They fucking out
 I mean what else are we going to do
 Maybe maybe not
 We dont even know if the tunnels are
accessible to us Why dont we see if they are first
 It was probably me Im very wise and agreeable
 Yeah we took that wrong turn at
Albuquerque right Well get back and
skedaddle out of there if we have to
 Yeah werent we more concerned about that
when we thought he was in Rexxentrum
 Why did you say that
 Usually on the anniversary of when they
were married Not just like youre married
Happy anniversary
 Mmhmm Better Yep
 Lets get your son out
 Lets go Son Lets get started
 Everythings fine Just going
to the beach for a bit
 Its up to you

 They took an oath and shit
 All your money
 
  Im just a pigeon

 Do we see any of the elven folk of the two that
we have been talking about while were walking around
 You do it as well
 Thats a one
 What
 Arrested
 Wheel it
 Were part of a research expedition We
were here and we were hoping we could toss you a
little bit of coin and you know check out this
area here a bit
 
 Its very boring actually Yeah Quite
tedious You use little picks and little brushes
and we covered little
 You take a while and then you brush it
and spit on it you know Did you want to join
 Its really quite relaxing Actually my
friend over here can attest to it
 Yes
 Nope
 Three Deal
 We kill him
 The size of a dog
 Honey badger does not come up
 Be an elk
 Be an elk and kill all of these fucking
soldiers 
 Unretracted
 Its all normal down here how are you
 Gil
 And we all instantly die
 No
 Uhhuh
 Yeah they all float down here
 Or you could go check it out by yourself
and see what it is
 Jester
 We didnt Identify it though did we
 Going through
 
 Sorry I tripped My fault
 A boat
 I have this boat dagger I throw it at the
wall and 
 Yeah theres nobody down here but us
 Except now
 No were looking around the corner
Slow your roll
 You dont know that
 Six plus
 What is it a d plus anything
 Hail Satan
  Theres so much I can do
 No one gets Luck
 You are not even the presidentelect yet
I need to see more speeches before I know where
my votes going
 I love it when you can hear the DMs
frustration in the retelling of the story
 No
 Yeah maybe we should just leave What do
you think Pack up and go
 Mm
 Im good Yknow
It was only a joke Nott sorry
Terrible timing We should push on
 Really
 Lots of eyeballs

 The two clerics do not go
shouldertoshoulder
 Well you got shitty darkvision Oh but
you got the goggles And who are you with Nott
 Darkvision for Yasha
  feet
 Decent
 I dont know maybe outside of the tunnel
Back at the place where we were
 I will give you advantage
 Helping yeah
 Well as a bit of clarification I think
we werent supposed to use it right
Anything that would activate it and send off
energy I think as long as its in the other
dimension that is her bag its okay right
 Youve got the gun and the clip
The only way theyre going to grab it and
turn it out is if most of us are dead right
 Thats right
 Lets push forward
 Probably And weve got lots of room to
maneuver in these caverns
 You know dire honey badgers got claws and
stuff Maybe a dire sheep
 Yeah anyway
 Itll hit you in the moment I got a
feeling
 Totally
 What are you rolling for
 We press on
 I forget what time we entered into the
tunnel What time of day was it
 We could push on for another hour or two
but we really should
 You fucking feat
 Absolutely
 Ill help
 Succinct
 We are going to rest right I mean might
as well take advantage of such a nice place
 Earthen
 Backs against a wall are always safe
 Five more
 Wow
 This is  what were supposed

 Confirmation Were doing good
 Do we want to take watches Were pretty
safe right
 Lets all try it Everybodys sleeping

 Natural 
 
 
 Oh balls and anus Here you go  No
 
 Oh a river pond
 Yep bigass body of water
Big enough to show up on a map
 Biped signs of life
 Well Jester arent temples better served
by like heavy foot traffic You know
 Well keep an eye on the entrance
and exits
 Ill go to over where we think from
Beaus notes the creature seems to have gone
 Mmhmm
 Nice   No 
 Oh no
  is pretty good considering
I have no initiative bonus
 No
 I dont know Halforcs I dont know
 I could have taken a feat that
wouldve given me but
 What is this thing
 What is that sadistic Japanese
traffic cone
 Oh fucking balls What is this
  What the fuck is that
 Is it
  for Fjord
 Yasha got a 
 I do
 Well I have a short moment of freak out
as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles
 Since the rest of the group doesnt seem
to have noticed them I will charge up two
Eldritch Blasts and send one in each direction
 Point both of them out
 I will do it
That is  to hit
 Not good Can I bonus action Hex
the second one
 Before the other attack
 Yeah
 Thatll at least help a little bit 
 Big trouble
  didnt hit it Ill come up on top of
that platform and take a little bit of cover
behind that Yeah Just right there is good
I dont know what the fuck they do
 Or a tactician
 
 Four
 No evidence to support that
 Stop rolling so many dice
 Maybe we get the fuck out of here
That was a big hit
 Three more
 How about they fought in the
last week and one of them is missing one
 Like sharks in the wild and
theyve got battle damage you know
 Okay
 Thats terrible
 Yeah draw that
 What do you mean reel
These attacks are real
 I dont know what these things are
 Could you use your action
if she hadnt already
 Ill use my  feet and I will come around
that cover and I will run down to the
 That is a lot
 Amazing I will run up and take
two swings with the Summers Dance
falchion against the stunned
 Thats amazing okay
That is a  to hit
 The second one is not as great
That is only a  Misses
 Yeah All right Eight  oh
d for Hex  points of slashing damage
 I am going to use my bonus action
and use Misty Step on the falchion
to bamf back up on the platform
 Yep And that is my turn
 Yasha would like to rage She will
rush the traffic cone from hell that is
attacking Caduceus and Caleb and take two
strikes with her Magicians Judge
 Reckless attacks please
 I love barbarians so much
  times three is  right
Yeah  points of slashing damage
 Oh times two sorry 
Not times three times two 
 Thats it yeah Oh no sorry
rage is three 
 It does
 That hits
 So hitting it doesnt make them
drop the grapple
 I was hoping that would be the case
 Those circles are so great
 Tentacles made of rock as well
 Boom
 Good call
 Thank god he didnt take anybody
with him
 That Cobalt fighting style Doobah
 Yeah straight roll
 Ill run back up and take two
swipes with the Summers Dance falchion
 Yeah me too First one is a 
and the second one is a 
 Just straight
 Nice Ten plus four is  points
of slashing damage with four points
of necrotic in there from the Hex The
second one is eight plus six

 Like a hero I run up behind it and take
inspiration from Beau and I go 
Doobah
 Youre welcome

 Actually Yasha will run up to
Caleb as were running and she will do
Healing Touch because she never does that
shit to Caleb and put what is it
Healing Hands healing seven points
She never wastes an action on that
 Is that what theyre called
 Like octopus
 Oh Lets go back and check that water
 Can I walk up and touch it and
see if any of it moves or is different
 Yeah Ill start doing that
 Ill do the same thing Ill throw
some Eldritch Blast at it
 Ill move my Hex over onto it
  points of Eldritch damage
 One of those hits 
 No sorry  to hit
 Before he fires  points
of damage four necrotic
 I dont know what that is but
I dont think you should use it no more
 Two more Eldritch Blasts
Ooh natural 
 Natural  and a 
  points of Eldritch Blast on the
first one and  points on the second one
Man thats so weird
 No scoot No No
 Yashas pulling rocks
Fjords pulling rocks
 Not fast enough
 Nobody knows what that is
 Are you in the tunnels
 Yeah and there wasnt much of an
ambush we could do anyway
Its one way in one way out Well be fine
 You know if youre going to do those
maybe put some chimes behind them
so you can be like a bell tower
 Is sme one word s apostrophe
me Okay
 She loves
 Im roughly counting so I dont know
 Nott I have to say Ive been feeling
pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously
I want to apologize for making you face your fear
over and over again No Ive been giving you some
shit and as someone who has experienced the
same thing I commend you for your bravery
 Yeah
 Thats cool dont worry about it Yeah
 No but thank you all the same
 Oh fucking balls
 Wow really Now
 Its super dark Lives could be at
jeopardy at any moment and you want to trip
 Yeah
 Why do you do these things
 Oh crap No
 Constitution saving throw
 Is there anything on the ceiling as I
awkwardly stare up at it
 Oh I was kidding but
 
 Yes
 Like on the sides or
 Up in front of us
 Man I hate to interrupt but you know
we have some divergent pathways ahead
 Yeah
 Hey you want to send that cat
of yours about  feet behind us
 It looks like two of those had
stuff pushed into it
That one looks like something came out of it
 That one came into this one though
After the big guy came through
 Caduceus go look up front
Jesus god
 Anything behind us
 Why Why a hammer
 What that we can be under the Ashkeeper
Peaks and these are mining tunnels
 I think were dead under this
mountainpeak right 
Were like 
 Might as well see where this thing goes
We can keep going if we have to
 There could be pigeons on the
mountaintop
 Is there another kind
 Not helping
 Do we have any real positives for
going up I honestly cant think of any
 How far can Frumpkin go
 How about just to that edge then
 Get it off
 He cant hear us
 My two cents
 I think they did a pretty
good job of closing up these tunnels right Made
it so that the average Joe or even someone
ablebodied would be unable to follow them
I think this is probably the last place they
think someone would come from
Above ground pretty sure theyre covered
 Theyre small right Theyre small
tunnels
 Yeah I mean were already dealing with
the twobodywidth tunnel as it is I dont want
to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked
 Send the cat
 I thought the cat went up the
small tunnel
 Yeah lets send him up the
small one Thats what I was thinking
 Ill run up and push myself up against
the wall against where the tunnel is
just in case they decide to come out that way
 Do we hear any movement coming
from the tunnel
 Yasha rolled a six
 Fjord rolled a 
 I reach down and grab the spear
and yank it out of its hands
 What are you 
 No No no
 Oh shit
 Oh shit What

 Bot username
 Same page as you
 Oh good This is my forte these days
 
 Fuck Thats so embarrassing
 We should run We should go
 Just run forward
 World of magic and mystery
 Nice Draconic
 Deity
 Upside down
 How about the food
 We have two gator skins
in the bag of holding
 Yeah
 Are you interested in gator
Its like real tough leather
I mean bet you could use it as some
 I know yeah its so rare I mean maybe
its better we just hold onto the gator
 I dont know I mean I could maybe part
with one for the rest of us
 Well all right I pull out two
gator skins My friends will
have to be able to go on their way
 I mean I hate to Theyre worth
a fortune and boy the protection
that they yield mmm dogie Ah okay
 Yeah
 Wait a path the big one
 Ask them if theyve been all the way to
the end of the
 Have you been all the way to the end of
big mess tunnel
 Why not
 Yeah we ran forward
 Yeah what is in that cage
 Are we going to pass judgment
on this thing Come on
Lets just keep going and turn a blind eye
 I know where youre going with this
This is going to backfire
 Uhhuh
 I dont think thats accurate
 Shit
 Theyre watching us leave
Theyre escorting us out
 Mmhmm
 Mmhmm
 There you go
 Is the dome out
Are we summoning the whole thing
 Im sitting crosslegged
on the floor staring at the dirt
 You son of a bitch You slowplaying
son of a bitch
 That was good
That was some bullshit
 Not playing
 This fucking
 Little scorpion on the end of the stick
 Please hit
 Yeah best place
have to make a constitution saving throw
 Jester you killing them or what
 You dont want to play with that
 Whatd he say
 Sounded like theres something that
shoots centipedes on me
 
 
 That was fucking terrible
I hold it up by the tail
 Oh no
 As fun as that was you know
instead of killing this adorable little guy
maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide
 Stop No hey hey
 I think youll have no trouble finding
your way back How far down this tunnel
have you ventured before Spurt
about  feet
 Oh shit Brave new world
 Oh god this is it The swan song
 Oh my god
 We should keep going
  Its dark down here
Not good not good
 Yes
 Please have some real armor
 Remember that number kids
 points of bludgeoning damage
 I run to the side of the cavern wall and
lean up against it and shrink down
the hammer
 Shh Shh
 Holy fuck
  natural   and Yasha rolled an

 Is that the quickest weve ever
had a player character come in and die
 Yeah were pressed flush
 Thank you two natural s
 Caleb you ever read about
anything like this
 Yeah crazy dark oh you have
 No dark citadels I mean
this is an accident right
This isnt where were trying to go
 Yeah well get back to that
 How far from the opening of
the tunnel that were at off to the left
are both of the fire giants
 Natural 
 Got to love those Critical Role dice
 You chaotic motherfucker How much
shit can I throw on one person
 What is this Where the fuck are we
 I think diplomacy will be
our best tactic Lets use words
 Yeah it worked well before
And the other fire giant
 The second fire giant is on this
side of the molten river of death
 Uhhuh one
 Thats a fire giant I thought
that was the citadel
 Those are shields
 This the worst American Gladiators
course ever

 Hes right next to where we need to go
Its a big problem
 Fire shield Magma shield
 What happens after they attack us
in the bubble
 Yeah I dont know about
the bubble thing
 What if it breaks what about
when it expires
 Nonfighting options
 I can take one
person with me  feet in a single direction
 I could create a false diversion thats a
massive beast in the opposite direction of us
or I could make a real beast
 Oh they both are
 I have a suggestion I can make a
manticore appear run from the cave and leapfly
over the river and carry off in the direction
that is opposite of where we need to go
 It sounds and looks like a real manticore
but if you make contact with it its just an illusion
 So you can go invisible you can go
the entire distance youre fast as balls
 Calebs fast as balls
 I can take one person with me
 With one person
 Whos the odd man out Who doesnt
have a way to get over there real quick
 How long is your speed
 Nott how do you feel about
 Sure okay
 Caleb do you have a plan
 To get across
 Im asking
 Im taking Caleb
 Youre running balls youre invisible
  feet
 It would be pretty close Were going to
send both of them in the opposite direction
 Yeah We dont do any of this until they
fucking move away from where we need to go
Ready
 Sure sounds good I like it
 Heres the order Youre going to
Polymorph Caduceus Youre going to go invisible
and get started Im going to set the diversion
and then we start going
 I dont think so
 You are doing that
 I turn to Yasha and say
 When I give
you the signal you and I are going to run
towards the river of magma and hold on tight
 But Nuggets like in your pocket right
 Three two one
 Get your head start both of you
 Youre not just going to fly across
the room by yourself
 Beau and Nott Im going to give you
 seconds before we start
 Its your call
 Are you going to trip
 All right fine I will use Major Image
and I will cast the image of a manticore
climbing out of the magma river on this side
of the bank roaring at the fire giant
and then leap flying over to the other side
 Visuals and sounds
 Yeah he comes out here roars
and then jumps over
 I think its a  Shit Where the hell is
that on this thing
 Anyone know where that is
 Oh 
 Im not
 If we run out of here are we
How far is his melee ten feet
 Massive
 We break out Yasha and I run
 
 Yasha hates cows
 Nine
 Uhhuh
 I need Yasha
 
 Fjords going to run out and hug to the
right and hes going to head in this direction
Yasha come on
  feet okay Thats it Awesome
Yeah and I will hold Thunder Step
until Yasha is next to me
 It does
 Yeah just popping
 Yeah
 Like a rock or like a rock
 Just wanted to check
 Oh no
  Fjord just explodes
 The second splat on the fucking ground
 Oh fuck That definitely hits
 Okay
 Constitution check or saving throw
  That was going to be a
plan ruiner for the second time
 Bison Buffalo
 
 Jesus
  Bitch slap a cow
 That hits
 They got bigass teeth
 Another constitution saving throw
 Okay all right Come on come on
Natural 
 Next time you specify dairy cow
 Yasha will use  feet of movement to run
past the cow to come into contact with Fjord
 Does the cow get an attack of
opportunity
 I understand
 Fjord summons the falchion and
stabs it into the ground casting
Thunder Step and will go  feet
in the direction of the tunnel
 It does It does d
thunder damage
 I forgot about that
   points
of thunder damage
 Constitution 
 Actually it takes  damage
 Hey All right
 Super invisible right
 Yeah do it
 You maintain
 Just wait just wait Dont do anything yet
 This is vengeance for
the traffic cone guys
 Yeah I dont want to draw
any more attention to the cave
because thats where hes got to go
 Im going to do nothing
Thats my turn
 You going to join me
on the nope train
 But my fake manticore is
still flying around
 Whatever that citadel is
We should go attack the citadel
 Whats your jumping distance
 Negative Nope train
 Because of the level up
 Oh my god
 What is that citadel
  If I could turn back time
find a way
 d
  Ones Ones
 Hes counting
 Youre unconscious
 d What is the matter
with you Perkins Didnt you know
this moment was coming when you made those
rules
 I get that lava is dangerous but fuck
 That was amazing What are you talking
about Were fine
 Kill that fire giant with your duplicity
 Kick him in the shin
 No Caleb can walk his happy ass inside
No Fjord is doing nothing
 Fjords doing nothing
 I thought you put it out Oh yeah I will
run over and pat the fire out
 Yeah You good
 Yasha will put her hand on Fjord
and hit healing hands giving him
 Five feet is not enough
We must keep running
 Must go faster
