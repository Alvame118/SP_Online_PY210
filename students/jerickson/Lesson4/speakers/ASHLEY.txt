 I feel like I didnt need to be in there
anymore You know I dont ugh
 I feel like
 
 Its good to see you guys too
 I have a little bit of a problem with
authority and I didnt want to be caught in a
small and confined space and then that ended up
happening
 Immediately after I ran away They sent
out horses Im not that fast but I did fuck up a
few of the guards By accident 
 Wheres Toya
 Wait so who killed him
 It was him
 Whats happened with Toya
 How is she
 Oh well
 I mean I kind of go on my own but
  Youre very funny
 You could always try to take it
 Yeah
 You do look pretty strong I mean youre
just a little bit bigger than me but I still
think I could probably take you
 What about your sword
 I think its something that kids play I
have a better version of that game We can play it
later
 No Im just going to float around like I
usually do
 I will
 Toya
 What are your plans What do you want to
do
 I mean Ill say it I dont know if you
will but I think that little girl is creepy

things I need do so
 Where are you going again

 I would love a map
 Okay Well go shopping with you
 Oh are you scared of me
 Well I thought you were Nott the Brave
 But you guys were there together Because
you knew each other before
 It just depends where in the south

 You know Im just Ill make my way
wherever we go and maybe Ill not stay with you
the whole time but I dont like you know
 Yeah I dont groups and things
 Uh no
 I like to have my freedom
 No I dont mean it like that I just want
to make my own way sometimes
  Yeah thats right
 What happened to you
 Was this a test of some sort
 Yeah I think Ill join you
 Oh I did actually want to see that map
 I think thats a great idea Seeing me see
a map is something pretty special
 Maybe not all of them
 That is so beautiful
 I also really like what youve done with
the place
 Do you have a deal you know if we got
all of them That seems pretty high Right That
seems pretty high for a healing potion
 Three
 How do we know if its good quality
though Can I give it a sample
 Well you might as well make another one
Im not going to let my friend experience it alone
 You dont want to go to Zadash is that
right
 Yasha
SAM Its like Ash with an ay
 Not really but close enough
 Oh
 Im not going to kill you
 All right well
 That was very nice of you thank you
 I take out a book that I have and in
between some of the pages is a fourleaf clover
Ill take the flowers and Ill put them in between
the other pages and Ill put it away
 I think I need to stay here just a little
bit longer But I will meet you guys there at some point
 I just dont think I can leave here until
Im told I can
 No I just
 I have things that I need to do
 I have reasons I can stay I just need to
converse with somebody to see where my next step leads
 No yes no Its not him
 No
 When you get to Zadash maybe send me a
note or maybe Ill be there I just have to do a
couple things
 Okay That sounds like a plan
 Hopefully soon I never know Ill try
 I dont think any of them are watching
 Oh hi
 Im here A little sleepy but Im here
Oh Well if it isnt my old friends
 You know Ive been tracking you guys for
quite some time and I knew you were here but I
just figured I might want to get a bath first and
get a rub down Treat myself
 I enjoy sometimes the finer things of
life
 I know Im sorry I had some things to
do
 I found him in the woods In a Bag of
Holding
 You guys are not very discreet Youre
pretty easy to follow
 Uh yeah
 Okay I came for the aftermath of it but
I didnt see Or I would have jumped in and
helped of course
 Oh I do remember you quite well
 I said I was going to meet you here in
Zadash
 I did I have things that I occasionally
tend to and I did
 Ish
 Its not that mysterious I just have
things that I have to do sometimes
 Trouble
 You made  gold in three days
 Oh How nice What do they look like
these buttons
 Your other clothing
 I did hear that youve been calling
yourselves something I hear a name floating
around that youre calling yourselves the Mighty
Nein
 Three and a half
 In a handful of days
 Its neither here nor there but just for
clarification is it Nine as the number nine
 Okay
 You look different
 No I actually dont know much about
spells and things
 Nice
 Have you been in the water at all
 Do you not like going into the water
 Nott do you know how to swim
 We could hold you

Sea

Thats pretty spectacular that thats your mother
 How do you feel now Are you still
scared
 Do you want to stand at the side then and
hold the side
 Well I know I have to be careful about
some certain things I think Ill be fine
 No
 Im not in trouble for anything I think
if anything it would be because of the god Ive
chosen to follow
 Its the Stormlord I dont know if you
know of him
 Yes hes pulled me out of what literally
felt like the depths of hell so I owe him my
life I will continue to serve him and do as he
asks whenever he asks
 No
 No
 I was cold
 I recall when you asked for it it was a
very cold day
 I got it
 You pay extra to keep your weapons
 He called you a baby a lot
 Im going to wait until everyone gets
out
 Yeah I just want to make sure that I get
my full times worth
 I mean I dont care to show anything
 I feel like this is a pool of honesty I
just wanted to see everybody else naked first
 Okay Im getting out
 Oh thank you Jester I get
uncomfortable I dont hug her back but I gently
give her one pat

human touch
 Um Barry

 I thought we took a Hey I am not a
person to judge I know I dont look Its fine

 The trick is to not expect anything in
life
 Then youll never be disappointed you

 He shows up to you as a man Or how does
that work
 Okay
 I mean I certainly dont see him in the
flesh so no
 Yes of course

 Thats a good idea actually Thats a
good idea
 Should we get you a rag as well Just to
have on hand like a hanky So you dont have to do
a full bath you could just do a quick
 Im definitely not bothered
 If youre renting a room there maybe they
have to let us in
 I have a tinder box too I have a torch

do me any good
 Oh
 Should I take up the rear
 
 What if we 
 Is it close enough to us
 Are we able to get to this lump
 Or do we have to go through some of the
web
 Maybe we can look at it up closer

 I think if they start moving this things
going to
 But then well get eyes on it

 Nein

 Thank you very much
 What were you fighting
 The Kryn dynasty they are from northern
Xhorhas
 I am from
 Xhorhas
 Not very long About lets see maybe
eight months or something
 I travel I left  I chose not
to live there anymore
 I just you know its not a great place
to live Its awful Its marsh and its not a
comfortable place to live
 Seven Because I have a negative
 Yes I most definitely am I can assure
you I dont stand for anything bad from the
Xhorhas and I am here to help
 Okay
 Yes thats me
 Great Same here because this was great
conversation
 Ah you know
 But to be clear do you know what youre
fighting
 Just if youre fighting I just wanted to
know if you were fighting the Kryn
 I wish you the best of luck
 Okay
 Where did he say we could meet up
 Rexxentrum
 I figured its like one of those things
that if youre going to get caught you might as
well tell the truth because its easier to
remember I dont know I panicked
 I dont think so Did I say anything that
was bad
 Oh I said both of those things
 Either that or they think that Im a
Xhorhasian assassin and I am not
 Its the Kryn dynasty
 No
 Well I dont know if that is any of your
business at this time
 Im not on any side but I do think what
we are fighting is something very terrible
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah I mean we heard about them in the
north and theyre mostly dark elves that settled
in a massive ruin that was completely forbidden
for us to travel to
 Yeah The ones that went there They do
keep their skies dark Its some kind of dark
magic that we dont know of that keeps the sun
away Theyve enslaved men and beasts and demons
under their banner
 Ive never been there because its hard to
get there and its not someplace I would want to
go alone
 Ive heard stories but never anybody
personally
 Ive always been curious Just to see with
my own eyes but theyve done so many bad things
that I would want to fight them
 I dont know
 You charge for these services
 Oh
 I dont agree I feel like you would be
very good at it
 Okay Im maybe showing a little bit of pink
on my cheeks
 Caleb what did you say Guten
 Yeah I have my feet linked so I can
monkey piggyback ride
 Four gold for two rooms
 What kind of companionship do you have
here available
 I dont know just one that I maybe
lots
 Lets make one for adults
 But you dont need to give us money
 It looks like she loves you very much
too
 Plus  gold is a lot of money Thats
more than I pretty much have right now
 Jester its your money
 And otherwise
 A rat
 Well we can get them here and then save
those for another
 Well yeah I am pretty hungry
 You dont like to cook yours
 Nott thats crazy I mean Ill try it
but I feel like its much Do you want me to have
them cook it Have you ever had it cooked
 With a little salt little pepper
 No
 What do they have
 Are you sure you wont take it
 Do you promise me
 Okay
 We were going to play some Truth or Dare
 Fjord and Jester made out
 Wait I roll too I roll too because I
was part of the lie
 I rolled a four
 May I take a look at that map Jester
 Thats a good idea
 That was crazy
 I wonder if theres any way to find out
somehow what it is before accepting
 What What do you mean you get control of
your fate
 Can you go back and
 Do you want to try it
 Im going in
 Okay
 Do you feel like you have control over
your fate
 Yeah we should explore this idea but
maybe
 Oh what does it do
 No
 Well come back for another day
  gold is a lot of money
 Yeah
 Ill help you
 Okay Thats something
 Should we say our goodbyes to Orentha
 What does the contract entail
 How long are we in contract with you Just
for this or
 Thats an option
 Thats true
 d
 Nice 
 Plus two
 Thats right
 No thats a big deal
 You guys are fucking each other up
 I am along for the ride
 I mean Im up for all of it you know
Whatever you guys decide
 May I see the map just to make sure

south anyway
 Ill go with you
 The Wand of Smiles
 Should we just get that started and well
go
 I dont need to Id feel weird
 Well yeah Ill ride a horse
 Ill take a horse as well because you
guys are all in the cart yeah
 
 I give him a pet But is it real I dont
understand because sometimes it just poofs you know
 I am not trying to make you upset or
anything just sometimes it goes away then it
comes back Im confused
 Can I touch him
 Hes making a very strange noise right
now
 
 No I have heard of cats but Frumpkin
is one of the first
 Thats true we have lots of rats We have
many creatures

 This is as far as Ive ever been you
know
 Here Ive only been to Xhorhas and
Zadash
 I did grow up in Xhorhas I did grow up
there but I left there I think it was about
 I think it was about eight months ago
yeah from what I can remember All of this is
still very new you know I like this stuff grass
and things you know
 I think so its a much softer ground to
sit on you know Instead of a marshy sandy
 Yeah
 I dont know if I had a favorite part
 I mean its all I know but its probably
not the best place to grow up now that Im seeing
everything else you know I think sometimes I
wish maybe it was a little different
 Yes I think I will always have that
 Well
 I dont know if youre going to be that
impressed by it but maybe youll like it
 Yeah Well I wonder I mean I wonder if
anyone else I think is our time up or
 But yeah you dont see it and you dont
get hungry
 Well that I understand
 Well be right back
 Okay Im going to get off my horse
  Stop it

 Yes fucking way
 Im just laying there and Im holding
 I dont know
 I dont know Am I still holding it
 Did you see that thing
 You didnt see any creature or anything
 I was fighting something It was a
creature
 It was winged and it had red eyes It
looked like it was a ball of lightning
 I dont know I was standing in front of
the ship and I had a vision of home Then I woke
up and then the lightning struck When it came
down it was the creature
 I guess if you didnt even see it I
grabbed something out of it I guess it was its
heart Now its gone
 Okay Well maybe I need to think on this
a little bit more
 Yeah
 Im okay
 Im going to go talk to Caduceus
 Hey Caduceus
 Hey
 Yes
 Sorry Burning hair is not a good smell
 Well I was oh that wouldve been
nice
 Okay I was at the bow of the boat and I
was trying to connect with the Stormlord I dont
know I ended up getting a vision
 I think I did
 Im pretty fried I fought something
though It was lightning that came down and then
turned into a creature
 Yes
 Its here
 I think I need to keep trying to find him
I guess hes found me
 Thats what I was going to ask you Im
going to go back upstairs
 I go back upstairs
 I go back upstairs
 Mmhmm
 I just want to sit outside still
 I guess so Im just trying to make sense
of all this still I feel like I had some
visions of home that made me very happy and sad at
the same time but it must all mean something
 Um
 Yeah I had to leave
 I did something that I did something
that wasnt the right thing to do according to my tribe
 In my tribe we have a matriarch of the
tribe the Champion and her name is the Skyspear
 And when you become a part of the tribe
you take a blood oath and you get a name and I
was given the name Orphan Maker When you become a
part of the tribe as time goes on you are given
a mate But I fell in love with someone else that
was not chosen for me and we got married privately
 I did But they found out and the
punishment for that is death and they killed her
and I ran away so I I am a coward I guess
 Thank you Jester In our tribe when you
get married its for life Even if shes gone
shell always be mine
 Her name was Zuala
 Yeah I left and Im sure they were coming
after me and I got into the wastes of Xhorhas and
something happened Theres time that I cannot
account for I was out there for months by myself
and it seems like I woke up months later and I
looked different and I felt different I woke up
at an altar of the Stormlord and he saved me For
what yet I dont know but hopefully I can be a
better champion for him and fulfill whatever
purpose he has for me
 I dont know if my heart could ever be
healed but Im okay with that I feel like if it
were put back together then that means Zuala
would be gone I know one day I want to go back
there I dont know where she was buried but I
have so many flowers to bring to her I dont know
what all this means but I sometimes I dont
know I dont know

 I feel like sometimes I get nervous to get
close to people because I feel like I lose them
And then Molly
 I feel like Im either very unlucky or
cursed and I dont believe in luck
 Thats true
 Yeah I think so I think so This is very
good tea
 Whats in here
 Like its people
 Im fine with it
 Well maybe this is best kept to us
 I mean Im fine with saying it but its
a long story and
 Of course
 I think so I feel like Im trying to
learn that from you Jester
 Yeah you say whats on your mind
 Its good
 Im going to try to start doing that
 To surviving
 To minty families
 Balleater
