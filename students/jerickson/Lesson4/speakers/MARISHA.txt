sensitive subject
 Adopted sister

with the investigation In fact you can see the
injury the beast left on my ribs so if you want
to test it for any type of specimen samples feel
free Its very painful but Im willing to do it
for the cause
 No Its a separate issue There was two
things going on There was like the big angry
toad beast and he got a swipe at me And then
there were people who were getting attacked

 Nope

hint whats going on
 
 Yeah if anything we should be looking
at this guy Why are we putting our neck out for
you
 Can I insight check him
 Her Sam Natural 
 Front butt You just saw that too

 You guys peaced out pretty quickly
 Just curious why you have a mask
 Yeah Bringing it back
 My mother always said nothing in life is
free
 None of this absolves the dodgy goblin
who slinked past that first question Where are
you from What are you traveling from Why the
mask
 Sure you are
 It has nothing to do with that People
who move from place to place frequently tend to
have other stories as to why theyre doing it
 Well youre going back to the goblin
thing Im more curious about the travel thing
 I immediately check my pockets after that
to see is Nott has lifted anything Is everything
still there all my coin
 Not great Not great at all Six
 Wait that was a  Right That was the
dice I rolled 
 Okay
 Wait Im sorry I think I need
clarification If sticks mean things like valuable
canes what do rocks mean to you
 Is it the joy of taking the things or do
you just like gifts
 Do I notice anything shifty about that
while we were looking at his hands
 
 You have questions for me
 Yeah I am
 My parents were in the winery business
The wine making business And halflings really
like wine
 Thats true
 Some halflings just deal in wine a lot
and a lot did in the town that Im from and then
my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and
all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling
I was around it a lot
 Its a bit aways Its Kamordah
 Its a small farming town its no big
deal Its whatever
 Nope just a wandering traveler just like
the rest of yall
 Yeah circus Woo circus coming to
town
 Just dont break anything
 Aw buddy
 Ive seen you have a few tricks up your
sleeve You seem like youre not totally magic inept
 Have you had your abilities your whole
life like a kid
 Something happen
 We got a good  hours on the rest of
you
 Nope
 Can I request a display I think I have a
broken rib It might be getting more purple
 Ill sleep it off its fine
 Does it hurt
 Dont poke at me with a fork
 No you dont
 My bruise is in the shape of a dick
 That would be fun
 All right Ill sleep it off
 Im in Jesters room still I think
Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll
 You hit a button
 He just throws the iPad
 As I wake up I sit up and I go
 Jester
 Were you laughing to yourself last night
I just kept hearing giggling It was obnoxious
 Uhhuh I just get ready
 Yeah
 I take my robes and I flip them inside
out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little
bit and take my hair down and I steal
a scarf off of Jesters stuff and I do a
bandana around my head
 What are you guys doing You guys
leaving Are you guys fucking leaving Youre not
leaving without me are you
 Youre skipping town
 I could skip town with you though Do
you want to skip town
 I guess I go down and have breakfast as
well
 Would you do my makeup for me
 Are you
 Lets do that
 I mean look at him No offense or
anything
 And youre so concerned with your goblin
friend I mean hes in the same boat as the
tieflings
 I said your goblin friend
 Whatever
 Im working on it
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
LAURA Yeah and a mustache And a hat
 Love it
  I think I can do that
 Im going to go a step further and tape
down my boobs bandage them down all the way you
know wrap them Stuff my crotch a little bit
 Do I have some five oclock shadow
 Mr Woolly
 Wait Fjord how do you sound Say words
youre manly
got nuts

 Is that your human face
 Its so hard
 So anxietyinducing
 Are we going out in pairs Like you said
 Are we going out in pairs
 Yeah
 
 Its fine dont worry about it
 I mean you mentioned no sick people If
he was sick sometimes that word gets around
 He was helping
 I punched a snake to death
 Oh it was a giant water snake then the
little girls were complaining about more and more
instances of these snakes coming out of the lake
 Yeah
 The Lochward is that what were talking
about
 Sure
 You know we should drink to old stories
of Brinjay
 Brinjay
 Is there anyone who did That wasnt
hypothetical
 Whats the book
 A romance novel
 Shithead
 We learned a few things actually Hes a
prime target Perfect victim perfect candidate
No one really paid attention to him he was old
he had no family his sons gone
 Awfully convenient Still awfully
convenient that your little circus doesnt allow
the elderly which you never fully explained and
he happened to be one of the oldest people in that
circus Where did that rule come from
The sick makes sense I asked you that
before but why elderly
 Do you know who implemented that rule
 Still a good candidate
 Or if you were trying to frame someone
Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this
town who dont like tieflings and other strange
lots Jester you actually said one of the
smartest things of the night which is you did
yeah Which is guards really weird
 Yeah
 The Crownsguards As you were saying the
Ustaloch
 They seem to be the one connecting
throughline Also whats her name Norda
Mentioned that she didnt want to let you lot in
but made an exception I dont know if I wanted
to do something and if I already knew a bunch of
people were upset and angry at a circus and
strange people coming in its easy framing in my
opinion
 That or if youre up to no good and you
dont want to get caught blame it on the easy
frame The weirdos who just rolled into town
 I dont know it might not be the
guards There might be another throughline
that were missing
 Ooh thats a good idea yeah Maybe when
they question us
 I like that
 Aw
 So the Ustaloch is the docks Its what
they called the ward or its the lake
 What does usta mean What does usta
come from
 You speak Zemnian
 All right
 Agreed
 I love how we just went through every
rain song in about  seconds
 Oh shit
 Hey Jester Do you happen to remember
the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from
the snake
 Yeah
 Yeah because I didnt write it down
 Damn it
 Thats true
 We could go by He seems to like us
 Thats the snake I punched
 Well no They helped me Im not an
egomaniac They fucking helped me
 Give credit to the whole damn group move
on
 Thanks for the damn compliment
 Sorry for dropping in
 Yeah its me I pull the hat off and
pull my hair up Its Beauregard We killed your
snake
 Oh no Dont worry about it What was
your name friend
 Rinaldo Thats what it was I knew it
was an R Okay Rinaldo
 You mentioned the circus coming to town
as weird Why
 Hows your little girl doing Sorry I
cover my beard
 Sorry
 I have a fang too right
 Im starting to think that following
Enons story isnt necessarily going to lead us
here He seems like a random victim
 Are we just going from person to person
in town telling them to come find us
 Yeah maybe we should get back
 So kids dont know anything about this
old people dont know anything about this
 But pure of heart Still going back to
the guards thing Back to the tavern lets go
 Yeah how much time does she have
 Maybe super stealthily back
 Yeah thats a good idea
 Fjords distracting
 Hes on Calebs back
 Yeah he updates overnight as long as
hes plugged in right
 Type in your passcode if you agree to the
terms
 Did you say that because you wanted to
tell me something
 I like that Were giving them
authority Got the upper hand Okay
 Do we invite them in or are we going
to You open the door Im going to sit
unassuming on the bed
 Oh
 Oh yeah hi
 Bullshit Jury duty shit Goddamn it
 Seven dollars a day What is this shit
 You guys should start a band Like a boy
band or something
 I thought you enjoyed games
 Sure
 Okay
 Thats not true I still say that some of
the best information that you can get can be in
the information that you dont find
 Im just saying Sometimes the lack of
information can be a process of elimination
 Its super broad
 Im trying to be fucking silver lining
so I dont feel like a piece of shit for waste a
day and you guys are shitting on that but its
fine
 See No one knew anything about him That
means prime candidate someones little
experiment Little Frankenstein Im telling you
 Who are you talking to
 About  hours longer than you have
 Ooh thats a good idea
 You guys notice that its weird that no
ones actually really talking about this This is
a small town I come from a small town Small town
people gossip
 Someone is talking about this we just
 Mmhmm I like that
 Oh is he like an asshole cat
 Yeah we did
 Natural Remedies What was the other one
Jackalwere
 Thats true How do people send messages
in this town Have we figured that out
 Before we leave
is there a window in
the hall Or are there only windows in our bedrooms
 Okay thats fine On our side of the
room
 On our side of the door Im going to
take out my healers kit Do I have any bandages
or medical tape or anything like that
 Im going to tie a bandage ever so
lightly around one side of the handle onto
something on to the other side of the door If
theres something like a lamp or some kind of pipe
or something I can tie it to
 Correct
 Okay yeah Ill take some string and
just some twine and
 Yeah
 Well I figured were all in the same
room at this point
 Im trying to make sure that if someone
tries to come in our room well know if they come in
 What can you do
 Thats better Lets do that
 Well I was going to say in the door but
if theres maybe a place in the hall
 
 Lets not spread out too far though
 Perception
 
 To the left
 Three in the morning
 I turn to Caleb Any tingling from your
alarm system
 Thats a good point
 Is she under arrest We dont know
 Maybe we should go back to the circus
Scene of the crime That whole thing
 Im all right
 Or if you see something How far are we
from the inn
 A little tagger
 Is no one staying behind or
 Oh not great Nine
 Are we in like an alleyway or in the
street
 All of us
 Oh man
 Its real cold out
 You fixed them a bit
 Yay
 What is that Do you guys have like a
nightlight
 Oh sure

 Okay yeah
 Something good something good

 Im sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed
and he doesnt know why
 Not that one I dont feel good about it
Oh not bad 
 The cart

 Thats pretty close to a lake
 Its the lake its common
 I had Mona and Lena but maybe its
Lolie
 Was there anyone new here recently that
you havent worked with a lot
 What about Mona and Yuli
 Why are they bitter
  What happened to them
 No Im trying to hear and whisper at the
same time
 Matt Cone of Whisper
 What did they say Why do they think
that Why is the world shitty
 Yeah Listen The world has its own brand
of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at
it right So what is their brand of shitty
 Where are they
 Molly why did you laugh when I asked
about the sisters
  Not great
 Right okay
 Can I insight check the sisters What are
they doing right now
 Theyre not saying anything though
 Do they look nervous or are they just
being shifty
 Yeah
 
 Toad guy
 I would like to talk with the sisters
while that is going on
 I go and sit down next to them putting
my knees up too This whole thing is really
messed up right
 Yeah Man Like why would we do anything
like that I feel like were all being needlessly
persecuted
 Oh sorry Im Beau The other Bo but I
helped fight the zombies the other night Im
under house arrest Were under the same
situation just separately Not really I dont
want to compare myself to you because that would
be rude
 Hes such a dick Why is he such a dick
 Oh sorry hes been talking shit about
you this whole time I dont know I just
 Its okay 
 What am I trying to do Im trying to
figure out whos behind all this so that we can
keep moving on with our lives
 Your guys performance was amazing by
the way
 I loved it
 No
 So wait its probably Gustav What makes
you say that
 Oh Wow You have interesting
perspectives Hey weird question how do you guys

 You feel the same way Knot sisters Feel
like this is karma on Gustav
 Shut up
 Shut up
 Insight check on the Knot sisters
 What
 Natural 

 Give me that sweet whisper
 Just a guard One of the guards
 What the fuck
 I run up to the guard and check his
pulse Is he still alive or is he paralyzed
 Yeah but get under the tent We can get
the drop
 Exactly we cant get framed
 And did it look like the same figure
 Towards Ustaloch Its the fucking lake

 See heres my thing Does anyone else
notice that the zombie transformations seem like a
serpent shedding its skin Because they always
slough off their skin
 Wait what
 Oh natural 
 
 I turn to Jester and Molly Fucking we
probably shouldnt kill crownsguard even if its
a zombie Should we go after the toad
 I dont want to be a guard killer All
right fine
 Can I peek out and see the
guardzombies
 Can I crawl out from under the tent and
clear the gap with them and get up to them
 Oh man I dont know what to do
 After Jester trying to help me can I
close the gap to this guy
 Its cool man
 Is that fire still going
 Okay With my initial attack as I run up
can I take my staff and try and take them out at
the knees Just a sweep
 Yeah thats what Im going for
 Thats not great Nine
 Shit
 I look at him and I say you fucking
broke my stick Im going to do an elbow to the
face and then another punch with the staff still
in my hand and do Flurry of Blows
 Right I know Im doing an elbow and a
punch Im just holding my staff
 Two attacks right

crack it over his head
 Okay can I step over the dead guy
Sorry excuse me
 Goddamn it fuck balls and shit 
 Yeah Fuck yeah
 Youre so weirded out about it  points

still trying to figure this out
 Right Learning these combat abilities
Im going to do a big roundhouse kick to his
head
 Thats good thats a 
 Thats an unarmed strike Okay eight
points
 Its a two plus No wait Im sorry
six points I was looking at the wrong thing

Christ
 You have a six pack of donuts but you
dont have a healers kit in there And youre the
cleric Im confused
 Well congratulations youre the cleric
now
 Ill give it to her Here its a gift
Congratulationsonyoubeinginanew group gift
 I immediately drop down and start
searching the guard
 We should hide the evidence
 I dont know
 Was there nothing useful on the guard
 How well did the fire burn the other
body Did it do pretty well or
 I thought he was with you
 Oh my god you are so speaking my
language
 I grab the other body and start dragging
it or at least its torso
 Wait you were shooting shit out of your
hands
 Oh
 I start hooking up the horses
 Yeah one is going to hook up to the
wagon and Ill which wagon do we want to take
 Yeah
 Okay
 We better get  from Ford for that
one We better fucking get that
 Molly I appreciate you trying to rally
the horses right now but I really think you
should rest
 I take the reins
 Ornna is there anything else that you
can think of that could possibly help us Like why
this toad decided to freak out right now Anything
that comes to mind before we go chase after your
mess
 Oh god
 Maybe we can at least find him stake him
out and then well rest
 Cats love toads
 We ran into those guards that were
patrolling the lake
 Hang on hang on I want to look around
Do I see any guards
 Big dice dont fail Natural 
 Like an island
 Its far away on the horizon the little
bump
 Theres two figures on a boat about a
hundred yards out
 I dont know Its hard to say Do they
seem distracted Can I make anything else out
 Maybe we can dump them backtrack with
the cart and drop the cart back off
 Im going to help Jester try and clear
the tracks while she positions bodies
  Eight
 If we try and cover the wagon tracks as
much as we can then follow the embankment and try
and ride the horses and the cart along the water
itll hide our tracks as we move northward
 Okay
 You understand
 Towards us
 I think theyre fishermen Lets keep
moving
 North
 Do these silhouettes look proportionate
to each other
 Which way did the fisherman go
 I think we should keep heading away from
the city right

 You bring your own narrative
 Did Toya and Kylre come together with
their act

 Thats what they told you
 You guys are super easy to lie to no
offense or anything They lied to them which means
 You never noticed Toya acting weird You
were never like Oh this is a strange

quirky weird and Oh I think this persons life
force is being siphoned away from them weird

 Is that with my regular attack
 Eight damage
 Yeah who was allowed to run
 Dope
 Hes going to turn into powder
 Hearing you say that Im going to be like
I guess were race you Im going to take off
running after Nott
  feet speed

 That would just get me Ill save it for
right now But I can see Nott and I can see the
guy and I can see the cart
 That was a double move
 All right
 Ten
 Are you down
 I grab Fjord and I say just wait Wait
Let them go
 I want to watch them as far as I can to
try and pinpoint a direction that theyre heading in
 Not great 
 Ah shit the town you guys And Im going to
go back and start trying to put out the fires
 Were like
 Oh no put out this fire
 I totally remember kicking this guys
ass
 Watchmaster
 Has there been something else going on
that you can think of that might have cut off
their food supply
 Bladegarden
 Especially if theyre as desperate as you
say they are
 Have you heard local farmers complaining
about them stealing livestock Missing livestock
 Oh WC
 Its a good name
 Dope
 Im fine with that
 In the meantime you wouldnt have
anything that might help us and our little
expedition would you Healing potion might be
nice if you got one hiding away somewhere in a
closet forgotten
 Fair
 We all have an extra  gold yeah
 Oh there it is I found it
 You should try sleeping on the floor
Its actually really good support
 Sure
 Oh my god you killed your whole family
 Oh okay Never mind keep going Im
sorry
 Wheres home Where is this place that
you stole
 Thats what hes been doing this whole
time
 Isnt that what youre doing to yourself
on a daily basis
 Have you tried any other bloodlines
 Ill save that for another day
 Howd you sleep aside from the crappy
bed
 Yeah I mean its not a bad gig
 I guess we should greet the town
 Yeah Maybe we could just stand in the
middle of town and go Bryce until they show up
 Okay I have a question about this Broad
Barn thing Is Broad Barn the name of an
establishment or is Broad Barn a very broad
barn
 Its a very big barn
 What if its a tavern I dont know I
got confused in his delivery
 All right yeah
 What does the town look like when we step
out front How bad is it
 Was I in the butchers Because that
would be some real horrorlevel shit
 Thats kind of awesome
 Question answered Im sorry Im
standing by Fjord Question answered
 While they were having that conversation
Im hanging back with Fjord if youre cool with that
 Question
 If you were a crazy ravenous
dog humanoid person thing what would make you
really hungry all of a sudden I didnt phrase
that question very well
 Yeah It seems like theyre into meat
Kind of anything
 Also theyre really hungry more so
now
 I dont know Why more so now
 But what if they are still hungry
 You know who else was really hungry out
of fucking nowhere
 Big angry toad man Devil toad guy I
feel like I should get better names for all these things
 I dont know I mean it might be a
coincidence
 Well considering some of them were
undead
 There was that whole zombie gnoll thing
 Yeah How could you forget that
 I legitimately didnt understand what you
said
 Are you okay
 I was just striking conversation
 Okay lets go to the Barn Broad
 I was going along with you
 I turn to Jester and I go look
inviting Look heroic
 Bryce some of these gnolls were undead
or raised from the dead Do you have any inkling
as to why or have you seen that problem around
here before
  Bryce
 Sorry a lot on my mind Speaking of the
aurochs I asked you yesterday if youd heard if any of the
farmers had had their cattle hit You heard that
yet
 Its fine Well ask on our way out Its
good
 I know I feel like I learned something
 An insecticide generally refers to
insects And were talking gnolls
 Youre going to have to use a lot
 Is it a good pickle though
 Guys lets go kill gnolls
 Nom nom nom
 Yeah so good
 No you take it for her please
 What did you say Molly
 Well the butcher got severely cleaned
out
 If we can try and figure out a way to
set up our operation on the edge of the forest so
that were not in the middle of a field in the
open
 Hills are bad to fight in unless youre
on top of the hill Thats good
 Go ahead
 Actually thats not a bad idea at all
Maybe we could have like a survivor round up team
and a defense team
 We can always go back out and get more
ears whenever we damn feel like it
 Lets go
 Oh good I see you brought us your best
Reggie Thanks man
 I saw them take off into the forest I
tracked a little bit right between those trees I
dont know we can start there
 Ill be on the lookout for cart tracks
 Its not my strongest but its okay
  No wait I rolled a natural  so
 I thought it was a  I apologize
 Wait are there nearby towns Are there
other nearby villages
 Oh we only saw one
 Okay can I get like an odd estimate of
maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with
based on the amount of tracks
 I turn to the rest of the group and I go

Good news were real stupid if we thought we
couldnt track them because theres a fuckton of
them Thatll be easy Bad news is oh god
theres a fuckton of them Thats it
 Or is it just open fucking hills
 How rough and how open is our situation
right now Are we in the middle of an open field
 Remember how I was like this is the
worst situation to be in
 I feel like this might be the worst
situation to be in
 Survival
 Perception Oh no Did you see that
 One
 God
 What if I gave Jester a ride on my
shoulders While we walked
 In the cart and Im holding you Itd be
kind of cool
 Okay Like a saving throw or just a
check
 Thats okay Its a 
  Yeah you are
 Oh god 
 Jester Im going to put you down
 Yeah I help Jester hide the cart
 Seems a waste
 Were not in any tree line or anything
 Lets flank Around
 Do we need to have some sort of awesome
whistle or something To communicate with each other
 Oh what was that thing you did in the
circus That was cool

 Yeah I imagine that the ends are going
to be where you need the most strength right
 Great
 
 Do you think theyre centurions
 If they see us Ill bet theyre the alert
system
 But we have to kill them all at once
 Yeah
 You want to try and make a distraction
and bring them closer To us Then we can jump out
of the grass Do the old jump out of the
grass
 Oh buddy
 
 Im going to take the blunt end of the
staff and go right for it as it skids by Im
going to take right in its neck Ooh not great
Ten
 I didnt get my bonus attack on that guy
Can I get my bonus attack
 Okay I want to try and bring my heel
down on top of it as it tries to scooch away
Fucking did you see that
 Nine
 Nine
 You know I had a long day yesterday
okay
 Just was faster than I thought
 Do you mean the hyenas
 Oh mining I misunderstood that too
 Ill take the opposite side that hes
doing
 A ghillie net
 Thats what I was going to say is it
heavy How big is this thing Can we fold it up
and stuff it in a bag
 Oh thats big
 We can grab it on our way back and throw
it on the cart
 Canary in a gnoll mine

 We have to do it its too perfect
 Sorry
 That was going to be my question
 And dies
 Thats right yeah
 Like a walkie talkie
 Ill punch you in the face
 Whats going on
 Its so dark
 It fits in there
 Oh are there any close to me
 Okay Ill close the gap and come at it
with a big double swing from my staff
 Finally a decent roll 
 Six plus four Thats ten points of
damage
 I shake it off my staff a little bit
 Its effective
 Ill look around Are there any other
entrances
 That was me Me and Caleb
 Oh sorry For the bags yeah

lantern
 Oh I can close it on and off right
Like one of those things
 All right guys left tunnel or right
tunnel
 I kind of like her when shes like this
Its good
 Yeah little drafts anything like that
 This sucks
 
 Oh that was well done
 Fuck
 Im afraid if we keep waiting more will
just show up
 Well maybe we can draw a few over to us
and take them out on our terms
 If we can make some sort of distraction
to get their attention and if we can put or
heavy hitters our people up front we can try and
hold them in this mouth ranged people in the back
 You see more are going to keep coming
 Normally miners build coal mines with
connecting shafts and double exits in case one
side collapses You always want another way out
We just dont know where theyve put everybody
Were here looking for villagers remember
 Hey Matt DM question If we were to try
and back out of here and draw them towards us
what would that be Just a tunnel
 Yeah thats what I heard
 Its only a death funnel if were the
ones dying right If theyre dying thats good
for us
 Surprise round get as many range and AoE
spells off as we can
 Lets all agree that if this goes bad we
run
 Oh God
 Can I get more into a place with Beau In
this crux mirroring Nott Stealth check Natural 
 Threepoint landing

 Nope
 Okay Im going to do something weird
and I hope it works and doesnt fuck the rest of

I reach in my bag and grab out in my little
pouch grab out a handful out of my  ball
bearings

bearings go  across this way

advantage Can I consider it a twohanded attack
 Oh my god Why
 
 For flavor my second attack isnt really
an attack Im in so much pain I go  and I

 Natural 
 Every time I try to show off it never
works Thats what Im learning Okay three
doubled to six plus four So ten
 I dont care too much I just roll over
and go fetal for a minute
 Come on Nott Bring it home
 Its almost something like a Jacobs
Ladder moment the end of his life is being
stretched out
 Can I since Im in that general
vicinity go  or so feet into this hole and
listen and see if I hear anything
 
 I bend down
 I turn around and come back to the rest
 I think theres something bigger at play
here Whatever is driving these gnolls I think is
deeper in Can I look around and see if I can find
anything like any papers anything from that
humanoid that might be intelligible
 Okay  total
 Can I try and figure out what this is if
I recognize this symbol in any way
 Yeenogru

 While he does that can we no we cant
take a short rest Its not enough time
 Nope Ignore what I said

what might be deeper and really big

 I just punch him in the shoulder really
hard
 I pull out the oven mitt

hang onto it
 It doesnt matter if I know how to use
arcane artifacts Stuff that hurts people could
still be beneficial to our cause because other
people want to hurt us
 Yeah why dont you see if Fjord wants
it
 I wonder if it works on animals
 Back to the glove thing though
 Exactly
 Its not fair for you to put your issues
onto literal inanimate objects
 No I cant use arcane shit But he can
 Give him the damn paper

are any types of street marking for the sewers
 Natural   I believe 
 So one two three type of a thing What
about the arrow to the left
 This arrow splits into three arrows and
then and its a penis
 Right yeah Also theres got to be an A

more options this way or down deeper
 I mean it is a sewer system
 Or it could just be the main drainage out
of the city
 All right
 I wrote down blockage webbing and
nest
 How big are those slide marks Yasha
 Four inches
 There are people eating 
at home right now
 The water seems to be moving towards the
direction were going

with us being there super angry
 Wife Illiana into it

 I consider being curious a pretty high
skill set but since youre asking beyond that
Im pretty good with this here bo Pretty good
fighter Named Beau Its a little redundant to
be totally honest
 Its kind of obnoxious
 Sometimes it irritates me
 Yeah
 Cant pick them

 Indifference is a pretty strong
sentiment
 What makes you think that now is the
right time for all of this
  Oh god stubbed my toe
 Thanks I was trying to not show my
emotions on my face
 Yeah thank you Im trying to get better
at it Yeah
 What do you think
 In my experience it doesnt matter if he
thinks hes fucking with the Empire or not The
Empire is going to look at it as fucking with
them and that never ends well
 Last thing we want to do is take the fall
for these assholes
 And hes talking like he wants us to be
the fist to his voice What the fuck is that
 Yeah Yeah
 Sup
 We sampled
 Are we in the tavern
 Is anyone watching
 He didnt tell us a lot of anything
 Sorry I didnt mean to
 He got kicked into another dimension
 Oh its not funny
 But who kicks a fucking cat
 Well beat his ass later
 Well beat his ass later
 You know what we used to do as kids we
used to take fireflies and crush them and make
glow jewelry When theyd light up and youd
crush them right as they light up and then you
can make glowing war paint
 Its a thing that happens on the east
coast
 Yeah its a southern thing
 But you paid for it
 Its a posse
 Well maybe Dont let us hold you down
if you want to go enjoy
 Being alone is sucky right
 Okay no questions Just scouting them
out Yeah yeah
 Have we been here yet
 Theyre bouncers like rough bouncers at
that bar
 Hes the bartender
 Well take a round of your house ale if
you dont mind
 Clive

 Do you have any beers on tap Oh no just
the two Okay Interesting Feels like this is a front
 Yeah Maybe we finish our drink and move
on for now

DM
 We learned so much today you guys

 Some lox and bagels
 Where in Virginia
 Are we making our way back
 Okay lets go back
 Is that a thing
 The greed of the Crown man
 I love the rain
 Lets go to sleep
 Okay thats a good idea I hate ticking
or repetitive noises Thats so obnoxious
 That Exactly like that
 That counts as well
 Yeah
 The same umbrella category yeah
 We just woke up were real tired okay
 Jesus
 Youre super spooky at night you know
that
 Youre a little pale so you have this
ghostly quality to you I dont know why Im whispering
 Were all awake now
 You all right
 Maybe she was a ghost the whole time
 Thats heavy metal
 Thats a possibility
 She probably just took off to handle some
Yasha business right though
 Well ask Molly
 We go downstairs
 Thats better
 We were talking about a couple people
watching out front right
 Someone from your deepest imagination
 Greens pretty
 Maybe you have a cleft chin
 Yeah And very curly
 Yeah she did that thing again
 Does she sleep
 Shes a little creepy In like a hot
way but a little creepy
 Yeah kind of
 Its very mysterious
 I mean we all have personal issues
 Who You
 Us
 Yeah It did seem very pointed and
targeted
 See Im having a hard time myself
getting through to Caleb so I feel like its hard
for an asshole to teach an asshole
 I should punch him in the face
 I was having a side conversation
 You can learn a lot of things from being
punched in the face
 Maybe we can also take the day to ask
around and get a little bit more of a bead on the
opinions of the locals on the current political
climate
 Youre very smart Jester
 Are you going
 Youre going to the fancy place
 Hes going with Jester Yeah Ill go
with you guys
 Along the way can I look for a tailor
 Fucking balls Seven Someone who can sew
me a custom coat a cloak or add a lining to
something like that
 Do they do custom there
 Thats fine
 Done
 I would like to take one of their cloaks
and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible
 Like one of those baggier poncho coats
One of those
 Thank you sir

 Like a tiki bar
 Maybe we can go shopping and come back
 Im following by the way
 Oh my god
 Its because this whole place is magical
Caleb
 Does there appear to be a used book
section like tradeins
 Huh Okay You can learn a lot from what
people wrote in books
 Hey Jester Do you think that the fact
that this place is called Chastitys Nook gives
everyone a complex who shops here
 Yeah
  Aw you beat me to it
 I would love to see it right now
 Do you have a sample
 What is it
 Shes very heavyhanded with her
innuendos
 They keep talking about the heft of his
equipment A lot of reference to his equipment
 Yeah its Do you
 Oh do I
 Fuck I was thinking of Fjord as I was
trying to be nice
 Its cocked right Okay thank you 
 You know there seems to be a lot of
machinery knowledge and like heavy machinery
knowledge Was that also an interest of yours

combined
 Consider me interested
 Yeah I almost asked if there was Is
there a mailing list You got to get the word out
Get people interested

all the blossoms off the flowers as I go

any colors
 Just looking Just you know people
watching
 These two assholes up there on the top of
the Zauber Spire
 Hey the whole Cerberus Assembly thing
Do you know much about them
 Yeah no I know Were both empire kids
right More so than the rest of the Nein
 What do you think about the empire 
About the crown
 Okay I think its kind of bullshitty
 I dont know look at this Look at how
much money is up here compared to elsewhere This
is a lot of control
  
 No I just want to make a ton of money
and drink a lot of booze
 I think best we can do is try and be
happy in as you said this shitty situation that
weve all been granted
 Yeah Anyway should we go
 Mind if I take a look at it
 Im going to flip through it Does
anything catch my eye based on what I know
 You know this reminds me of the stuff
that I used to read back in school
 No like all the history stuff It feels
like a bored monk wrote this A real bored monk
 I might read it later when youre done
reading it
 Really
 Its a great gift Honestly I was
thinking about buying it and then you beat me to
it Great minds right
 Whats this book called Does it have a
name
 I know Yeah Im not going to be able to
type that in Ill write that down
 You see why I left this town Ugh
people
 Good when you all are good
  Okay
 Before you leave real quick Beau asks
you if you found any information out while you
were on your journey
 Really Im with it
 Right Interesting We went to the fancy
end of town where Im pretty sure everyone is
super into the crown because they are all funded
by the crown and they are the crown so I was like
eh probably a bad place to start asking political
questions
 We did yeah Went to a smut shop
 As to be expected Smutty What should we
do
 Yeah in case its a trap or something
 Also we know that people are looking for
these type of rebels If we can see a board
ratting people out so can other people We dont
want to get caught in a sting operation for lack
of a better term
 Yeah
 Big money Are you fucking serious
 Wait theyre both threes I rolled two
threes Both threes
 Four so seven
 Can you try and pick this
 Oh my god Im going to stand watch in
the opening of the alley Im going to make sure
while he does this
 We could get Nott in here to try and pick
it Just leave it nicely looked like its not opened
 Yeah Ill be right back Nott
 I hate to interrupt your dinner Can we
borrow you for a quick second
 Can you pick this
 Yeah
 Yeah He takes one end I take the
other
 Jesus fucking ballsacks
 Seven again
 Oh that sucks Oh I have thieves tools
Can I try
 I give Nott my thieves tools
 Yeah I stole them off of a really rich
guy
 Yeah
 Youll just owe me later how about
that
 I put on the goggles
 Its not the same cellar
 Theres no entrances No secret
entrances No trap doors hiding behind barrels
 Dont fuck this up this time come on
 Its cocked on a 
 What
 Well Okay What am I doing
Investigation 
 Any good bottles of wine or brews laying
around
 Theres a skeleton down here
 Did they not clean when they bought this
place
 Yeah
 Hang on no ones around right
 Im going to pull out my adventurers kit
and light a torch because fuck this darkvision shit
 No one knows were down here right The
doors closed
 Okay Do we see anything else weird More
dead bodies anything like that
 Thats really gross
 Yeah anything else now that I have the
light on I dont see anything
 Shit  I take one of those
bottles of beer then I leave
 Frumpkin I dont know
 Lets do that
 You can Message Caleb
 Or any of us
 Okay Any other prep we should do
 Okay lets do this
 Get food Ill read some of my book
 Iva
 Go kill
 That feels a little premature
 I want to know who he is though
 Super interested to find out who this guy
is I feel like we should deal with one thing
Im super focused on this current
 Last thing we want is to take the fall
for these assholes whoever they are
 Read the book
 You go back and forth
 Conflict between the Julous Dominion
 Dwendalian Emp
Thats good 
 Theo okay
 Ruined forever
 Okay test of wits Like Dinner with
Andre style
 The assassin removed his helmet
 Wait am I writing down smut right now
 Hang on Are you going into how Theo and
the assassin had a thing
 Okay keep going Im into it though
This has to be important
 Hes telling it to me
 Okay
 Hes a dark elf right Or a drow
 Thats cool
Its meant as an intimidation tactic Its this highpitched
screaming cricket chirp that rushes in so thats
where the term Crick comes from It is used in a
derogatory fashion towards individuals who live
within the empire of Xhorhas and Kryn The book
talks about them dueling wits finding common
ground and getting angry at each other and
murderous then turns into this torrid love affair
in this very AnthonyCleopatra feel to it Its
very dry Its an older book It doesnt match
some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other
smut that you briefly perused as you were walking
in the bookstore earlier You glean a little bit
of information should this be accurate at all of
some of the relationships or dynamics of the
empire and the Xhorhasian folk that live beyond
the border
 Would I be able to discern where the
assassin entered into the city
 Its not like by the third lamppost
remove this brick Okay cool
 This book sucks
 Halfway maybe
 Couple hours
 Yeah Tton it is
 Yeah Lets do this
 Okay
 Table right
 Is it just the four of them No more
 Okay
 Yeah we sit Its polite
 A valuable asset Good with things
 Thrym
 The human male
 Especially considering you said the
Richter was already pretty corrupted Seems like
assassination attempts in reverse wouldnt be out
of her bailiwick
 Heres my question to Dolan why do you
want Horris wants to be in the office
 Dolan what makes you think that you can
beat the system that you would then be joining
 Yeah sorry about that
 Well you could do a lot with a seal from
a lord A lot more than claiming an assassination
attempt Just throwing it out there
 Literally anything else
 Its an okay name
 You could workshop it Theres always
more names
 There was also the notice on the Kings
Hall looking for yall I dont know if you knew
that by the way I imagine a notice in one of
these peoples houses might mean that they have
concern of being found
 You could win twice
 Now the Lawmaster works under the
HighRichter right
 Yeah
 Kara I think its Kara
 I like that Tell us about this Myriad a
little bit What is it exactly that you guys are
so nervous about with these people
 What name should we be looking for
 Ill give you one piece of advice Dolan
though I would challenge you to think about this
for the night think real long and hard if youre
willing to jump into the ring Some pretty
highranking asshole gladiators Should probably
be willing to take a few licks Shut up
 You know make sure you know what youre
getting into
 Awful people
 Powerful tricks Thats all
 Crazy
 I agree Who knows We cant be replacing
someone corrupt with someone even worse
 Yeah we dont know anything about this
Dolan this Horris motives or their agenda
 Should we go now
 We would have told you the two humans
Two humans
 House rule
 Yeah just a clown
 Actually that was pretty cool You
learned something
 I agree
 Yeah maybe we can even split a team
some people go and spy on the house some people
maybe go to the stockade talk to the people shes
locked up
 Im down for that
 Well is Ulog still sitting at the other
table
 At this hour
 Interesting
 I dont do anything for altruistic
reasons
 Well if this plan gets pulled off and
we help Dolan get in that seat of the
HighRichter than we suddenly have friends in
high places And I love an owed favor
 Yeah
 Start there why not
 Is The Pillow Trove still open
 We can try and ask there huh
 I know thats what I was thinking
 Sleeping
 No more Oskar for you
 Should I not
 Yeah see what you can find Have I
finished it I havent finished it
 Ill give it to him its fine He needs
a little self confidence a little encouragement
 Lot of great shirts in the store Great
shirts
 Thats so great
 Can we go to sleep now
 Did you find anything good in this
 It doesnt really ultimately matter but
I feel like that was like a toxic relationship I
didnt really feel like the assassin and Theo
should have I mean he led to her death That
kind of sucks
 Did you get a book
 Circuit judge
 I have this inventory sheet that I got
from the Baumbauchs we could use this as claims
that it got stolen And hope for reimbursement
 This is like an order invoice that I
have right
 No the order ledger
 No but in that I have an order ledger
 So we could claim that he never paid due
and we are looking for some sort of representation
to try and get our money from the Baumbauchs
 Does it say on the ledger the company
that it came from Does it say like from Dryer
Supply and Co
 Me Me being an asshole
 The Timalt Store House
 So it can be from the Timalts
 They never paid due on the order that we
sent them
 No theyre in Trostenwald
 Timalt is from here right
 They are in Zadash They made a
shipment
 Regardless its just a story so we can
get a bead on her right
 Thats not bad
 What time is it
 Is it early enough to where on my way
there I can pick up my custom coat
 Okay
 Are we trying to go through the sewer
 We can still find the back sewer entrance
have Nott pop the lock and we know how to go
 With my coat kind ofish
 Were going to have to distract them
 Yes So into this
 Is the sewer locked
 That was awesome
 Ooh that guy is definitely arrested
 Were all rolling stealth
 
 Can I take the brown side of my newly
purchased reversible coat take out my Brewers
Kit that I have and take a few of the bottles and
fashion them to my waist a little bit
 Awesome Okay lets ask around and find
where this Richter lives
 Lawrence is great Worked for me before
 Actually no Lets do something else
considering I already used Lawrence once
 Francis Francis Titmalt Timalt not
Titmalt
 Lets go
 Super official
 I think it was a fundraiser last time
you were up for election
 Especially that Demedan
 She directed us here we thought well
Dayana is just so sweet she would of course help
us out
 Here is the invoice from the amount due
that they have not paid from the Timalt Store House
 Oh my god what should I roll Give me
something good Thats not too bad 
 And of course we would happily pay you
for any type of additional services you might be
able to help us out with
 No I dont think those were my words at
all No
 And of course we are always willing to
repay in favors
 While he wraps it up can I do a quick
glance over her table or over her desk to see if I
see any type of papers
 Oh I thought she pulled us inside Im
sorry
 Okay
 Thats what we were looking for this
whole time
 Its hard to find good help these days
 Go guys Lets go
 But were assholes without power though
 I dont know its less dangerous I
dont know
 Its that harvest fest Remember theres
another tournament and stuff that we can enter into
 I mean look People in power tend to get
corrupt they dont start corrupt In my opinion
it doesnt matter whos sitting there as long as
we get paid from it who cares
 Yeah I guess lets head there meet up
with these guys Its probably about that time yeah
 Before we walk into the place I turn my
coat inside out back to the blue
 It doesnt look like anyone followed us
in
 Okay
 Fjord and I will go over
 Is that a problem
 Hey friend
 People like her make you uncomfortable
 You sure What about people like him
People like him make you uncomfortable
 All right just checking
 Hes fucking everywhere Hes been
following us a lot You said he was shifty a
little criminal
 Wait  from his personal stash
  Just under 
 Breaking in
 That is really nice Thats good
 You could do this some graphic design
 If anything I feel bad Feels like
theyre investing a lot of money on this play
 If hes HighRichter
 Correct It would be super unfortunate to
see someone else slide in there other than him
But like you said not our problem
 We have a little bit of time We can
still do a little bit of casing maybe go talk to
the Gentleman and see what he has to offer in
between
 Right A day and a night
 We got to go back to the TriSpire Which
we can do
 Is that where Lord Sutan is
 In the TriSpire
 He respawned
 Okay well at dawn we plan
 At dawn we plan
 I think were going to have to reignite
our planning thread
 Its time
 Yeah Dust the cobwebs off of it
 Its good Were going to go full Oceans
Nein you guys
 And bear claws
 Dayana Prucine
 Oh Orentha
 I think it might also be smart to see if
we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for
possibly both the Lord Sutan and the HighRichter
so we can more convincingly forge documents
 With his brain
 With his head
 Youre good at forging right
 We have to get some handwriting samples
right Of the Lord and the HighRichter that way
we can write letters make it seem like theyre
 Nott I think were going to need you to
both break in the house and also maybe into some
safe that they have in there
 Yeah youre good at lockpicking
 No well be with you
 You can say it
 Nott what was the last thing Caleb
said
 What did he say
 Thats not what he said but that is
delicious and now I want some
 I have
 I am definitely proficient in mail fraud
 There would be a public record somewhere
right
 And generally those public records tend
to need to be open for
 Well I will say worst case scenario we
dont necessarily need to match her handwriting
but some type of coding potentially linked back
to her We can almost mimic it People who are
doing sneaky things never use their real
handwriting
 Sure Maybe some accounts of the Myriad
 of Requital Where I thought you were
going Molly which isnt a bad idea to leave some
sort of money trail is leave a certain amount of
money with any type of paperwork that might also
be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house
So paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich
people right So they always have these safes
filled with documents
 Were you guys paranoid
 Yeah
 We also need to find where Lord Sutan
lives
 Correct
 They might even have some sort of
documentation or record Remember Dolan was saying
that they got ousted from their practice because
of this Lord Sutan Maybe they already have a
paper trail
 We do Nott tracked them
 Do we have any
 Thats going to be really cool when I can
do that Really cool Catch a fly Anyway moving
on that was me
 I wonder if we can track down Ulog
 You think were big fish
 I tie my robe
 Its all Ive got
 No I got that Yeah
 Okay well then you go
 Feel free to give me like a
 Ill listen for the pigeon
 Theres a signal we have one
 Do I see sorry
 Knew that much
 This is really good all to know Now
were getting all this information
 I dont know Id say take the
footinmouth signal
  Mustard Biscuits
 What did they say though
 Okay All right Yep
 Im keeping an eye out for anyone
watching
 Oh and its super interesting
 Also super interesting that they
mentioned having other people do their work for
them  Okay lets go
 He said they have other people do parcel
service and stuff for him
 See
 Well maybe not even a signature Most
people trying to be smart about not getting caught
arent probably like my name and social security
number
 You want stationery sure
 Okay well how about this I think the
seal is going to be good I think any type of
money amount mentioned in any of the letters and
then we cross that and leave that type of amount
of gold in the like theres been a money hand
off
 In between Adventureland and
Frontierland

 Yeah yeah yeah
 Okay well how about half of us go to
Lord Sutans and half of us go check out Rens
 Ill go to check out Ren
 I could get through the gate
 Okay
 Ill go check out yeah
 We can manage ourselves
 Were good
 We got this lets go
 What time is it
 The Leaky or the Song  Supper Were
talking about two different Leaky Tap
 Hour and a half all right
 Break
 I flip it to the blue side cobalt
 Oh Im
 Literally like  hours ago
 Thank you
 Are the gates chained shut or does it
look like theres a lever
 Two in front Does it look like theres
any blind spots any trees that go up and cusp over
the walls
 Not good Eleven
 Its a big jump but we can do it Its
not too big
 Thats doable yeah
 From rooftop to wall
 That was what I was thinking wall to
wall
 Do they look like one of the
 No balcony So there appear to be
 No balcony okay
 Uhhuh
 A dog I like dogs
 Yeah maybe a drunk A drunkard trying to
break in somewhere else
 You know a public disturbance
 Yeah
 I mean our group is pretty good at
causing distractions
 They can do that Thats totally
 Yeah Its going to have to go fast
 Yeah we could do that
 Do I have a climbers kit
 I dont have a climbers kit but we can
go buy a climbers kit
 Yeah Okay
 Guys lets challenge ourselves We have
to break in only using ball bearings
 How do we do it
 Yeah Do there seem to be any weak
points any loose bricks in the walls
 As we walk by Im playing with the wall
but Im testing for weak spots
 Oh
 I understand now
 Oh theres no
 Okay
 You know when I used to hop fences back
where I came from
 If youre ever trying to get over
barbedwire or any pointy fences you take a rug
or a bedroll and you throw it over there and you
hop over and you
 Yeah I mean
 Im just throwing that out there It
works
 A bedroll is not too bad
 Yeah yeah yeah lets go
 Sure
 
 Were just trying out the gym Were not
fully committed to it yet
 All right
 Second time your cat just vanished
 Simon
 Its name was Princess
going to create such a fuss
 Come on stage makeup class
 This is going to be the weirdest fanart
 Ooh I hate him I hate him already
 Id like to say I feel pretty good about
our casing mission
 In the meantime me and Jester are like

Whats taking them so long
 He took an hour to cosplay his dick
 Why are you covered in mayonnaise and
egg
 And hot sauce Is that hot sauce
 You guys look real defeated over here
You look palpably defeated
 What
 You what
 All right
 You know this could lead back to make it
look suspicious if we go after Lord Sutan if his
son was just broken into right
 Hes going to know his medical notes are
missing right
 All right okay
 Sure sure All right
 Well I mean that works because as Dolan
said these fancy people tend to get other people
to write their mail and do their paperwork for
them so
 Yeah that never changed
 Nott over here knows a little bit of
Thieves Cant
 It would look shifty
 Im just saying from my experience
normally if youre trying to do a coup
 As a rebellious teenage woman In my
experience normally if youre trying to do
something bad youre not like Dear diary I did
this bad thing Signed Beauregard You get what
Im putting down
 Correct We want to look if its too
obvious its the opposite of convincing
 This guy goes by The Gentleman because he
is smart Thats all Im saying
 Spoke to The Myriad yeah
 It doesnt really matter
 And a little bribery if were trying to
go for something
 It depends If youre just handing money
off to an assassin If its a lowly level person
might not need much Doesnt need to be the whole
amount Just needs to be a payment maybe
 The Big O thing The plan against the Big
O
 It will commence 
 Commence as discussed
 And it sounds super boss
 Aw you beat me to it No signing it with
a kiss
 What kind of dog
 Can the cat become a mastiff
 Heres the deal Nott
 Yeah we need to leave no trace The only
way this gets pulled off is if
 Is if no one thinks anyone was there
Ever
 We also have good ol Fjord who can
always disguise himself as a guard
 Correct
 I think thats a good idea
 A few papers are always good
 Why is there a Magic pack in there
 Beau gets a little too aggressive with
the pillow fight
 Sorry sorry
 Should we get some awesome allblack
clothes
 Yeah something a little bit more
stealthy
 Oh I like that
 I see what youre saying Yeah
 Do we know anything about this festival
like culturally Do they wear masks
 I think we should go shopping
 Masks on sticks
 But will it get us through the gate
 Are you afraid theyre not party people
 Well then we go from there
 Shes got a point
 Show us where Melrose is
 Leave it in the trash Thats not bad
thats not bad
 Man that is the oldest trick in the
book Sure
 Dont write the Knights though just
write the little symbol
 To fight Orentha to kill her
 I feel so political you guys I feel
like Im participating in our politics in a way
 It does it feels like Im making a
difference
 Feels like it matters
 Yeah we didnt get paid in advance I
hope that doesnt come back to bite us
 Once again we should leave no trace that
we were there
 Correct so first
 With the cat Weve got the cat plan
 Yeah the last thing we want is for the
crownsguard to think that this was all us
 In front of the
 I was going to say can we hop a ride
 No that brings a lot of attention
chasing after a carriage
 That doesnt mean that wont change in 
seconds
 Do you want to distract him and well
meet you on the other side
 Okay Nott or Caleb can send you a
message
 
 Why is that their natural response in
this town
 Ratballoons
 Oh fuck
 Shit We were supposed to go fucking meet
Ulog Damn it
 We recapped this at the break too Damn
it
 Oh come on Ulog
 Its open mic night You got this

 
 Oh shit We almost forgot about Ulog
 Oh shit
 How well do you know Lord Sutans place
and the area
 All right
 Yeah
 The fiviest
 I hate the color yellow
 I just hate it
 Any of them look familiar
 Dont fuck me Gil Meh you kind of
fucked me there
 Ten
 Fuck
 Why does it feel like you roll crappier
when youre lower level 
 Same guard
 Are we catching them around the same
time This is his shift Same watch
 All right
 All the way around With the spikes
 And the gate is closed
 But he can still be enough of a
distraction to get the guard to chase the dog
while we get in if we can get the dog
 Maybe to the front side
 Thats what I was thinking Go into the
cellar
 As soon as the dog chases away the cat
 Well
 Maybe thats when Fjord can come and
relieve the guards
 Or he can do that now But how do we get
Fjord on the other side of the gate
 What were those guards names There were
so many guards
 Yeah but as long as you do a guard
thats semirecognizable
 Yeah but spikes
 All right
 All right Up the tree
 Ill go first so I can try and help
anyone else as I go up Can I do that
 Athletics or acrobatics
 
 But parkour
 Thats not great
 I got to get up there
 Eight
 Give me a boost
  Sorry
 
 Im sprinter Im not an endurance
person Okay
 Youre strongest
 Oh god
 Dont let it get caught
 I dont know what to do
 Is it flying out of our grasp 
is that whats happening
 Shes going to try and catch it
 Wait
 Quiet shut up
  Okay maybe if I get over I
could hold the other end and help people
 I think I can
 Look were basically gods okay

 I can make this jump
 Im going to cast step of the wind
Sorry not cast it Im going to use a ki point
Im going to take a breath gather my
chi Along the edge of the branch anime run
 Step of the wind gives me like double
jump distance or triple jumpdump jist
 Hang on
 
 I dont trust Gil right now Im not
going to trust Gil
Im going to go with cobalt die
Natural 
 I go along the rope and tighten the rope
as I land
 I was like tracing the rope
 When do we do the cat
 The cat
 There is a chimney stack though right
 What Who would have a door on the roof
 I look around Is there a door on the
roof
 
 Okay
 It looks like they need to reroof Like
they havent done it in about  years Right
 So maybe we could get in Or go through
the cellar Or be like Santa Claus
 Its happening now Its real time Real
time I think
 There was a guard named Cloen who was
the guard who saw the spider
 Just throwing that out there
 Got to get through this roof
 I step around How do the shingles feel
 Nott
 Do you have a dagger
 Can I borrow it
 Can I borrow any bladed thing Thank
you
 Im going to jack it up and see if I
can
 Does it feel like a trap door
 Oh my god
 Yeah pull up the shingles
 Those could be valuable
 Are they clay shingles Very valuable
 Yeah 
 Okay Do you want to let them know that
were going in
 Then Beau will go down first
 I do the cool thing where like I slide
down like a fireman down the ladder a little bit
 Well I look real cool for five feet

 Remember when we lost  platinum at the
bottom of the Bag of Holding last campaign for
months That was funny
 Yes Oh thats where I put that
 We universally forgot it as a team
 Molly do you think this is the weapon
from the crime scene that we saw That big glowy
black
 See Extremely powerful
 Does it look like the same color from the
gauntleted hand that we saw in the alley
 Lets wake him up
 Super baity
  Go ahead and jump
 By the way last time Travis did this I
jumped off of a cliff and splatted as a goldfish
 We could be heroes Turn him in invaders
in chains
 That is true these guys were called
Cricks
 If anything was true in the porn you can
always trust porn to be honest
 Theres always truth to porn
 This guy is from the Dwendalian Empire
from the Julous Dominion
 Yeah
 Remember the porn It was a very awkward
reading
 The Marrow Valley What was
 The army of Julous
 Oh conflict between the Julous Dominion
and the Dwendalian Empire And she was a general
for the Dwendalian empire
 She was super in love with this general
named Theo
 Theo
 Oh he does speak Common
 Halfelves did I remember team
halfelves did
 No
 Do you mean rebirth or do you mean
reanimate Lets be honest here
 Oh jeez
 Is this thing what we saw take out half
the Zauber Spire
 Is it just the two of you or were there
more
 Who was your help if it was just the two
of you
 It has to be someone in the city Who was
it You dont tell us well find out one way or
another I can tell you that right now
 You can either help us get there faster
or well just take the long goddamn way
 He looks like a good reward to me
Unless under one condition You tell us who you
were working with in here
 Is it Kara Dolan
 Exactly Anything Any reactions
 Yeah can me and Fjord tag team this
 Yeah lets just each roll Were just
going down the list
Fucking fuck
 Better than me 
 What He hasnt told us shit
 Just leave him He can get out himself
Hes a smart guy
 Ooh was it the Gentleman
 We could pawn this thing Right now
Itll be off of our tail in like two minutes
 What if he comes back and destroys us
with this thing in six months Two months
 And super different than five seconds ago
when you said we should just let him go
 Does it scare you that much
 If its that scary then what do you want
to do with it
 Or we can take it now and kill him
later
 Just saying it could be like a fun game
 Look I know some people Why dont we
bag this thing up and well take it right over to
 Okay Im not talking about anything
 New plan
 New plan All right we cant decide if
we should leave him or take the thing or take
the thing but leave him or kill him or why
dont we take both him and the thing
 We go to the Cobalt Soul Drop him off
Front doorstep leave a note Youre welcome
 And apparently so are we Or at least
talking about it
 They hold information Theyve got a
decent amount of relics and spell books and things
that they might know
 And theyre technically a little bit
separate from the city Theyre kind of not
necessarily a part of the empire They kind of
make sure the empire stays in check
 The Dwendalian Empire
 No wait sorry I meant Xhorhas
 Right
 Were letting him leave without the
beacon
 And hes not going to take it
 I still say we load up both of these
guys
 Okay he definitely does not get a secret
disguise to help him get through the city
 Just saying it feels like were leaving
an opportunity in the sewer
 Nope
 Should we follow him See where hes
going
 Just saying maybe theres some cool
portal or something
 How are they getting in and out man
 Is he heading deeper into the sewers the
way the spiders were
 I dont care about wars between empires
I just like having more information For later
 I should have just strapped him up
 We had control of it when it was still in
our hands We dont have control anymore
 What did you say you said were down
one
 What happened to Ulog
 Yeah We dont want to be a part of
this
 We were working at the festival Were
just trying to get out man
 I say sir we have coworkers that were
working at the festival Do you know anything
about this attack
 As we walk Im going to ask Fjord did
you catch any weird twitches or any signs that he
was lying
 You know maybe we were assholes for not
noticing that him handing over his entire life
savings was a little suspicious
 I dont think we got it
 Which is pretty dope
 All right lets all be clear that
whatever the empire wants theyll fucking take
 You can disguise yourself You can
disguise yourself as Crick
 Im definitely super injured but this
sounds fun
 Theyre in an alleyway
 Im going to parkour elf get on the
Elf Monk get on the roof of the nearest building
 Okay okay okay 
 Natural 
 Wheres Nott Where are you
 Come on come on come on
 I follow Caleb as he traces around but
on the roof
 I crouch down on the roof above Caleb
and I go 
 Come on Caleb
 Trying to avoid the paparazzi
 Im on the roofs been tracking Caleb
this whole time On the roof
 I drop down in front of the kids
Batmanstyle
 Dont take my fucking line before I get a
chance to say it
 Close but different motive
 Whatcha buying kids
 You know that shit will fucking kill you
right
 With advantage
 Jesus a natural one and a four So
five
 I take out my staff and I say
 Do your
parents know youre out this late Or are you
trying to prove something
 And just for Taliesin I say
 Stay in
school

 Yeah
 Im going to stealth and try to track
back towards Caleb But make sure no one else is
also following him
 I dont think we should go back to the
Song  Supper
 Fjord and I found an additional cellar
where we found that skeleton behind the Leaky
Tap Doesnt look like anybody
  Thank you for joining
us for Fantasma The park is now closed
  It was just like
that cat I kicked the other day
 Nott remember that additional cellar
behind the Leaky Tap
 Uhhuh
 I think that might be safe
 It was super dead Like no ones been
there for a super long time
 Super clean bones Like at least two
years Id say
 I think we can wait until morning
though Hows the city looking Are people
ransacking Are there looters
 Okay Its not that bad
 Break
 You think the whole damn thing was a
fucking distraction
 I really dont like being used Whos at
the bar Is there anyone at the bar
 Clay Owens
 Hey Clay hows it going Long night
 I know right Can I go ahead and get a
double to help with the night
 Had anyone come in tonight Any one of
the usuals Seen Ulog Seen Kara
 Yeah
 All right You didnt see them rush out
with anybody
 Mention where they were going
 I think he got food poisoning from the
finger food at the gala You should never trust that shit
 All right Well thanks Clay
 Slam it Lets go
 Oh I give him a gold
 Oh Im sorry I was Its just the
Just keep it Its just the stress of the night
 Sorry Im a little maybe next time
its a round on you right
 Okay bye All right lets go
 No why
 Oh my tolerance is like
 Its at an unhealthy level Lets go
 Yeah lets see if those guys are there
 Natural 
 Someones hiding
 Yeah sure make sure they dont try and
run
 Nope Im still out back
  Fjord Are you dead
 While all this was going on can I do a
quick little casing intelligence to see if
theres any thrownaway trash burned evidence or
anything in the back
 Fucking fuck you Gil Six
 Did he let me in
 Theres a little town not far from here
called Alfield It might actually have use for a
doctor right about now
 Wait Before you guys leave It doesnt
matter based on whats just happened Is there
anything that you guys know that we didnt about
any other of the members of the Knights of
Requital that might have a more invested interest
in an invasion or getting back at anyone in the
Zauber Spire Sorry Yes That was the right one
 Seems like you all had your own
individual motives for why you were part of the
Knights of Requital You sure yours was just
because you wanted to be the HighRichter
 Always have someone check your work
 Sounds like half the clubs in LA
 Fuck
All right Ill go up and see what they are saying
 I was just about to say Jesters
everyones little sister when youre a senior in
high school
 Why are so many fucking people trying to
skip town
 Dont take no for an answer
 We almost killed a guy and then someone
else killed a guy we still reaped all the
rewards Good for us guys Good for us
 Ey represent
 Upstairs yeah Convene inroom
 Its all right
 Yeah its down feathers all over the
place
 Wheres Caleb He downstairs
 Whats the last thing he said
 Makes sense
 How much
 Shpizich
 Wait what
 I thought we just sent him on his way
 Aw fuck I thought
 Did you bring me that drink Oh sit
down
 Sorry
 I was mentioning Alfield but really
its up to him I guess I dont care
 We walked in on him and his boy trying to
skip town
 Well he said he only wanted to be gone a
week though right
 You do know that leaving town itself is
suspicious in its own right right Just throwing
it out there
 But you have an alibi Its hard to have
an alibi when you mysteriously
 I dont give a shit what you
 Yeah Claudia Also skipping town
 She knew we were holding all those
backroom meetings right She helps you guys quite
a lot
 How many platinum 
 And two gold
 Yeah
 I didnt expect you to wear platforms
 I look at Molly and I take out my bo
sword See if anything happens
 Yeah
 I mean I told him I was attacking
  total
 Oh sorry I thought we were just
wrestling a little
 Ow Fuck
 Do I feel anything
 Yeah a fucking headache
 Do the daggers seem special
 Im going to take one of the daggers and
I throw it against the windowsill
 Seal Damn it thats true What did you
say
  Dont fuck me Gil  Sorry

 I mean that was pretty awesome right
 Thats true
 I think what Fjord meant was
 can yall
be trusted
 Very valid question
 Seems like hes taken a few things that
hes afraid of
 Wait what happened
 You do realize that missing things mean
leaving a trace right
 You realize youre not helping your case
right
 Wed already fucked up the rug we
probably shouldnt fuck up anyone elses house We
were already implicated at one place right
 Are you aware of what Stockholm Syndrome
is
 Yeah
 Yeah its an Emon thing
 It doesnt matter wait
 Okay hang on before we turn this into a
pissing contest
 Its not about earning each others
trust Look I have worked with some skeevey
motherfuckers in my day very unsavory types But
you know what I trust That they have their own
selfpreservation right So I can trust that
these motherfuckers dont want to get caught and
that they dont want to die at the end of the day
If you want to do something skeevey on the side
let me know I will help you out But when we are
all working as a team I dont want your actions
to get me in fucking trouble
 We dont have to trust each other but
when we are working on a job together I want to
know that you care enough about yourself that
youre not going to get me in trouble
 Fuck you Molly
 I agree with that
 When you want to grab something for
yourself you let me know and you go grab it for
yourself I dont have to be a part of it When we
choose one objective together I can only trust
that you are in it with us We can be selfish as a
group and then be selfish as individuals
 Is there
 Youre not the only one who can have the
same interests in keeping each other safe
 Oh yeah thanks
 Man super shame that Calebs not here
for this entire conversation
 Lets go down there why dont we camp in
the cellar
 I mean not as nice as what they said if
he ever does anything to get me fucking locked up
I will beat him so fucking bad his ancestors on
the next plane wont fucking recognize him
 Thanks Im trying real hard
 Yeah progress I am an HR liability
 You caught him stealing your stuff
 You caught her stealing your stuff
 This is the most Ive liked either one of
you motherfuckers
 And I pull out my bo And I put it down
and I say but Ill find ya If anything else happens
 Yall dont fucking know me

 So smaller than this
 Did any of us hear it from the second
floor

 Santa Klaus
 Oh

 Are we doing the level four thing or we
doing it after
 Okay
 Ill kill you in your sleep Okay bye
 Grab all the dice Grab all the dice
 d for the monk as well A four Right
down the middle
 Plus my con modifier yeah
 Weve got to figure out what were doing
with this thing
 Yeah Kara
 She was the most shifty bitch
 She never said a whole lot
 Shes the one I arguably know the least
about
 Well Jester and I know the code to talk
to the Gentleman if we ever want to do that
 Generally when a city is on lockdown
though the sewers is the first place that guards
are looking for shady people to leave
 Wheres our cart We still have our gypsy
wagon
 No we havent

 Is our cart in the city or is it outside
the city
 We can bury him under a pile of produce
or something like that try and sneak him out of
the city
 Also you know who we havent checked up
on Bryces sister Right Her sister
 Their sister sorry Bryces sister
 Is Broken Veil the name of a tavern here
or was it in Alfield
 I think I messed up and I wrote down
where she is but I dont know where
 No wait
 Yes Bryce is in Alfield
 Yeah Feelid Bryce Feelid Watchmaster
Bryce Feelid Elf Leader of the guard Very sweet
person These are all the things I wrote down
 Bryce despises the Dwendalian Empire
thinks they get no support being so far south from
the Dwendalian Empire Hes not from this region
And then I wrote down Broken Veil and Bluffs
 Youre unprepared
 So I didnt I dont have the name of
her damn
 Their damn sister
 I think Caleb was because it was right
when we said we were going to Zadash and Bryce was
like Go look at this person Sorry I choked on
my spit
 Wait is Claudia his sister
 Am I going around in circles
 It was Claudia Was it Claudia this whole
time
 It was Claudia Never mind
 And get Horris out first right
 Yannick and Jan
 Our blacksmith is Taika Waititi So into
it
 You all keep talking about this Pumat Sol
guy
 No I dont do the magic stuff I tend to
do other things
 Oh really
 See it feels like an inside joke
 So you started stealing stuff in the
first house
 We had the talk with her
 Thats pretty good though
 Wait what are you agreeing with That
hes nice or that hes working for the Empire
 Okay
 The two arent mutually exclusive We
know that right He can be nice and working for
the Empire
 The fuck
 Sup
 Little clammy
 I was thinking the same thing
 Ill go in on it What was in the box
though originally
 How much to make it my concern
 Im right here I can hear you all
talking about me
 Any other healing potions you got
 Ill take one more as well
 Taliesin are you seeing wait no Are
you seeing the potion of healing

 I got one
 What is happening
 What is hiding in those corners though
 He runs the Hall of Erudition
 That guys crazy
 Gah

  Fuck
 Get that
 I bet we could go back to the Chastitys
Nook for that
 Its called The Daring Tales
 I make sure its still there
 He didnt bring anything back to life

 But now we can put the dodecahshitball
in the box and now the box in the bag right
 Still crossing the streams
 All right all right

to come back
 I respect her ability to handle her own
shit on her own time
 Theyre pretty great So I strap on the
big gothy boots
 Super tall Doc Martens lots of little
furlined lots of straps and zippers
 How do they look
 Yeah its hard to tuck your pants into
your boots
 Theyre pretty great They add d to my
initiative roll
 Does anyone else feel like they might
benefit from these more than me
 Your initiative bonus is zero
 I feel like Nott might be able to do some
good with these too if she had them
 Okay Im sensing some passive
aggressive
 Thank you Nott
 Very good Thank you Thank you Nott
 Dont patronize me Nott
 Oh do I
 What kind of a saving throw
 Oh thats not good for me Nope
definitely not
  I am so happy
  Go talk to the Gentleman of
course
  General
 I feel like its all gone to shit
 I think thats exactly what this is
 Smiling is so painful
 
 Yeah
 Yeah youre actually yeah I dont
think youre so far off Theres something weird
thats been striking me with Dolan this whole
time He doesnt seem like he really has the
tenacity of someone who actually wanted that seat
Maybe he was a pawn this whole time That guy is
kind of a coward
 And I mean this with all due respect 
the guy was kind of a coward
 Thats how you do it right No
 I am really interested in this Kara girl
Im wondering if shes a puppet master throughout
this whole game
 This is Clive the bartender Hold Pause
Its something along the lines of Okay
 This is Clive the bartender right
 Yeah we are So Beau and Jester walk up

 Wait the goliath or the ogre
 The
 Okay
 Sucks being in the wrong place at the
wrong time
 Is this an investigation that you caused
to begin with
 Doing your bidding
 Through one of your associates
 I bet he edubates on that pile of gold

 Take the Pepsi challenge
 Some Inigo Montoya shit
 Kara knows him real well
 Yeah
 Does it look like hes speaking from
experience Hes a little twitchy
  
 Who were the two guys that said that they

ancient facility
 Just shifty roguey underbelly types
 My favorite pastime
 Want to accompany me
 Lets go

around to us
 Oh yeah When did you get in town
 What were you up to
 What
 Im doing a scan see if theres any
wandering eyes
 He definitely had a thing
 We go talk to Kara
 So you were deceiving us
 Thats a good one Have to remember that
one
 How much of this was orchestrated from
the beginning Were we a distraction for the
bigger picture
 Insight check
 

 Bring it to me
 All right You wont want to frame them
in any type of larger scheme considering it seems
like youre quite irritated with them
 Interesting How long have you been
working for the Gentleman
 Thats a long time
 Does he feel the same about the
Xhorhasian as you do
 You know its not as difficult to rally
a society of people against another Its not too
hard to start a war if you really want to
 Did Ulog and Dolan know about your
involvement with the Gentleman
 All right heres my question Ulog was
in against the HighRichter That was his
motivation Dolan wanted to get after Lord Sutan
for running him out of his practice
 What did you get out of all this
 Youre only in it to be a middleman No
goals or aspirations yourself
 Yeah You got a nice face Its good for
presentory purposes
 She does Look Shes got a good face
 That was a compliment Did it not
 That was a compliment All right Guess
well see you around
 I mean
 All right Lets go
 No thats great
 You guys made friends Good job
 Hello Critters We are back at the Time
Travel Mart in Echo Park California which is one
of the homes of our beloved LA and were going
to tell you about this amazing organization and
maybe play some Dungeons  Dragons Come on Ill
show you around

 You all probably remember this guy Joel
the executive director from LA Thank you so
much for having us and talking to us once again
Weve been doing this a few years now
together and I really appreciate the incredible
support youve given us over the years so thank
you
 Yeah arent the Critters such an amazing
group Weve heard rumors of people coming and
stopping by and volunteering yeah
and weve had volunteer orientations a few times a
month and theres always a good ten folks who show
up and when we ask them How did you hear about
us they talk about your show and its been a
huge help to us
 Oh my goodness that warms my heart so
much I love it Okay so give us a little bit of
a rundown on what  is and what you guys do for
all the amazing kids that come through here
We really want to get kids excited about writing
We want to honor their creativity and give them a
space where they can have fun and engage with
volunteers who can listen and help guide them in
their storytelling and in their writing We do
this after school tutoring we do night time
tutoring and we do workshops We also do a field
trip program and then we also go into schools all
across Los Angeles to provide this free
oneonone service to kids
 You guys have  chapters all over the
country correct
which is our umbrella organization out of San
Francisco We have chapters in San Francisco we
have one in New York in Chicago DC Michigan
Detroit Were actually opening one in New Orleans
very soon
  Hey NOLA
connected and we share resources and support each
other Were all independent nonprofits in our
cities but we collaborate and support each other
 I love it so much You guys have the Time
Travel Mart which is amazing if youre ever in
Los Angeles you have to come visit it You have
different themes for each of those across the
nation yeah
Marts here in Los Angeles Weve got the one here
that were in Echo Park and we have one in Mar
Vista which is from the s this ones the
s Time Travel Mart San Francisco has a pirate
store New York has a superhero supply store they
sell robot supplies in Michigan
  That all feeds right back into
the organization yeah
pay for the free services we provide to kids from
six to  years of age
 How did that even come about How did you
guys think to do that Its so brilliant
organization he was working with some volunteers
at our founding site in San Francisco and when
they were taking apart the place somebody said it
looked like the inside of a pirate ship So they
decided to build a pirate store in the front It
was a joke at first but people started leaving
money at the counter They didnt even have a
person who would take money people kept donating
and leaving money so it became a concept and all
the cities now have storefronts
 Now if people want to get involved in
LA or any of the s across the country how
is the best way to go about doing that
and theres a whole section for volunteers where
you could learn about what it takes to volunteer and
you can sign up for volunteer orientation All of
our chapters across the nation have their own
sites so folks can visit and get involved
 Awesome You dont necessarily have to
tutor if thats not your jam You can do many
things right
try to figure out ways to get all volunteers
involved We need help with design we need help
with copy editing we have a ton of projects that
we could always use help on
 Amazing All skill sets are appreciated
 Joel thank you as always for taking
the time
 All right well see you soon
 All right heres the deal
 we are
dedicating the next four weeks to our favorite
charity LA Now for every  dollars we
raise a new incentive will be unlocked for
everyone
 We want to go back to the Leaky Tap

probably check in on the dodecadoohickey as well
 Oh right she has it Never mind
 Yeah He was at the Leaky Tap right We
left him there
 Okay yeah Lets do that
 Going for the chair Im into it

blindfolded

 Dolan is staying Horris is getting out
of Dodge
 Horris have you heard anything while
weve been gone or have you been staying in here

 I thought he was coming with us when we
go to leave Thats what I thought
 Is that or am I mistaken
 Okay

ourselves on the way there so he just dont even

 Yeah
 Because if we take him down into the
Evening Nip with us then theyre going to want to
do the whole Let me take your blood thing and
You werent here and Who the fuck are you

 Did you look the same or did you come
back
 Did you wake up to people or alone
 How do you know she actually thinks its
you and not you know maybe she just mistook you
for someone actually named Lucien
 So this happens to you
 She kept referencing a book
 What if we could find the book
 Yes
 No Doesnt mean you have to find meaning
in meaningless things
 You know just because you know about your
past doesnt mean you have to be beholden to it
 If you
 You dont owe your past shit If I dont
feel anything about my past but I still remember
it and I still dont give a fuck about where I
came from then why should you care about shit
that you dont even remember
 Molly you seem like you have a pretty
solidified identity for someone who has only had
consciousness for two years
 Things came back quick do you feel like
theres still remnants of whoever you once were that
have informed who you are now
 Interesting
 I can kind of agree with that Cheers to
bullshit
 Dont believe him Jester
 You ever think you could actually be
doing damage though Setting people on false paths
 Some people are vulnerable and looking
for answers
 Come on Patterson come on Help us out
here right now This is your day job
 Did you ever know anyone who did used to
try and set people on wrong paths with their
fortune telling
 No
 Still in the Zone of Truth now
 Well this was fun
 For what its worth I like you a little
better now
 You dont have to reciprocate it
 I get that a lot
 Oh yeah Fjord and I found out that were
probably going to be facing some undead wispy
things that might electrocute us
 Okay Do you know how to fight them

 Eventually
 Full Winklevoss twins
 Youre feeling guilty for calling him
rockface but not for telling him to eat shit I
like that Thats great
 Drinking a drink with cold ice
 We were looking for a collapse A change
in texture
 This is it
 They said that the glowing orbs that made
the men collapse were purple
 Thats a nice sconce
 Im always a fan of going down
 What
 Ill take up the rears
 I have no chill You talk to me two
minutes later
 I dont think so
 Rogue shit
 Ball bearings you stole from me
 Definitely a puzzle
 I feel like this is going well
 Ill hold up the back I want to look
around and see if I see anything that looks of value
 Ill take that natural one and give
another  to LA
 Wait up for me
 Miss
 I want to catch it
 Knowing its coming
 d plus eight
  Wait how many
 
 I caught it Argh
 Those are from earlier
 Its this thing
 Oh shit
 Look how cool
 Yeah
 You said this was pretty big
 Can I do a check to see if I recognize
any of these things
 I can use my mystical erudition to spend
a ki point
 I get advantage on this
 
 Cool
 Yeah its like magic people code
 The people I learned from were super into
this shit
 I think its a puzzle I feel like this
thing rotates and we have to match the symbols on
the bottom to the symbols that match the school of
magic It feels like the divination is a full
symbol of the star
 Evocation right Then the diamond
 What would the diamond be
 I bet theres a key
 Im going to start looking around
digging seeing if I see anything that looks like
it would fit the shape Im also going to shout
about an octagonal room where they got attacked
 Maybe weve got to go all the way back up
to the top
 The spiral staircase
 We need a down here team and an up here
team and maybe a Frumpkin to communicate through
 That looks like it would fit in the rod
 Okay
 Okay 
 You work so fast
 The stairs are back through the hall and
up right Theyre not in these chambers Its one
big chamber
 All right Ill jog up the stairs
 Oh sorry
 Get it girl
girl get it get it girl
  To the front to the side to
the back Disarm that trap
 Hey can I keep that I think I can throw
it later
 Thank you Thanks Nott
 Oh sorry heres your thumb back I just
want the bolt
 Yeah whos going up
 I have a feeling theres going to be a
levery or a movey situation
 Yeah you might need opposable thumbs
 Sorry
 Ill take the front
 Any ghosty globbies
 Natural 
 Okay
 On the ground
 Okay Are they like profiles or are they
front
 Looking up deadless Okay Copy
 Sorry Absorbing a lot at once Keep
going
 I relay all of that of course
 I do
 And we can see it sorry
 We can see a closer of the dome with the
symbols on them
 Oh were not there yet Sorry Were
just up the spiral staircase
 Im assuming its through the collapsed
tunnel Right Okay Got it
 That feels like that might be a trap
 Ooh All of them
 Here we go
 I would be probably be in between Fjord
and Caleb
 
 Little shits
 They what
 Is that true
 Copy
 Nein Miss
 Okay You want to go first girl
  didnt Did you try to shoot it
 Okay seeing Nott have a hard time Im
going to pull out that holy water and Im going
to like a confetti popper I want to right over
its face just break it
 Yeah
 Just straight attack
 With my dex to throw it even though Im
not throwing it
 Im not throwingthe holy water Im
trying to break it with my hand and palm in its face
 
 Is it a dex saving throw
 Okay Do I still get my bonus attack
 Natural  
 Eight damage
 Do I punch a ghost
 Okay
 A little cold
 Yep
 Does that mean I get to make an
opportunity strike against it
 Thats okay thats okay
 
 Another eight points
 Yeah go
 Nice Thats what we do
 I know I dont feel so bad for making
fun of them now I feel like maybe we were hard on
them but now I dont think we were
 Okay we can keep going
 For the boatman
 Holy shit thats awesome
 Beau hollers out
 Hey I think you
figured out that puzzle
 Let it fall
 Whenever we get done with the short rest
can Beau start peeking through and digging away at
the collapsed entrance into that tunnel
 It wasnt good Six Slow going
 Was there a little crawl space at the top
that we could crawl through
 Well Its just me and I rolled shitty
 The ceiling is through here and its
blocked by a bunch of rubble We can try and dig
through it if we think something should be up
there
 All right
 Ive been like small boulders Ive been

 If the thing goes two clicks correct
it goes there
 So wait divination evocation
necromancy
 And elemental things right Isnt
evocation
 Fire lightning elemental things
 Something bad might happen once we turn
this so be on guard
 Im going to join Molly I think someone
needs to be upstairs You guys stay
 Yeah
 I got you one better Ill shove in my
staff and push against the pillar and use it as
leverage see if I can pry it open
 Ooh natural  
 You see this is like a simple sorry
its like a simple tool Sorry I drooled a little
 What
 You know what Thats fair Ill take
that That was a good one
 It was a good jab
 We heard you
 Wait but you did necromantic right
 Maybe its a trial maybe we have to
fight all of them
 Im going to use my boots at this point
  to 
 Negative no
 Sentinel bitches
 They suck you up
 Its bad
 I dont know
 We attack at advantage For how long
 Is it concentration
 Dont break that concentration
 Jello
 Do we just slap jello
 Im going to do a fullon
 Yeah doing a fullon jello shot
 Thats good thats an  Plus six so

 Seven plus four 
 No
 Okay Ill go for the  in case I roll
a natural  I did not roll a natural 
 Does it feel like I did some damage
 Okay Ill take my bonus and whack Or
you know what Yeah Im going to whack it
 Thats good Thats 
 Six damage
 Its like that pins and needles thing
 Yeah like dead arm Its a little
dead
 Wheres Yasha
 Can I go around near Frumpkin and flank
it
 Thats good Thats fine
 And I hit it with Sentinel
 I rolled a 
 Six damage
 Yeah These are all my unarmed strikes
yeah
 I hate that feeling
 Yeah
 What was it like  points of damage you
did in one round
 Yeah that was great
 Did any of that trigger my sentinel
 It didnt move out of my range at all
 It got a natural 
 And that I wouldnt have Okay I
already got my one reaction
 I feel like that was before though the
one reaction
 The first one With it being one more
round do I have a reaction
 Its me and Yasha
 I did on the round before I feel like I
have one more round but I dont think I did Did
you though Because it moved out of your range
 But did Yasha
 Oh she ran out of range Okay
 I was thinking there was another round in
between that Im going to lay into it
 Wait Wait
 Caleb you already went Youre going to
give it to her Okay Then Ill lay into it
 Sorry I wanted to make sure someone was
going to get Jester out
 
 Thats nine points of damage
 Im going to go ahead and do Flurry of
Blows for these next two Thats a natural 
 So five points of damage The second one
Thats not great Thats 
 Great and thats seven points of damage
 Aw Frumpkin Hey buddy
 Well if you hit all with everything at
once then the worst that can happen is that we
have to fight two more things at the same time
LIAM Well Jester did necrotic and I can
obviously handle well I can handle evocation or
 So we have to do it all at once
 Beau takes off her belt
 I take off my belt and I hold it up like
a rally car racer girl

 Three two one 
 Come on
 I still have this holy water too
 Which ones Which portions
 Yes
 And enchantment
 We put bowls no
 All right yes
 Me and Fjord will stand by in case
anything else drops out of the ceiling
 Yasha you want to take another point
Fighters and casters
 This was a research facility for mages
Theyre super uppity about this shit yeah
 I pull off the belt again
 One two three
 On the other side
 Beaus left behind going
 Come on Pick
it up Caleb
 Jester you should always look out for
yourself first all right
 I am waiting behind motherfucker
 I am inbetween you and them and Im
 Caleb I love you but we are missing out
on other shit Im having extreme FOMO right now
Come on
 No more ten minutes
 Im definitely going to write it down
 Its the sword Its the fucking sword
 Yeah from ashes shall rise again Are
we going to fight some guy whos going to chop off
our legs
 It talked about chopping off our legs
 Yeah the trophy was a warning He lost
his legs
 I tried to write as much as I could
 Maybe we should run
 I was going to say I dont think weve
achieved anything
 He wanted us to bring back any type of
ancient research that we could find
 But we could keep any of the spoils
 He said he wants to tell us secrets or
something I like secrets
 Yeah Secrets make friends
 For trade what does that mean
 Nine
 Tell me something cool
 Im sorry boo Its not good an 
 No sorry ten
 Fuck you Genghis Khan
 Eight
 This is all the notes from what we
learned about Siff Duthar
 I think he is a being of fire and ice so
I bet hes immune to fire and ice
 Natural one
 Stunned
 What can I do
 Im going to be like
 The fire and ice
from the book and the lost sword and all that
shit remember
 Yeah
 Yes Sentinel
 Okay Im going to Im good right Im
going to run up and pull out that holy water that
I didnt use before Im going to parkour off of
Yashas shoulder and spike it right at his feet
 Okay I dont know if thats good 
 Eight
 Okay I still have my opportunity attack
I mean my Sorry my secondary attack
 I did move up I said I ran up next to
Yasha and spiked it I parkoured off her
shoulders spiked it
 I want to do flurry of blows
  and  to hit
 That is an additional six Sorry 
damage
 Okay thats fair
 I bet he wants his sword back
 Dont fuck me Gil
 Ow five
 Yeah ghostslayer
 That guy knew way too much about
everything
 Lost them
 Yasha can though
 Wait Maybe if we show it the sword
hell chill out
 Wheres that corkscrew thing
 Thats better 
 Wait we have the book that we found in
the research center
 It says From ashes I shall rise
again
 I cant get a reaction from it as it
goes
 Fuck Im going to run over to this
bookcase and put my staff behind it to see if I
can knock it over
 Fuck That keeps happening Six
 I guess so
 Can I give her some assistance
 Smoke grenade Thats awesome
 Mushroom cloud that was great
 Ive got a little bit of oil
 Ill give you a little bit of a
therapeutic temple rub while Im at it
 What is that  
 Are you counting Ash
 Ive never seen so many people happy for
a natural one
 Bring the art out too
 Theyre like We didnt anticipate
this
 Rich people love fancy art
 Yeah
 While all of this is going on Beau wants
to be going through some of these books that were
on the shelf that we knocked over
 Im going to do a tour of the urns and
see if theres anything jewelry or something
hidden in there
 
 Can I do a little flip through of it
 Can I use a ki point to get advantage
 Ill mark that down really quick Ill
take that  over that two 
 They tried to burn it
 I walk over to Caleb Hey Caleb Found
this
 Sure I think its got stuff for you in
it
 Thats unfortunate actually
 Sure
 Covered in oil and ash
 Youve got like a section to take notes
now
 Necromancers
 But a great sword
 Took his legs yeah
 Thats why he had no feetsies
 He actually didnt have feet He lost his
legs
 Hmm I dont know
 Yeah Yeah
 Give me a damn ring
 Beau leans over Calebs shoulder What
are you reading
 Yeah thats cool Whos the publisher
Is that first print First edition
 I recognize a few of those symbols
 You know magic shit
 The Gentleman just wanted us to kill
shit right
 He wanted us to Did you find it
 Did he want us to bring back something
Or just clear it out
 I thought he said he wanted us to bring
the expensive good shit but we can keep whatever else
 Maybe some of the art
 They love old things If we say it
belonged to a dead person they love it even more
 Well each take a ring
 Well each take one ring
 Maybe we can give him that research
notebook we found You keep the spellbook we give
him the research notebook We already know what
was in it
 I say we keep the sword
 Do we have to go back out through the
river to get out of here
 Which means were going to have to pass
right back through The Gentlemans place Its not
like were going to be able to lie
 I wonder where it goes
 What do we remember about the Crawling
King Do you know anything
 Did you say you rolled a one
 You rolled a one another one
 Well I think this information about the
teleportationy circle situation could be useful
leverage if he wants to try and take that sword
off of your back
 I say we keep this teleportation a
secret unless he tries to start bargaining for shit
 Not unless he asks
 Thats what were saying
 How did you forget we got that
 I have one I think
 We have mushrooms
 Well its eight cubic square feet
 Yeah its magical
 I still like Yashas idea
 Just slip it up your back robe
 All right lets go
 They worship some weird shit Who knows
what dark corners of the world it goes to
 Were going to start with just trying to
give him the rings and the art right Rings art
shit Keep everything else
 We could do a scout boat
 Maybe one boat stays behind the other
scouts it out
 Ill check it out
 Its our boat Our boat scouts
 I use my staff to help navigate
Jester
 I light a torch
 Were back to the fork
 Were going down that other path right
 Can I get a little bit closer I can
poke
 Im going to take my staff and jab it
behind there see if theres anything
 Theres always shit behind waterfalls I
think we should
 Can I help her push off
 Will it go anywhere though This is the
end of it Its stuck in the chamber
 Ugh Gross Molly
 You know people are going to start
 How easy is it to get back down here
though
 He is very wet
 Explain that joke Explain it
 The research journal The research one
 What was it written in
 Caleb if youre done with that book do
you think I could hold on to it
 Yeah Id love to Thank you
  More bad dreams
 Crack into a Kraken
 I do a few push ups to get warmed up
 Yeah some squats
 Its true You need more than one
example
 Got to find that average
 Like a satyr Like in those ancient Greek
paintings
 Oh big tusks
 Does he have a cool lip tattoo
 Couldnt afford a root canal
 My childhood damage Insight check
 I hate it when that happens
 
 Its nine Its 
 Children are assholes
 I mean its how we see you
 Yeah I mean were too distracted with
our own personal damage
 Then we bribe him with the information on
the teleportation circle
 Sure
 Yeah
 Oh shit
 She did rowing yesterday
 
 Oh shit
 So many undead blobs Lot of undead
blobs
 The boss is still asleep you said
 All right Lets go be blindfolded
 Thats pretty bad
 By the scruff
 Bacon I want bacon
 Theres like ash all over the place now
Sorry about that
 Found lots of skeletons along the way
 We also found a decent amount of fine art
for you
 Come on Jester
 There wasnt a lot left
 Oh There was this floor with this relief
in it of these two faces and Fjord put some coins
in it It opened up and he collapsed and fell in a
pit It was super fun
 No we stayed up all night trying to get
back here
 Theres just no answer further
 You knew going in here it was heavily
looted and raided We brought you several pieces
  Caleb we talked about this
 All right man Been in the business
longer than we have I toss him the research notebook
 Heres the precious research you were
looking for
 Youre welcome
 Yes
 Fuck Who just me Can he help me
 Natural  Thank you Yeah
Motherfucking liars
 Come on Theres been one too many
seeminglys
 Will we get confirmation word from you
that the deed has been done
 I take the leftover bacon strips and I
shove them in my pocket
 I give half of my bacon to Caleb Here
you go
 That was awesome
 We have those chains We could
 We found a dead guy In chains
 Do you think that people are going to
start being suspicious of us if we keep selling
magical manacles
 The same blacksmith
 Let him know that Horris is out of town
 Several dead people
 Especially Molly and I
 As were walking I lean over to Fjord
Gentleman said that it was Ulog that arranged and
leaked the information to the Xhorhasian
assassins What would be his motive for doing
that if he only really cared about getting his
wife free Or at least revenge for his wife
 I hope so Feels like a big task for one
person How would he have those connections
 Yeah
 We could enter in a contest and fight for
the Harvest Festival right
 Yeah Maybe theres prize money or
something
 I like fighting people for fun
 Yeah thats it
  Hide your kids Hide your
wife
 Hey
 Where do we sign up for the Victory Pit
 Tell me You know

 Ive got such cottonmouth
 Mmm What happens if you have a
childhood but its barely a childhood because it
was supposed to be someone elses childhood but
it was you instead Is that a childhood
 Is that why I have cotton mouth Ah
goddamn it
 Well I saw this goatman and he told me
just dont eat the yellow snow and youd be okay

 I tell her about the Xhorhasian spies and
the terrorist that we encountered Does she seem
like she knew that knowledge or not
 They said they were looking for an
artifact Something that the wizards here had
stolen Something that they said furthered their
bloodline and made sure that they furthered their
population I dont know Do you know anything
about it
 Why else would they attack the tower if
they werent looking for something specific
 I never said I show pity I wanted to
know what the hell this artifact was that they
were after Figured you here at the Cobalt Soul
would know
 We wouldnt have any records on some
Xhorhasian artifact that apparently keeps them alive
 All right
 All right Thank you Dairon

 I liked how the archer was walking around
ready all the time maybe we should do that

such a mutual fan of yours
 Beautiful
 Cobalt Souls got your back too
 Rexxentrum Soltryce Academy
 Oh my god hes got a weakness
 Lets remember this for later
 Man Yashas super honest
 Super forthcoming
 I dont think so
 You definitely made it seem like she
could be a Xhorhasian spy definitely there to
potentially kill them In fact I think thats
exactly what they thought might have been
happening
 Yeah it was kind of great
 I think theyre going to look at you as a
good resource I think thats what you revealed
yourself as
 What the fuck is the Kryn though
 Oh the Kryn
 I was envisioning a big evil monster
 Have you seen the dark skies
 I think Mollys right I think Molly and
Nott are right I think theyre going to try and
start enlisting soldiers here Are they doing the
same where youre from
 Where do we go
 Yes
 I drink all the leftover drinks that
people left behind
 No Im just finishing the ones that are
left behind It is an atrocity to leave alcohol on
a table
 
 Probably
 Youre a You
 See thats even shiftier
 We have fucking money to burn
 Oh my god Im so tired
 Pillow Trove
 Were at a break
 And thank you Paul for getting us all
ice cream
 Yeah I told you a fucking secret though
I also kind of told Yasha the secret You and
Yasha know the secret
 Its not really that much of a secret
 Yeah As long as nothing crazy happens
Im assuming
 I know I know exactly what you want to
do Yeah should be all right
 What are you looking for just more
spells Or anything else in particular
 Okay
 Theyre not going to let you see the
super secretive weird shit in the back
 Yeah theres tons of history man They
forced history down my throat
 Hey wait though
 I know Real good at it Why are you
afraid of fire
 Im just saying I just want to know
because Im going to be taking you around books
and your relationship with fire is you know
 No are you going to set the books on
fire
 Ill take you in the library if you tell
me why youre afraid of fire
 One secret traded for another Its a
fair price I think
 Do you know where to find me when youre
ready
 Ill take you to the library as soon as I
get my payment Drinks
 Inside the hotel has drinks
 Well its a little unbalanced I have to
choose if Im going to commit to the handle or if
Im going to commit to the cup
 This is not bad
 Shes an Instagram model
 However many can bunk together I guess
 Yeah Heres four more for me
 Bottle service
 Jester does that too
 Lend an ear Give advice Ease your mind
 Just saying thats how it sounded before
too
 Is there like a never mind
 Like the public libraries of today
 Yes I want my pencil set
 It felt like a festival inside your
school
 Support LA Thank you to those who
did
 Thats what I was going to say Wow
 You made an incredibly excellent point
It is so easy to defraud the mail
 Its a lot to send somebody in a birthday
card
 Jester why dont you keep that
 We just kicked ass and made  Well do
it again tomorrow
 Sure The emergency fund
 Sure Yeah
 Is it the four ladies in a room
 I rolled a  plus Oh 
 Man in context that was weird as fuck I

 I poke my head out Do I see Fjord
 Psst
 Youre in the most expensive hotel in 
miles and youre in the hallway Thats real
fucking funny
 You want to come in our room so youre
not in the hall
 I have Nott and Jester and Jester has
pastries
 We could order room service You want to
come in and order room service
 Lets do that We order room service

 How about this
 well tell them to give
us the chefs choice The special
 Oh god Come on lets go
 Were spending enough money on this
place
 Okay
 Can we go order food first Then well go
hit Caleb because its going to be like 
minutes to deliver it
 
 Yeah
 Oh I mean
 No but Im not in favor of many things
I dont like a lot of things Kind of have a
problem with authority and theyre like the
epitome of authority I watched my father
sacrifice a lot to try and impress those people
Im not sure what it was for Seems like a lot
 What How do you mean
 Im not super invested in the
political spectrum I just dont want any part of
it So no I think it could be better No
 No
 Marishas telling you Beau is being
genuine
 I think
 I have no investment in their success or
failure I think most of them tend to be scumbags
who want monetary and influential gain and I
think they treat their poor pretty shitty and they
treat their elite pretty great and I think thats
sucky Yeah I think theyre garbage people but
Molly thinks Im a garbage person
 Sorry a trash person If theyre garbage
people Im their rare cousin the trash person
 Yeah
 Yeah I
 I watched my father sacrifice a lot to
get where he was and Im not sure if it was
fucking worth it So the Empire doesnt lean
favorably in my spectrum But I also dont care if
they really live or die or whatever
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Is the secret that valuable
 Whats young Teenager
 Why didnt you say anything earlier
 When we were talking to Trent You know
we were talking to Trent
 One of the other students
 He made you executioners
 Caleb thats deeply fucked up you know
that right
 Then one day your parents are brought in
as traitors No
 You had to do this to graduate to prove
your loyalty
 Into hearing their talks against the
Empire is that what it was
 Like to run again
 You were just talking with Nott about
running tomorrow
 If I dont let you in
 Caleb Im good at keeping secrets You
heard us talking to Trent You know he wants
Yasha and youre the only person who knows the
atrocities that this man who utterly gave me the
creeps by the way so Im feeling a little bit
validated in the fact that I read him pretty well
 Im just saying you have a
responsibility now
 Keep this guy from hurting more people
 You want to take down Trent Is that why
youre doing all this You want to take down Trent
 Ah What are you hoping to find
 Caleb you dont though No one wants
that amount of power and responsibility
 Dont worry Ill take you to the
selfishly try and go after this guy for your own
vendetta or you can use your motives to keep
others from getting hurt in a very similar way
 All right I know you just make dancing
lights or at least you can feel like you just
make dancing lights but those dancing lights
make sure I can punch people in the fucking face
whenever I cant see shit A little bit of
teamwork goes a long way
 Cool man cool Kick me out of the room
I get it Yep all right
 No I mean you just dumped some
heavyass shit like that and then ask me to leave
No I get it its fine
 All right Ill leave
 No
 Ill keep your secret Well keep all
this a secret I dont think its anything to be
ashamed of though
 Well figure it out in time

yourself
 You seem to hate your kind quite a lot I
dont know
 Yeah we can Yeah hey

 Nott there are bad people everywhere
 Doesnt mean you have to associate
yourself with them

island of misfits

 A little His ears are getting a little
pink
 Ill helm
 Sorry 
 Moving
 What does the weather look like Are
there clouds in the sky
 It looks like the landscape is going
dark Not something moved in front of it or like
something is moving
 Whos got good eyes and knows about
clouds and shit
 Does that look natural to you
 If we move though we have to move fast
and maybe a little bit carefully
 All right
 Can I go ahead a little bit and see if I
find any hidden paths that might cut through this
field off the main road Scout ahead a little
bit
 I have ball bearings
 I rolled a 
 How far away is the army
 Okay Im going to come over and be like

I think we should hide and wait until these guys
pass with this being the situation
 Are we going to get questioned
 Nott you should hide
 I agree whats our story
 Were just traveling hired hands We are
going to go to the swamp and look for yard work
 Maybe they can help us fix our wheel
 Good day
 The Labenda Swamp
 You included the horse
 Have you seen the frontline before
 Its fitting that the Traveler helps fix
a wheel
 Its very poetic
 I like it
 She did just lift up the carriage
 Hey Fjord have you had any more weird
dreams
 Are your dreams affected by the weather
Like if its cold do you throw up ice shards
instead of salt water or something
 Because that can be cool
 Okay
 We dont know if its seawater though
right It could be like saline
 Maybe thats your problem this whole
time
 Are we exposed Like out
 Can we all huddle under the
 I mean 
 Full tauntaun style
 Soaking
 I was curious of that too
 How close are we to the Xhorhasian
border
 Oh theres Druvenlode Theres Max Load
 I mean if he was taking the Leonardo da
Vinci approach then it could be accurate Max of Lode
 Im going to get on the cart and try and
put my cloak over me
 I look at Molly underneath me on the cart
and I fart a little bit Just a little
 Sorry
 Oh shit

 That would be fucked up if you used that
as your exit Wait where what do you mean
Ashley left

was told

 Attach it to the back of the horse Go
 Yeah
 Yeah how do you mean
 You need more incense
 What kind of a shelter
 Like a dome like a bubble dome How do
you mean
 Beau does pushups while waiting for
Molly
 Ill be in the cart
 Im okay at surviving
 Im going to take my staff and poke it in
the marshy bits
 It sounded like an alert to me
 
 Maybe its a mating call
 Does it sound like multiple or from the
same source
 Is this considered the Berleben path
 The Bromkiln So this is not
 Does there appear to be any sign of
wreckage or anything else that looks like it
might not have made its way through this path
because of other dangers
  but that was a bit ago
 Thats not as good this time 
 Nobody move
 If youre going to move move onto the
cart
 Are we on horses
 Something just moved in the water It
might be able to hear our movements though
 It moved away though
 I take a ball bearing out and toss it and
throw it into the swamp See what happens
 Hes probably going to die Oh man poor
guy Hell be fine
 Would we know if this is the stretch of
road that they were talking about that they were
having issues with
 What are we saving
 Im still on a horse yeah Im on a
horse
 Yeah Im staying on my horse
  How cool is that
 The thing that weve been hauling
around
 You have to stare at it for a minute
 For the next eight hours

gator is super stoked about having this lollipop
 
 This is so prehistoric
 Were the brigade

slimy undead trolllike guy

 How long have you lived here
 We wanted to move faster
 Thank you Youre so complimentary It
makes me a little nauseous

important I was and it made me feel nice so I try

Damali but I didnt spend a lot of time there I
lived on the streets on my own and then I was
taken in by some people
 Really
 Youre an excultist
 They worshiped you
important to them somehow
 Were on rough terrain right now
 But where he is it would be considered
rough terrain
 We can try to send someone ahead as bait
lure him out fight him on steady ground
 He had green pusy ooze pouring out of
holes in his face Just want to throw that out there
 I got undead vibes from this guy
 He definitely had like a collarbone just
hanging out
 Thats what I literally just said
 He probably is hearing everything were
talking about

viewership and your subscription But did you know
that if you have an Amazon Prime account you can
get a free subscription to a single Twitch channel
of your choice In fact you might even have an
Amazon Prime account and not even know it Its a
proven fact that five out of five Amazon Prime
account users have Amazon Prime because they simply 
forgot to cancel their day free trial So put that
free twoday shipping to use and subscribe to Geek
 Sundry But remember you have to resubscribe
each month to your Twitch channel of choice which
is kind of irritating But you know its
ultimately not our design So give Geek  Sundry a
sub because you know we did shoot this fake PSA

 Are you trying to look for all six of
them
works in shadows they keep themselves really
secretive I wasnt allowed outside of our temple
where I was raised They gave me everything I
wanted but I wasnt allowed outside so I guess I
can be a bit naive about a few things
 Maybe they want the safe house for
themselves
 Do I see anything like landmarks or
anything out of place surrounding the tree
 Its all right 
 Its just one little ribbon
 Im going to see if I can climb the tree
and get to it
 Sometimes we call her Nott Bren Yeah

 Okay thats nine plus
 Ooh 
 The second one knowing Im going to get

 Damn it
 Okay 
 Plus seven plus ten total
 Im going to do flurry of blows
 Flurry of Beaus
 Thats not great 
 Second one is even fucking worse Its a
two
 Can I assist for advantage
 Im going to take my staff and try the
same thing
 Is she all right
 Hey Cali
 Oh it does magnet It does actually
magnet
 People are going to suspect things of us
Trading in manacles all the time These didnt work
 You have luck Oh it was the
 Youre so mean
 So Cali I started a conversation
earlier
 Which might be why you got so distracted
You seem to have such an affinity for cute things
Is there a reason why you like cute things Im
not saying that not all of us like cute things We
all love cute things but you seem to really like
cute things
where and shes doing this as shes going
through the crates I was a kid and I used to ask
for dolls and pets and stuff when I was growing up
and the cult used to give them to me Serissa used
to give them to me I dont know Theres a lot of
bad stuff in the world and its nice to appreciate
nice things sometimes I like having and finding
cute stuff Do you not like that
 I just might appreciate some other
things
 Man thank you
it was here I traced it I followed them I knew
that it was coming through this Maybe I missed
it Maybe Ive messed up
 Maybe its in the next room Theres still
another room
 Its true Could be a whole network of
caverns
 Until we find
 We do have boom boom sticks
 Or like you said we just destroy the
entrance to where they cant come through
 It takes time and equipment
 I could probably join you for a swim
and if there is a room back there I need to make
sure its not here
 If you want to just swim and back Youre
going to swim and come back
 As if I didnt know that coming here
Thats the worst thing anyone has said about us
 Our job was to secure the safehouse We
can collapse this and say job done
 That changes things
 Maybe run a line Have the rope in case
 What
 Calebs still holding the bowl
 Can I snatch it out of his hand real
quick
 Just a straight dex check
 Its not great
 Ten
 Im playing a game of keepaway
  Caleb
 Caleb I respect you and all of your
intentions but your caution does not get to
control other peoples destinies
 You had no intentions of wanting this
bowl or needing this bowl or caring about this
bowl until Cali came around
 I grab Caleb drag him aside hand Cali
the bowl drag Caleb over to a private corner and
I say look We all have our fucking trauma You
understand that We all have our fucking garbage
and our dirt and our shit But you dont get to
use your skeletons in your closet your PTSD to
be shitty and control other people and what they
want It does not make you the authority on whats
right and whats wrong Just because you think
that youre a shitty person guess what Were all
fucking shitty people
 I get feeling like shitty people I dont
speak for the rest of these guys but I get
feeling shitty But it doesnt mean that you get
to impress that on other people and make them feel
like shitheads just because you are
 Then she fucking lied to us We take
that and we learn that as a lesson for later on
 Yes Cali
seen Mr Caleb is the only one who really
understands how powerful this thing is Even I
didnt know as much I appreciate everything that
youve just said and its the nicest thing that
anyones ever done for me Please dont blame him
He was doing the right thing
 Im not blaming him Its just that this
isnt the first occurrence of something like this
with him either
 I think he is too
 Its kind of what Molly said
 The road to hell is paved with good
intentions
 Thats fair

 Youre being facetious arent you
 I probably got a little too aggressive

a little too angry Thats not necessarily my good
side you know dont like people seeing that
 That Im not good at apologies
 I got a little too aggressive
 And I have a bad side
 And I shouldnt have done it

thing is like a beacon to him
 Maybe youre cursed
 Its a trauma film no
 Sounds a lot like dying
 A coup
 Well might be sooner rather than later
now
 The pool water is salt water
 I kind of agree with that
 Well this is all from what I can
recognize deities that are not sanctioned by the
empire
 I mean things that are wanted that are
illegal are going to be wanted It seems like
there was clearly a high demand for some people to
worship who they want to
 Maybe they were gathering a bunch of
these items because they were looking for the
exact one for this one
 Any dope bos
 Bo staff
 No I have a staff
 Can I assist him on that
 You have assistance Roll with
advantage

 Thats pretty thats a good point
 When
 Yeah hes a good guy
 And you think you do
 Thats true
 Hupperdook
 The job that I had before I met up with
you guys in Zadash information passes through
You hear things
 I worked at a library the Cobalt Soul
library
 It is a faction of monks
 No I hope not I think it differs from
day to day depending on what Im doing Do you
think Im a bad guy
 Thats all that matters right
 That has to do with the job that I had
before the job that I had
 Yeah
 Yeah theres definitely something
missing right
 Lets catch up with the others while we
walk and talk
 My dad was super protective and I was an
asshole and rebelled a lot
 Yeah You know so when interesting and
different people would pass through my hometown I
started making some connections started getting
involved in some mainly illegal trading
 I got in really big trouble from my
parents because I started syphoning his cases of
wine and selling them underground for half the
cost without tariffs
 Yes I was
 Yeah On top of other things that was
like my big denouement you know I dont know I
just grew to hate the town that I was in and the
system that my father was a part of
and so everything
 He wasnt a bad person I think he just
had bad direction I dont know he couldve been
a good dad He was a shitty dad and a good
businessman
 Yeah
 Yeah kind of
 One day he found out about what I was
doing after Id already gotten in trouble for you
know a little bit of mild extortion and a little
bit of trading little bit of trafficking So I
think he was already pretty irritated with me
Then he found out about my smuggling scheme with
his wine One day he called me down into the
living room and there was a whole group of monks
and people in black I tried to fight them off and
they grabbed me and they drug me away
 My dad paid to get me abducted by monks
yeah
 He wasnt very proud
 Sure Great
 Yeah I mean there were elements that
were hard but everyone has had hardships right
Whats it matter Besides he sent me off to the
monks I think he was hoping that they were going
to beat my indiscretions out of me Instead I
think all of the things that my father saw in me
that he hated the monks saw as a potential
advantage So in a weird way I think it mightve
been the nicest thing he ever did for me
 I mean I still never really want to see
him again and I dont think he wants to see me
again either In fact he told that he didnt
want to see me again So its good Yeah
 But I do have a nice little wineskin
that I keep reserved of my familys wine
if you want to taste
 I toss Nott the wine
 Anybody else wants a sip of my heritage
 Scones are hard to make
 Happy Fathers Day
 You guys know that dancing is about
spontaneity and you are planning this dance like

wands

it around your Wand of Smiles Now you have a
ribbon dancer of smiles

that We just got fucking 
 All two gold
 All right guys heres the deal
 No fuck Im so angry Fuck
 Yeah we put our winnings we split it
up and threw it in the pack
 I also dont think this was necessarily a
oneperson job Normally theres a couple people
doing stuff like that or one person is a runner
and one person is a looker
 Do you remember what my bag looked like
It matches my sash that you still have on your wand
 I almost forgot we tied that on That was
funny Man we were drunk

 Fuck
 Lets see if we can get some tips and
thats something later
 Thats not a bad idea
 With what fucking money Molly
 Yeah in a few ways
 Do you know anyone where thats their
little side hobby
 Is she lying to me Does she know more

 Is there a thieves guild
 Is this a goblin thing
 What was your question
 Wow that was a layer of questions
 What is it charisma saving throw 
 I like you a lot Heres the deal

 Has there been a raise in criminal
activity Is there something in the town that
would start provoking people to want to pickpocket
more Is the rise in the war effort bringing
people down Theres got to be some reason
 They do have our drink tokens That was
in the bag
 I wouldnt come back the next night if it
were me I would want to make sure that we were gone
 But I think that could be a better
target for your lost object spell
Thats what I was thinking
 Yeah its a prize Its a reminder of
your good job
 Hang on Irena
 Do you have any new staff members
 You mentioned being able to get us
friends and other type of services Where do you
find those resources
 Whats her name
 I dont think you did any of that at all
I just think you might know who did Even if you
dont consciously know I think you have an idea
 If I wanted to go hock some stolen goods
where would I go
 Who What the Fitz and that guy
 Its a repeating crossbow
 How do they remind you
 Plus we would love to pay for your
crossbow but were currently light
 Wait who wandered in here before
 And just while were talking you
wouldnt happen to know of any criminal
undergrounds thieves guilds pickpocketers
people of the night
 Roamers of shadows
 I threw mine at a troll
 Subcontractor work isnt too bad of a
living
 As we leave I grab the bolt that he shot
into the wall over Calebs head
 As we walk over there I say
 Hey
Rissa
 You got a good dad He really loves you
 Sometimes family names arent all that
theyre cracked up to be
 Whats more important is that he really
cares for you Dont take that for granted all
right And I slap her on the back and keep
walking
 I was going to say me and Jester hold
hands and we skip off
 We talk in here or are we going to take
them outside
 I look back at the boys and I say
 Sit
the fuck down
 Heres the deal This guys super fucking
charming Hes going to talk to you first You
dont want to talk to me
 Deal
 My man Fjord is up
 I crack my knuckles intimidate them a
bit from behind
 I pull out my staff Do a cool little
flourish
 I take a few steps forward
 Oh Jesus Its not really my strong
suit
 Oh thats not too bad 
 Okay
 God my staff is just vibrating
 I dont know about this Fjord
 You know in this case I would weigh
between your livelihood and your life Cant have
one without the other
 I crack my staff on the floor and I say

Get fucking moving then
 Yeah
 Blemmy might know the girl
 Did you lick it
 Through the residential district
 I think its the best way to go
 He totally fucking did
 No it was the guy with the nasty fucking
beard
 Duncan That was his name Right the guy
that you drank across
 Wait was Duncan the nerdy guy
 Is there a roof to this thing
 I parkour on the roof
 Ooh 
 Are there any chimneys Soft spots in the
floor Skylights
 Im going to peek in Can I see down
  Okay 
 Goggles
 What do they look like
 Okay Theyre just huddled together you
said
  Four individuals Huddled
around Theyre either the assholes or hostages
its hard to say
 Hey Im going to
 Im going to very gingerly lean over the
 On the boom
 Im going to go back over to the chimney
very gingerly pull out one of the firecrackers
one of the bottle rockets light it with the
tinderbox and drop it in
 Is the chimney wide enough for me to fit
in Santa Clausstyle
 You guys are at the front
 Fuck
 
  Sorry wrong pipe Keep
going
  As I cough my way down the
chimney Im coming
 Im a little late and I look at the girl
 Sorry
 Look because you were so good at your
job keep this I hand him  gold Look I
appreciate good work when I see it all right You
got our shit That was pretty damn good
 Is there anywhere they take kids Kids
separated from their parents Or do they just not care
 So youre just avoiding them
 And we start a childrens band
 Yes exactly
 But its still another three or four
days
 But insight check has become such a
thing
 Of course theyre bullshit theyre
fucking cards
 From Hupperdook
 Hang on This thing has been a problem
for years the clockwork warden Why dont we just
go finish our stuff we have to cross back
through here anyway
 And come back and finish the job
 Of course I do Theyve been scrappy for
long enough They can be scrappy for another week
or two
 I mean Notts over here trying to pull
my heart strings but it seems like you should be
the target You have a thing with kids and
orphanages
 Separated from dad
 You know Im interested if theres a
master lever to this prison Just prison break
see what happens
 All right if we do this I think we need
to give ourselves a hard time limit that we all
stick to because the last thing that I want is
for the fucking Gentlemen with his vials of our
DNA coming after our asses
 I have a feeling The Gentleman isnt a
guy that negotiates on time periods
 I guess it doesnt hurt to ask The
Gentleman if worst comes to worst
 They have  gold on them
 Caleb how long does your string theory
work
 What time is it
 And Yasha
 Oh thats true
 Thats true Sorry Forgot what time it
was
 Hey Kiri show them your music box
 Hes going to make some protection
 Such a good game
 That was funsies
 We got the money back
 Oh my god
 Yo you can buy it or you can collect all
 pinecones and then you just unlock it Its
like that
 Yeah plan
 
 Where are we now Are we still in the
butcher
 Is Rissa still there
 Rissa Sorry Okay
 We were talking about planning and then
sleeping and then going
 I really would hate for our problem with
them to end up coming and finding the kids My
words arent really here right now you know what
I mean
 Emotionally
 I say we send Rissa to go talk to them
 Thats true Maybe we go back to their
employer
 Yeah lets hold on to it Maybe theres
going to be some sort of emergency situation
 Use node in case of emergency
 This is revenge for any time we havent
let Matt go on an NPC just saying
 Wait are Fjord and Jester going to go
call off the employers
 I would just hate for them to find the
kids and then do something to the kids
 I mean we put Calebs Alarm across it
but still
 Exactly I dont know
 Can you do it to the kids
 Yeah
 Man that solves that problem
 We dont need help
 We saw boltthrowers those giant
boltthrowers Like Lord of the Ringsstyle
Siege towers Also Lord of the Ringsstyle
 Battering ram like every fantasy
moviestyle but definitely Lord of the Rings and
the huge cannons
 Pirates
 Thats what we saw last or thats what
I think I saw when we did a perception check or
something
 Uhhuh
 Firemark
 What Blades
 Oh god
 Do the blades spin
 Oh my god
 So wheres the source
 So if we get the source
 Yeah Doesnt sound like a city Id want
to live in
 
 Can we go get suits
 Awesome black suits
 Yeah yeah
 Something with a big lapel Maybe double
breasted Sounds great We would look so handsome
you guys
 Oh
 Would your dad
 Does your dad like pastries Does he have
a sweet tooth
 Does he like pies
 Lets pick up your dad a pie on the way
home
 People like pies right
 Meat pies Would your dad like a meat
pie I just hear people bring pies
 Thank you
 Beau But thats okay Its been a long
emotional day
 Hasnt it Fjord
 Oh man So much its been the longest
day
 We stop and get a meat pie on the way
 One for us one for him Two meat pie
sorry three meat pies
 Can we make that a double
 Thank you
 I throw down for the pies
 Mm
 That was super smart though
 I pass out meat pies to anyone who wants
one but save one
 Taxman
 Are they heading towards the butcher
 It was Rissas idea
 I love that thats what were calling
it
 Spinning death machine
 No she just has hearing
 Yeah
 Oh nosies
 Its a Duracell
 Okay
 These lenses Im assuming theyre
regular lenses I dont know they can still be
blinded right
 So its super cheap and easy to break
Imported Great
 I was going to say if we can get
something to blind it its still just a lens
 Why not something darker Like ash
charcoal black powder
 That is darker
 Actually this brings up a how much
molasses do you have
 Thats so weird Its so abrasive
sometimes
 I feel like molasses would gum up
something thats clockwork right
 Yeah something sticky
 I mean how do we transport it
 Heated tar In a bucket
 Yeah it gets hard Its tar
 Once we get down Once we get down
 He totally just took a thank you for not
his baby being born
 I feel like at break time last time it
came off
 You made it to break I think
 Dont do this to yourself
 When was the last time you left your
house Cleff
 Agoraphobic
 Just us
 Huddle around him okay We perform a
protective
 No not that close Were making a safety
bubble
 Ah I cant nominate Fjord
 Do you believe in me Fjord
 All right tar first
 Is that far from here
 I take my staff out And I go vibrating
ring across the gate
 Good money or trade for some supplies
 I thought were behind a gate like
locked out
 Just sneak in
 And theyre mainly gnomes working this
 Okay So I like as a plan B you
disguising yourself as a gnome worker
 Do it first
 Ill keep watch
 Im keeping watch for any workers who
might be noticing the bucket
 Bravo Bravo
 Nott how close does Mage Hand have to
be
 It was pretty good
 To the prison
 Will it tip over in the bag
 We are a contracted group of workers
working for this man right here Cleff Were here
to take care of the problem that we heard you guys
had with the clockwork warden
 I stole this die that I got you from
forever ago Its got the little d inside of it
Ill take the  for 
 What did you say the wardens name was
 Wardenhelm Poppin
 Drokrusher
 First off
 You dont have to okay
 Yeah Same Rissa same We will not take
up much of your time if you just let us in to go
kill this clockwork warden that this guy made We
heard he was quite a problem Just let us in
well be out of your hair and you can get back to
your work
 Remember this guy
 Why do people keep calling us that
 Look this guy is funding to take care of
the spinning death machine thats in your guys
basement This should be a cityfunded issue but
this guy is being a good noble citizen and
funding it himself so we can come and make a quick
buck and kill your death robot Can we please just
go kill your damn death robot
 You look like a man whos willing to
climb a ladder
 War is a great time for opportunity my
friend
  Highfivesies from across the
table
 Who would
 Whos going to be throwing the tar You
with your Mage Hand maybe
 Yasha and I can try and pin it down
maybe corner it
 Start ripping the plates off
 Lets get to the door heat it up
 Any last tips Cleff
 Thats a good one
 Hamster ball
 I dont know
 To be fair I think we were going to
rest and we decided against it We decided to go
 We know she used two
 Fjords literally the only one that can
charm a guard Unless we bribe a guard
 Do some Suggestion stuff
 Is this the door
 How big is this chamber in here
 Splits in the middle two more sets of
cells on the back side So it looks like a big
fork Does it have a common way Or is this thing
patrolling halls
 Should we heat up the tar
 So he can cast two spells they have to
be at third level
 And his cantrips are So if he casts
Armor of Agathys its going to take up one
of his levels
 And Hex would be another one
 This place is creepy as shit
 Fjords going to cast Armor of Agathys on
himself
 Hope that is a good call What would
Fjord do And Beau puts on her goggles
  Eldritch Blast
 Dear spinning death machine
 Thanks Rissa
  Im going to assume yes Hey
Jester 
  Okay Maybe Pass Without a
Trace Jester 
 Maybe not
 Okay Nevermind Keep going
 Caleb maybe save your shit for
afterwards
 Normally you dont want to get trapped in
a room with something bigger and spinning with
 blades I think wed be better off holding
this choke point
 Im going to move up and go to the
opposite side of where Molly is and peek down the
opposite way just like he did
 You know I like that idea Maybe Yasha
and I can stand and hide and crouch in the corners
while you guys get its attention and shoot it from
range What I would be afraid of is if we were all
in there and it eventually did what it did to
those bars over there and busted in And we were
all sitting ducks on the inside
 It looks like it
 Can I still complete my perception check
and see if I see down here
 Not great Seven
 Is there anything that would warrant a
couple people hiding while some people got in the
thing Is there something that looks like Yasha
and I could maybe hide Im a little disadvantage
looking at this angle
 You could still Mage Hand the tar between
the bars right
 Lets try it
 Thats what Im saying Caleb can you
lift that gate spell if we need to get back out
 Wait are you and Yasha going to be on
the outside
 Neither do I
 Yeah lets do it
 But were going to hide amongst this
rubble on the opposite side and you guys are going to start
 Yeah Can I get up on top of the rubble
and crouch down
 What do you need
 A lot of gold dust
 I know Can we grind some gold really
fast File some
 Quietly file down gold coins
 Scout with the cat Kitty scout
 Im going to stealthily move forward
back where I was across from Molly
 Jesus Christ This just got really
 
 Oh no
 Where is Fjord going Make Fjord go by
the gate maybe Back a bit Then Beau is going to
take out those ball bearings

 Oh youre trying to use my friends
failure to make me feel better
 Its impossible to take you seriously
 And Jester is with you
 No dont do that Go back Sorry keep
going
 I think thats the best thing Ive done
this whole fight is flanking
 Okay Fjord is going to walk up Im a
warlock First hes going to do I dont think
this is a concentration thing its a bonus
action Hes going to do Hexblades Curse

 If he does an attack of opportunity if I
move Fjord back than we get a Sentinel strike right

just used
 
 Should have brought more tar
 You really get tired of this dying thing
I guess unconscious thing
 Dope
 I get 
 Yeah Beau is going to deliriously
still really messed up like a drunk person doing
a pointless task is going to try and scoop up
some ball bearings that she threw and then after
maybe she picks up like ten
 Okay
 
 I tossed my baggie
 My pouch And did one of these things So
Im going to get my pouch back and then
 Okay
 Then after I deliriously tired of
scooping up ball bearings Im going to stumble
back and collapse next to Caleb and also take a
short rest
 Ooh
  I dont know it might be
yours Its hard to tell
  Thats very true Im going to
remember that next time
  Youre the best Fjord
 Your mustache is traveling
 No hes my pillow Fuck you Molly
  Okay
 Beauregard goes
 I just it took a lot
out of us I pass out in Yashas arms
 Yasha
 You have to carry me
 I rolled way better
 You make me feel so warm inside
 How many hit points
 Were The Mighty Nein
 I dont know how long we might be staying
in town so maybe we should go ahead and talk
about that deal while were here
 To get out the Schusters
 Oh But you talked about getting people
out
 Take that  gold consider it their
bail and time served
 And this guy will agree to that Right
Cleff I elbow Cleff
 Total
 Well considering you have a hunk of
metal down in your basement that is worth at least
 gold worth of scrap that Im sure the Assembly
Yard would love to have
 Fjord can foot half since hes
sympathetic
 Hes like No money was spent
 Kids are expensive
 Gilda Wallace
 Why dont we get outside and then well
talk
 Lets just say your kids made an
impression on us
 I was going to say eclectic but sure
 Its like being in Vegas for more than 
hours Youre like No Not again I cant do
this for a third night in a row Ugh
 Oh your way was way more cool
 
 This is making me really emotional
 Kiri 
 A favor In return
 No you were nailing it We did a jinxies
thing yeah
 Fjords right No child should be
separated from their parents Unfortunately this
little one was
 Youve learned
 Shit I turn to Gilda and Wallace and
It would mean a lot if you take her but well
help you out I reach in and I give them  gold
from my stash Should be enough to help for a
little bit Hopefully make up the difference
 Well I stole  gold from my friend
without him being here to speak for it so I feel
like its fair
 Go give Jester a hug I know she wished
shed be here for it
 I give Jester a hug
 You already are Look at this handsome
lot You look like you need to be a vinyl decal on
the back of a minivan
 That might be the first nice thing Ive
ever done
 I dont know what this emotion thing is
Its weird
 It probably isnt
 On the way I look for someone who wasnt
the guy who hated us before selling more of those
poppers because I want to stock up before we get
out of this godforsaken town
 Another set of ten Yeah
 Yeah Caleb
 Oh yeah
 Yeah it wasnt too bad
 Honestly I dont really have a lot of
plans My entire life has been plans being made
for me So its nice not having plans I ran away
from the Cobalt Soul I have ideas I dont know
if ideas would count as plans
 Id be willing to help you under one
condition Can we agree to keep each other straight
 If either one of us tries to turn and do
something stupid or lean a little bit more evil
 Chaotic whatever you want to call it
 Anarchists Lets just make a pact if
either one of us do anything stupid that maybe
were each others failsafes
 I dont think I want to hurt any more
people and I dont think you do either so maybe
if we keep each other from hurting other people
Thats not true I do want to hurt people just
not people I like Lets hurt bad guys
 Can you do the give me a
 Dont know if a lesson was learned here
but all right lets continue on
 Cleff maybe if in the future we come
back and need a repair or something spiffy youll
cut us a deal
 And hey I dont know if you know the
Schusters at all but if you see a family walking
around little bird child maybe watch over them
for us
 I acknowledge that and thank you
 Fuck you Molly
 What time is it
 Yeah To Shitty Creek
 Yes
 If youre deserted on an island to kill
yourself with
 My heart
 They were in a Silence spell
 Better be some dope investigating at the
top when we come back
 Blood Splatter Some CSI shit Up in
here
 Yeah well have dope oneliners
 The Who Its going to be great
 We didnt kill Fjord and Jester though
By puppeting them We took some money but thats
a good cost for not killing them
 That  gold
 So we have the haversack And if they get
disarmed
 Were just selfish
 You sound like it
 Congrats to Laura and Travis
 No its not misery Its beautiful and
amazing and incredible
 The days not over
 For me at least
 Lets move
 I think I have some pocket bacon still
 Yeah Its a little moldy
 Okay
 Wheres Yasha Shes gone too
 Yeah but
 Falchion
 Right but his holster thingy Right
Didnt he have a holster thing or did I just
imagine that because hes Texblade
 Its not right
 Are there trees nearby
 That was very specific for an uh to
come before it
 Can I see if I see any grass thats been
laid down like a direction that there might be
people who have walked through
 Thats a natural one
 First roll in the new studio its a
one
 We know nature is better at everything
 So its impossible to tell if its the
same one
 Well thats more narrow When it was
going on the road was it going towards the
direction we were going or were we following it
 Yeah
 She also has a big old crushie on Fjord
 Why couldnt we hear anything
 Censored video game blood
 And that blood was far away from our
camp Maybe they were just triggered by a sound
that they heard and they went to go investigate
it
 Four D batteries Its very obnoxious
 Im following Molly As I follow Molly I
turn to Nott and Caleb and I say just stay back
for a second Back us up if we need it
 I flank
 Stealth
 Man This feels like last game 
 Yeah do you want Pick a dice bag
 As I make eyecontact Im like Aw
shit Was it the blue Was I too tall
Im assuming Are we going to do this or what
 I would just like a little bit of
feedback so I know how to perfect it later
 Yeah
 Fuck All right
to hide
 Youve got great eyesight
 Im complimenting you
 Whats your name
 Whats your fucking name
 Molly ask her Were at an impasse
 Hows your day

 Sorry Happens sometimes
the Run
 Whats the Run No really whats the
Run That sounds fascinating
 Oh shit We should have thought about
that I dont know your street lingo
 Yeah youre right again
 And by robbed he means half of our
party got abducted Robbed Thats such a light
way of putting it
 We were actually headed to the Run It
does sound pretty cool
  Yeah hey Caleb Nott
 Were a little on edge considering
family I mean party members were abducted
have booze
 Wait I thought you were coming from
Shadycreek Run
 Ah But youve been there
well It aint a nice place Its probably the
least nice place that you could all possibly go
to so
 Its named Shady
 Molly doesnt speak for me I feel like I
can hold my own pretty well

while See as far as we can get maybe we can hide

 Saving throw
 
 Yeah Im not bad Im not one of the bad
guys That you were definitely talking about
That Im aware of right What bad guys are you

 Firbolg
 Amazing
 I say Bad guys kidnapping kids right
Thats scary stuff Trying to protect your son
 Who
 Currently five
 But just call us the Nein The Mighty
Nein
 Here M Nein 
 The Guitaya Clan
 Guai
 Guiatao Clan
 You say hes not your son but part of
your clan
 Is the whole clan wiped out Whos left
 Other half of our party members were
taken from us in the middle of the night just
last night Seems very similar ways considering
neither of the rest of us heard anything
 Yeah
 Nila Shes the one going after them
 What was her sons name
 You couldnt bring a horse back from the
dead could you Just didnt know how far your
abilities stretch
 Water Closets gone forever
 He saved our lives a lot 
Downtrodden

feet back
 Can you do anything about this acid burn
And I sit down next to her
 Oh They are called ankhegs you guys
 Well try Thank you Man normally Fjord
is here to do this part
 Thank you that does feel good I did
something today
 All right We leave
 Weve already lost two of our horses why
not lose a few more
 What
 You know if we stumble upon one of them
maybe be like Hey Met your grandma
 I know thats a big deal that whole
mission completing thing
 Yeah
 Fast pace
 Seven
 Im down as well but
 And in that hour we can look for a place
to rest Its like pushing for the next rest stop
 Can we look for a good camping spot
 Oh shit
 
 Disadvantage on your checks
 Along the way do we see anything that
looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would
be nice
 Which we have advantage on right
 A six and oh no advantage Ill take
that six with my add perception of three so nine
 Nein
 Hes hangry
 Yeah Im up too Molly you want to take
next watch
 All right
 
 Im not much of a gambler youre
thinking of Jester
 What
 What
 Wait are these like playing cards or
tarot cards
 You know I fucking hate those things
 I dont want anything to do with them
 The best lie Ive ever told
 Hmm
 All right deal
 Let me flip to my backstory

 Just in case here
 Natural twenty
 This one has a pretty big number on it
 Thats fascinating what kind of scam
 Wow
 Thats pretty fascinating
 Do you not like knowing your past that
way you can have multiple backstories Be multiple
people at once
 Ill tell you one of my best lies the
one I was most proud of
 Just because it was a pretty good one
 Yeah There was a politician in the town
where I grew up that I didnt like very much
 Didnt like his wife either Wanted to
find some dirt on them Pretended to be a house
hand for them a little handyman Found some dirt
found out they were cheating on each other and
destroyed their relationships and their lives
Maybe I shouldnt be proud of that actually
 Yeah anyway
 Cheers
 Just maybe dont have a job that relies
on relationships either
 Public opinion
 Yeah
 I do my morning pushup and pullup
routine
 And then Im ready to go
 Dope as fuck yes I do
 Holy shit you guys I just figured out how
we can save  minutes
  I feel like Im
always coming
 All right
 Did we catch up to them
 We shouldnt clue them off that were
here
 Okay Maybe a couple of us could flank
around Whats the terrain
 What time is it
 Were nowhere near Shadycreek
 Lorenzo is a fighter type
 What was the name of the rogue again
 Protto
them
 This is our fucking guy
 Wait in the cages
 So we wait until they camp
 What were you going to say Keg
if youre counting on whoevers in those cages to
help theyre not going to be able to Its going
to be five versus seven even if we attack at night
 Like mentally break them
 Fuck
 And set up an ambush
 Thats a damn good idea
 I wonder if we could do a little bit of
both Free the people in the cage and then ambush
later Nah that seems distracting
 At a medium pace
 Im the worst
 Helming a stealth check
 Well I already have it I just havent
used it yet
 Do I still have it I dont have it Oh
but I can look at it again
 I thought I might have needed it on the
thing but I rolled a natural  on my sack check
 Do I have to call that Im going to use
advantage on it before or I can roll and then choose
 Dont fuck me Gil Yeah its  total
  Should I do it again
 Oh that was almost a natural  but
instead its five
 Are we going to rest on the other side
It lasts a day Are we going to sleep on the other side
 Yeah Im going to save it Five
 Its got to be just long enough to where
theyre zoning out
 Not me Im tired
 We need to plan
 Thats actually not a bad plan just in
case
 Would they kill you on sight if they saw
you
 We used it on the troll and it did
nothing
 Horses arent a big threat I would
rather focus on the people
 Yeah but if we dont kill the people then
they can kill us
 These seem like people who are confident
in themselves
 Ooh
 How rocky are those hills in between
Could we trigger a rock slide
 Maybe using Keg as a distraction up
front
Lorenzo likes to make examples of people So what
would you guys do if I bought you time
 Couple Fireballs
 Have just certain targets between some of
us
 I could stun somebody depending on how
close I get Maybe Lorenzo try and square off
against him Of course all the spellslingers are
good to take out early as well
for Lorenzo so just be prepared if he goes down
first that shes probably going to go insane
 Maybe we focus on the druid and the
sorcerer
 I feel like if you could hold the
barbarian keep the barbarian away I could maybe
stun Lorenzo and focus down on the rogue and the
druid
 I have ball bearings
 I have rope Can we set some sort of
tripwire trap
 Is that something you can do Youre good
at finding traps Are you good at setting traps
 With that big swinging log thing
 We send Keg to distract You go in
 right but if they try to go around it
or something Its just a tree
 Thats the name of this next chapter of
our journey you guys
 No you go in and try and get the people
out of the cage
 But wait you cant see the cages
Theyre magically cloaked
 Until you get there Maybe you have to be
close enough You go in try and get them out You
come out send a signal through Caleb that youre
out and then Caleb does a big Slow thing slows
them down We go in punk their asses We win
Were victorious
 No with Slow Slow
 No we slow the people Hang on let me
go through this again We fell the tree We send
in Keg Keg distracts We send in Nott Nott tries
to pick the locks to the cages Get the people
out Nott runs Nott sends the message to Caleb
Caleb does the Slow spell on the party We go in
we kick ass we win were victorious I just said
that  seconds ago Did you guys get it this time
 No it is suspicious but its
distracting
 Thats dumb Maybe shes standing on the
tree and shes like Im a badass with an axe and
a hammer and I took down this tree and now Im going
to take down you
 Then we win were victorious Same
plan
 Okay okay Plan A
 Plan A you do that We try to slow them
If that fails youre our distraction
 Lets do it
 Oh snap
 Hes a witch Sam You know this He sees
the future
 It wasnt that undercover It was Max
going No cast is allowed in here for ten
minutes It wasnt that stealthy You werent
here for that
 We should get a mapmaking sock for him
 We are We wanted to film it this week
but we got super distracted with building the studio
 Taliesin wants to get rid of it
 I want to so bad
 Nott and I look for the best elements of cover
 Thats good Thats good
 Oh shes fine
 You beat me to it Im aroused
 You have an awesome axe right
 I enjoy gilding lilies
 You would think there was a tornado that
came through here
 I think the best trap we have is Keg
standing behind the tree
 Where are you going to hide
 Yeah
 Ill be in bush two
 Molly are you taking bush one
 Im bush two
 Yeah
 These are great codenames
 Do we have a signal as to when we go
Youre going to do the Slow spell and then we
fuck shit up
 Dry running it
 No this way
 Do you want to tradesies with Molly
 Yeah well its called Slow not Stop
If it was a Stop spell it would be called a Stop spell
 How far is your distance
 Okay so further
 I think we want to try and get the Slow
spell off after its past the log right
 No Because Im here Im here Calebs
here youre there Because this will make them
funnel which will gather them for Calebs spell
 What
 Why dont you tradesies with me then
 How wide is your spell
 Okay Its a foot radius
time
 A cube I mean its a foot cube
 Why would they be in a line Youre just
assuming theyre going to be in a line instead of
clumped together
 On the first one you Slow the second
one We attack we win Still winning is part of
this plan I just want to make sure that thats
clear
 Yes
 Look for our friends
 Oh yeah who has that shit Yeah you do
dont you
 Because you havent transcribed it
 Youre out of paper
 But youre out of paper
 And how many feet ahead did you set that
 So are we doing Invisibility or no
 Yeah I need to rest Im exhausted
 The sorcerer is the halfelf
 Yeah I can move  feet my speed Im
pretty quick
 Ive got some pretty dope mobility
 I think Lorenzo is going to be a problem
because he has reach and hes a leader
 If we find that halforc druids tend to have
healing abilities
 Im just saying if they reveal
themselves at the same time
 I feel like we shouldnt either
 We share body warmth by all spooning in a
chain
 Do I still have the dodecahedron
 I toss it to Nott
 Me too Im so scared
 Thats the sorcerer These are the two
magic users
 The barbarian is a human
 
 Add my boots
 
 A lot of bad guys there
 Ruzza the sorcerer Did the druid save
 The druid saved Dwelma
 Thats pretty dope though
 No Nott is Nott rolled a  and I
rolled a 
 Okay Im probably more than  feet away
from the druid
 Sweet jump
 It is what I live for Ten
 Oh fuck Okay Two attacks First
attack okay Thats a natural  plus seven is
 Right  plus seven
  and thats eight damage
 Im going to spend a ki point to do
Stunning Strike
 That really sucks
 I do have ball bearings Take my second
hit
 Thats  total
 Yeah Another eight damage Im going to
spend another ki point to try Stunning Strike again
 What was that plus three
 
 Im burning through so many ki points
 Im going to spend one more ki point to
do Patient Defense because Im probably going to
need it now
 Three ki points Burning them out
 I know so quiet
 Im still stoked on our was it
Umbrasyl The frost dragon
 Yes I am
 When Vorugal fought Yenk
 No I ran over there Im fighting the
druid
 Whos going to attack you
 The sorcerer
 Disadvantage
 Miss yeah
 Does that mean I get to take an attack on
her
 Mage Slayer
 I almost took that Took Sentinel
instead
 Yeah She was one of the ones that saved
Thats why I was trying to stun her
SAM What do you cast Dispel Magic on
 Fuck Thats why I was trying to stun
her I think she still could have done it though
 Thats not very good at all 
 What She doesnt move anywhere
 Shes not moving She cant move and she
takes five damage
 Natural 
 Yeah dont get frozen
 Oh no
 Fuck
 Thats a good call
 Oh God Damn this fucking druid Im
just going to lay into the druid
 Okay first attack Natural 
 Thank you Gil Thats doubling dice
 Really
 Second attack  plus seven so 
 I did  damage on my second attack on
her
 Fuck yes
 I have my bonus Can I move and then
attack again
 I thought about that but I have enough
movement that I can make it to the barbarian right
 Are you going to handle Lorenzo Whos
going to handle Lorenzo  Whos going to
handle Lorenzo Fuck Im going to jump over the
horses asses and get to Lorenzo
 
 I have  feet of movement so wherever I
can go
 Can I land on the horses back
 Im on a horse Am I within range of
him
 Im in combat range of him
 Im going to spend another ki point to do
Patient Defense I dont trust this motherfucker
Hopefully thats useful
 Yeah
 
 You get knocked unconscious
 Not that
 Am I flanking Molly
 I can as Sentinel
 
 Fuck
 No
  misses  hits
 I can still use Deflect Missiles right
to lower it
 You should know
 I have no respect for
authority
 Hes covered in shit
 Theres the barbarian on Caleb which is
not good
 Thats a lot of time
 I say
 Hey Keg no wait thats your
name Hey Lorenzo this ones for Beau no
fuck Im getting all my names fucked up because
Im so stressed out This ones for Molly and
Yasha because we failed on this before Im going
to get it right this time Im going to take my
tinderbox and light it and Im going to right
onto him light him on fire
 I mean Im touching him with it
 Okay
 d plus what
 Four
 I take my staff and pure brute anger
right across his face
 
 
 Six damage
 I take my movement and go towards Caleb
and Nott Fuck
 Yeah
 Didnt you have a thing held for the
sorceress
 Theyre going to try and capture Molly
 Shes dead
 Another four damage
 Fuck you Lorenzo
 Yeah dont ream us for all the things we
probably did wrong
 Theres nothing we can do to bring him
back is there Theres nothing we got
 Yeah We do need to decide something
Beau walks over to Keg and grabs Keg by the coif
and tries to slam Keg into the ground
 Did you think that maybe telling us that
Lorenzo was a high fucking magic user would have
been Or are you still fucking working with
them
didnt know
 Where is his fucking stupid tapestry
Where is it
probably going to take them to The Sour Nest
thats where they
 I go and I look Is his tapestry still
on her horse
 I storm over to it and I rip it off the
fucking friend he wasnt your fucking friend
Were taking this back
 I go over to Mollys body
 I think shes fucking right How long
have you been separated from these fucking assholes
 Its not a lot of time to
very fucking bright so theres a lot I probably
didnt pick up on but I dont know Im
realizing I dont fucking know anything about them
 I search Mollys body and look for the
tarot cards first
 I take those and I keep those to myself
Take the amulet
 Toss it to Caleb
 Im going to take what his dead body
isnt using any more
 Im going to leave him with everything
else I dont think we should take his sword
 Not without help anyway Did you guys
just suddenly fucking forget that they took Yasha
They took Fjord they took Jester
 Fuck you both
 Do yall remember what Molly said a few
weeks ago when he told us that he left every town
better than what he found it When he first told
me that I remember that my first initial knee
jerk reaction was You fucking arrogant
narcissistic bastard no one can fucking know
that He was an arrogant bastard but he was
right and do you know how I know We had a
conversation last night when we were up for watch
and he asked me what my greatest lie was and we
pulled fucking cards for it Loser would go first
He told me this story about tricking a town into
thinking he was royalty being a king to pull off
a scam I was almost going to tell him about my
childhood and I didnt Because he told that
when he was doing something shitty he was still
making people feel good or feel special The town
was being visited by graced by his presence by
his royal highness And I told him this story of
ruining a couples lives by extorting them because
I fucking could Because I fucking felt like it I
realized if I can deliberately leave a town
shittier than what I found it of course he could
fucking leave a town better than what he found it
And Im not going to do that again Im not saying
that Im going to go off and be a fucking hero
but maybe we can equal out and I can at least not
fuck any more shit up Take baby steps towards the
leaving the town better thing Thats the least
I can do for him And Im going to start with
these fuckheads
 All right
 Who the fuck is Lucien
 Im assuming Shadycreek doesnt have high
level priests and the Empire and churches and
stuff like that Doesnt sound like the type of
place that has
like that
 Yeah
 Or cut and run like you said
friend like that once just one They killed him
reason Im here I didnt think I would do it
again but I did I fucking froze up I cant
promise it but I promise that Ill try My life
isnt shit its never been Its kind of the shit
about meeting people that are actually kind is
that you realize what a fucking nightmare your
lifes been before
 Its funny how the good people can make
assholes like us feel so small
 I go back over to Mollys body and start
finding his coin purse Hes going to sponsor his
own campaign to resurrection
 Nott want a trinket To remember Molly
by
 Is that what you think Im doing
 I take the money
gets way worse once they get back to The Sour Nest
 Lets wrap him in his cloth
 It was impractical the moment he bought
it
 Its a pretty awesome sword from what I
remember
 Thats a good idea
  Mollymauks pretty unique
and different Its a good name
 I take the swords
 Or at least is there one fancy one and
one basic one
 Yeah well take that one Summers
Dance Well give it back to him if he comes back
to us
 Well and also there might be grave
robbers
 Looters yeah
 I help him
 Pour a drink
 Long may he reign
 Thats the best fucking shit I got
 Maybe you should write another note and
leave it on the coat that says Dont fucking
steal this you fucking looter assholes Dead
guys buried here
 I feel like a note could be very
convincing but thats fair All right lets go
 Keg
 Thank you
 I think we all would have been dead back
there had you not made your offer which you
didnt have to do Its noted
yeah
 What was your friends name
 No more running For Molly and Yuto
Deal
 Never a bad time
 Its a spy
 Kill it
 Thats so Molly
 Were jumping in a bouncy funhouse over
here Were having a grand old time
 Just so great
 I thought you were talking to yourself
again
 Oh
 Yeah youre not like a shared
hallucination right
 We ran into a tribe on the way here you
wouldnt happen to know an older woman named
Jumnda would you
 Nott thats
  Youre terrible
 She said a strong woman on a mission to
go find her son part of her clan was heading
north Would you happen to be Nila Or is it
Nyla Am I pronouncing that right
 It was Nila Nila
 Nailed it
 Its nice to meet you
 On our good days
 Thats pretty dangerous
 I like her I like her a lot
 Shes kind of right
 Show us
all the time but when I am ready I will summon
lightning from the sky and fry him destroy him
And I can do it again and again and again
 That sounds great
 Holy shit
 Yeah good for me
 All right We should keep heading on to
Shadycreek then
 No
dies in my clan we know that their spirit never
leaves It just gets returned to nature which is
why we protect nature so fiercely I have lost
people before I find ways to see them in nature
Sometimes the leaves on the trees I pick one
leaf and I know that it is a spirit waving to me
Your friend is here He has not left
 Yeah Im going to go start mounting up
the horses
 Yeah it was you two doubled up and I had
one
 Oh fuck
 Is it snowing Is there snow on the
ground
 Does it look like they tried to escape
the cage
 Then they dumped the bodies
of the road think this is his second warning
Third Fourth
 I think he just cares that little for
human life
 Ill help
 Yeah I have my cool reversible cloak
Shadycreek
 Is it Pass Without a Trace youre looking
at
 Yes so as long as we stay within  feet
of you we get plus ten to our stealth bonus
which would be very helpful
 Correct
 Thats badass I like that
 Share body heat keeps us warmer
 Beau tries to get a spot next to Nila
because shes large and fuzzy
 Ill take it
 Six total
 Im a little zoned out
 Is this a saving throw or just a check
 
 So cute
 Yeah Molly pays the toll
 Two four six eight ten Love you
Taliesin
 You know maybe people dont rely on you
because you havent been given the chance yet
Were certainly going to rely on you
 Itll be a good test run at least for
you Then you can go back to your tribe and be
like Yo people relied on me
 It was great you should rely on me
more
 I dont know They probably wont sound
like that
 You guys are going to have three horses
and then two riders
to make it look like a pack
 Okay
 Well hide under the horse like Indiana
Jonesstyle basically Holding on underneath
Okay thats going to take some grip strength but
Im into it
 Do they search you on the way in
 Ill hide as suitcase Ill be a bundle
 More stealthy
 You give us a bonus to our stealth
 Is it makes us more hideable
 You know the blanket in Lord of the
Rings
 The cloak
 Its like that
 Rocky things Sounds good
 Or I could be a pack on one of your guys
horse
 Almost like
 Mmhmm Im wrapped in a bedroll
 Plus ten right
 Add ten to your roll your plus stealth
 Its not good for me either  with the
buff
 Yeah thats good
 What is the name of that place again
you would imagine Not necessarily the most
trustworthy guy but it is run by the Marduns So
of the safe places in the town thats probably up there
 Amazing
  I agree
 I totally get the name of the place now
 Its very clever
 It seems that they dont have a strong
housing code They can get away with these more
unique builds Its very fascinating
 Its kind of cool
 Yeah but I didnt talk as animals I
wasnt talking
 As elementals I was like
 Run Jump Oh
shit
 I reverted thats all
 Its in the walls of the city or in city
limits
 Is it safe for me and Keg to hop out
without it looking shifty
 We do that
 I think horses have regular hearing
 Well need all of that above and a little
bit more
 Ive had a hard week
 What were you saying
 Champ His names Champ
shitter Yeah you might know me Hey are your
bosses around bosses around by any chance
 Sybaritic
 Nailed it
 Maybe well get lucky and the problem
she wants help with is the Iron Shepherds Two
birds with one stone we win Still going along
with that plan
 Has not changed
 The Molly problem was a hiccup Seems
kind of cold Anyway
these moments I have a little bag of treasures
that I smell Theyre little treasures that I
collect along the way of things that are
significant and meaningful to me If I smell it
it tells me what the experience will be like If
we leave this man and go to this Ophelia Mardun
let me see what my smell check does Okay
 Thats pretty crazy
 She might be
 Maybe we shouldnt stay here What time
of day is it
 To be fair this isnt The Iron
Shepherds hideout we said right
 Seems like they wouldnt come here Rival
family
themselves
 Yeah lets formulate a plan in the
morning I cant think right now Im a little out
of it
funny business all right
 Ill take a room for myself please
 I arrange for companionship and drinks
 It feels weird going and picking someone
out That feels dirty
 Yeah Just make her hot please
 No just an hour and then I want to be
alone please
 All right Then I get really drunk and I
go to my room for the night Send up booze
 Oh Right I open the door
 Uhh Hi
 Whats your name
 Okay
 Hot
 Yeah exactly
 Hotel prices What
 Beau comes down the stairs hearing the
end of it and just goes 
 I could learn a few things from you That
was a good apology Damn good
 I have a feeling maybe her business has
something to do with the Iron Shepherds as well
 Do you know anything about any of the
families here
goodberries and on the way out give one to each
of those horrible sounding roosters

 Is it a female
 Well I imagine we should also be
listening carefully right now as well as then
 Thats totally what he means
 Badge of honor
 I mean you could say it was a nice
little tussle It was a nice little square off
 Id say we both won
 I definitely won I won a few times

 Ooh Do they make my hickies go away
 Holy shit This is miracle cream Nila
Oh my god
 You could make a cosmetic line
 How does he do that
 Is it like a militia that theyre
forming
 Nila Is there something wrong with the
soil here or something Do you know anything about this
Do I have something that can tell Do you know

 You could do a general nature check
 No no Eight total
 All right
 What was the name of the forest
roll again
 You have to stop thinking that all people
who look like each other know everybody
 No
 Do they know how much further the
Marduns keep is
 You got this
Im not going to be able to talk to the bird
 Wow I mean how long is long for a bird
though
 Dagon can live to be  Shes going to
outlive us all
 Ooh spirits
 Bonespurred beasts Okay
willing to answer some more
 Ooh yeah
 Mansion
 Northwestish
picture of what that birds eye view would be and
to see if the bird has seen that
 Do they look like Taskers Do they have
the same armor
 Okay
 Hired hands
 And an important message
 Can I look around do I see anybody whos
hidden watching from windows up above anything
that looks like were being watched
 Not by guards necessarily 
 Did I catch a glimpse of what the figure
looks like
 Okay
 Yeah thats good
 Can I do an insight check Did it look
like she cast a spell just then
 
 Shipments to Zadash
 What all do you want us getting out of
that house
 You think all of the Iron Shepherds will
be there
 Do you know sorry You can go
Youre led to believe that they havent come back
to Shadycreek Run yet
 I wonder if theyre hiring
 How about something in trade Just as a
little added bonus as a favor
 Kind of like her demeaning me with that
little girl stuff Im kind of into it Anyway
that priest you mentioned Is he a pretty skilled
priest Would he happen to have any skills in
reviving the dead
 Sounds like he does specialize in those
abilities when you put it like that If exceptions
can be made for friends and family Friends and
family discount is a real thing
 What
 I was about to ask if I recognize any
wine
 Okay
 Nine
 Thats cool
 Oh yes
 Keep it down
 Member berries Member Jester
 Oh yeah I member
 You get all of your spells back after
sleeping as well
 
 We should plan
 Thats true
think would be the best Maybe something small
 And something native
 Just send the bird
 Nobody move You want to send an owl
towards that shadow see if Frumpkin sees what
that is
 Those were the bone spikes
  Can you do that thing
again
  So we can all sneak by
Pass Without a Trace

 Dont fuck me Gil Eh fuck you Gil
 
my thats why I was like it seems low 
 Three guards two hired hands and were
there two more regular individuals
 Could make a distraction in the woods
get one of the guards attention Bring them in
one at a time Ambush them Take their wardrobe
 Between me and Nila we could actually
get in pretty quickly I could get in with the
sword and she could be dropped in as a mouse
 Well then we do one of two things We
either send in Nila as a mouse to scout to see if
The Iron Shepherds are in there or we wait and we
watch and we see who comes in and out Watch the
guard shifts see when the changeover is
 A guard shift would be the most opportune
time to attack When theyre changing shifts
more people
 Keg do you know if these people would
have a secret entrance into the basement to the
dungeon area Tunnels
 Do the guards sleep here on the estate
or do they go home at night
 Through a gate
 I thought you said there was a
 Its a solid gate
area you could use Frumpkin as if Frumpkin was hunting
 To pick her up Helivac her out
 Owls eat mice Im just saying It makes
sense in nature
 Well help you find your son Keep it
together in there all right
 Now heres the thing
 goblin girl and
hobo wizard have this spell where they can talk
into your ear You probably wont be able to
respond back as a mouse except for maybe squeaks Squeaks
 Thats good
 Hes one of you Thats so generalizing
and demeaning
 Matt drowns the future comments
 Question where this collection of
barrels
 The collection of barrels Are they on
the inside in the courtyard
 How about we use that barrel pile as your
meeting point Well make sure that Frumpkins
watching the barrel pile and you get back there
when youre done scouting
 You got this and were relying on you
So you know dont fuck it up
meanings
 Oh my god this is so exciting
 Im so happy
from its head all the way down
 We sent in a laser pointer Shit
 My terrible map of what I think based on
what he drew
 Were the porthole windows in the wall or
in the actual building
 Do the spiral stairs go up and down
 Its the game show host problem
 Come on mouse Come on mouseypoo Oh
Thats good
 Try and squeeze under This is when a
natural  is aw
 There might be a hole in the floor or
something else
keep looking to see how many Iron Shepherds there
may be in any other location that I havent
explored
  Awesome What did you learn
 That was awesome
 She didnt die as a mouse
 She turned into a mouse and then came
back and was helped back out by your birdcat
Thats awesome
 We know that there are members of The
Iron Shepherds here and we know they have beds
here Wait until the fall of night
 Take out the guards kill them in their
sleep
 How long is it to travel to get back to
town
 Not as far as I thought
entrance or exit underneath that trap door I
couldnt get in but I heard the voices and I
heard many people under there
 If I know anything from my time in the
criminal underworld its these people always have
secret passageways in and out We could do like a
wide walk of the perimeter see if we find
anything outofplace in the forest See if
theres a path and if we dont find anything
make our way back into town Look for a hired
hand
 Again with the burning thing
 So Lets search around and see if we can
search the woods
 Perimeter check
 Super stealth
 Run Yeah run We run back to town Fuck
the perimeter search
 Away directly from the building
 Great game
 How was it from the lobby
 Yes Nila
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 We mentioned about going and looking to
see if a Tasker would be up to it There were the
Taskers and there were the other group of hired
workers
 Is it like the Grudge Gang is an
umbrella corporation of the Taskers or vice versa
 I mean just to play devils advocate
here is it an issue if we get a hired mercenary
group to kill another underground faction in their
same town Is that
what you are saying
 Yeah I dont know its a weird
political issue hiring someone in the system
 Well this Ophelia wants us to kill
everyone in the motherfucking house
 I think shes right
 Plus who knows who could arrive in the
time that were gone
 I think we need to be prepared for all of
them
 I miss Jesters healing spells
 I mean look The solution might end up
solving itself who know who in this town is even
willing to go up against the Iron Shepherds
 Smoke them out Thats actually not a bad
idea now that I think about it though
 
 Sorry Im just imagining an infiltration
with the spider like thats feasible
 Go Frumpkin go
 Put him in his boot
 Sure Literally anything is better than a
spider though For that I just want to point that out
 I mean theyve got a lot of eyes I get
that but I think in terms of a movement
situation spiders arent the best
 Shady Debaters
now
 Laura make a Shady Debaters debate team
shirt
 Ive got a little bit of funds
 If you go under equipment
 Same
care of folks on watch The onion youre talking
about maybe the outer layers are the hired hands
and then were the ones who go in
 I have one
 Healing potions
 That does help
 Those are good Those are great
clan we have a bear spirit known as Oaktar If I
invoke the spirit of Oaktar it gives us each
extra power
 Im into it yeah
need fighters we need magic What do we need
 I like the idea of getting some sort of
fighter especially if Nila can maybe take out
that outer onion layer with the lightning We
should have found a better analogy
 I like that
 Ophelia mentioned that yeah
 Aid
 I oddly trust that more than hiring
someone from The Grudge Gang
 I feel like The Grudge Gang might have
ties to the Iron Shepherds or at least an inside man
 Ive seen some pretty badass priests in
my day
 Did we hear what god they worship
 I feel like if it was one of the accepted
gods of The Empire you wouldnt have to hide out
in the woods Im kind of into this idea
 The ones in captivity
 Probably pretty unstable
susceptible to torture
 Being controlled
 They arguably have their shit together
way more than the three of us do
 Yeah especially Jester
bit more time
 What time is it
 You said its four hours there
 Brisk power walk there thatll get us
there right around sunset Talk to people Power
walk back should get us there back
 Yes in time for Saturday Night Live

watching it
 Great
 We might be able to go and get back in
time is what Im saying and still be able to
attack tonight
 If it is a total bust then that sucks
 Thats true
 All right lets go Are you good with
that Nila You seem apprehensive
you right now
 Well shall we
 You know like grandmas in malls like
around Christmas time
 Yes
 Thats still reliance
 Nott do you want the middle
 Fuhwumpkin
 That was almost great
  Yes yes
 We cant see over the wall
 I think this is the place
 We buried him with it
 But thats a good idea
it with my axe
 This is what I used to do to hop fences
back in the day I look for a few brokendown
branches that might be my height
 A handful
 Ten
 Before I do anything with it I take it
over to Nila Nila have you seen any type of
blight on a plant like this before Do you know
what this is Its cold feel it
 I take the branches and I try to lay them
down over the vines a little bit and give a little
less thorny of a ramp
 Look they hook all on their own thats
pretty good
 Thank you look at that
 On the tombstones that are around do I
recognize any of the language or can I tell how
old some of these gravesites are
 
 Until recently okay
 Whats the name
 Tyriel Castala
 Casala
 Wait back up a second Are you Mr
Clay
 Caduceus Clay
 Is that Caduceus with a K or a C Okay
 Caleb and I will share one and I hand the
other to Nila
 A few great tragedies
 Well the first one is I think its
time for Caleb to have another bath Its been a
little bit
 Being without a shower has been a bit of
a tragedy
 No
 I didnt want to open the gate like that
Thats why were here
 Do you only gauge time in seasons
 Thats fair
 Were drinking dead people tea
 Very true But youre cultivating dead
people for good tea
 Yeah okay Yeah Thats a good point
 Okay well beyond helping our recently
passed friend how do you feel about helping
people who are on the edge of life and death in
captivity
 And they might not have long to live
 Were working on it
 Dead bramble Dead mushrooms Dead moss
 Is there a watering system or can you
put it on a timer if youre not going to be here
 Maybe were in a rush maybe after
 Well we came to you
 You dont have a particular penchant or
sympathy towards people who eat babies do you
 Was that you saying youre willing to
kill people and put them in the ground to make compost
 Oh man youre seeing me at a relatively
calm moment actually
 Dont overthink it
  Fungal armor
 Your blood you got some to spare You
can get more of it Thats how your body works
 Hey Clay Did you bury Tyriel Colsala
here
 Yeah him Thats what I said
  Casala
 Were you around when you buried him
 All right
 Power walking
 We might be all right
 Yeah no
 The fuck
 Im going to try to catch it
 Okay I roll a d
 A ten Plus my monk level right Which
is five
 d plus eight Oh its my monk level
plus my proficiency bonus so no damage
 And third of all that was a killing
blow
 You could fucking kill me
 Im keeping this bolt this is mine now
 I rip the other one out Yeah I put
that and Im keeping this one too
 Dont infect me
 Okay this shits dope
 That wasnt for you Never mind
 I think we were going to go straight
there
 Its on the way
 Its on the way I say we at least stop
by and scout it
 How long after dusk has it been
 Are you being facetious I cant tell
 How many seasons old are you
 
 Im still afraid if we roll into
Shadycreek once again just pointing out what we
acceptablelooking people and someone with a
reputation Well by societys standards
 Look come on
 Im just saying we will draw attention
to ourselves and then we might go around asking
people to kill the Iron Shepherds and that might
draw more attention to ourselves in a town that it
feels the Iron Shepherds kind of run Or at least
have a better foothold in it than we do
question One more person sure A healer Sure But
 Do you know Ophelia Clay
 Sorry you just had a face like you
recognized
 Okay
 Anyone in particular feel super strongly
about going and getting more help Should we put
it to a vote
 What does your smell bag say Do we go
and we get more people or do we go to the house
necessary
 Make a smell check
have two firbolgs
 I mean shes so convincing
theyre on home turf they have more people than I
thought more abilities than I thought I mean we
hire a couple of Taskers I know its not ideal but if
 All right new plan We split the party
 Half go to the house the other half go
look for more help and then we meet you
 Watch
 All right
 Lets go to the house
 Yeah
 Lets go Were wasting time just
talking
 Well go look
 Shit
 Ive got fireworks
stinky not like what you call my stink pouch
 He isnt
 
 Can you bring him back I kind of want
that arrow
 Do you have an illusion that you can do
that Its a good idea Maybe we shouldve done
that to begin with
 All right Who votes for more muscle
Lets put it to a vote
 How tall is the wall How would I be able
to get on the wall
 Are we walking the perimeter If were
doing a perimeter walk I want to look and see if
there are any branches and trees that might be
growing close to the wall that I could
 Yeah weve got to do both at the same
time ideally Theres got to be a team one and a
team two on the guy Ive got my throwing darts
but theyre not super great
around it right Its just a lightning bolt We couldnt
 Also sometimes maybe its just a stormy
night here in the forest
 Okay heres what Im going to propose
Well do the plan that worked when we were doing
it on kids and we didnt know we were doing it on
kids Me and you can throw up a bottle rocket
That will be the signal We attack both of the
guys at the same time two different sides
 But if its loud and theyre both dead
afterwards
 We want to murder everyone inside and
rescue the people who are trapped
 All right lets split up take these
guys out
 Jesus
 We wait an hour and get into position
 We watch the passing shadows in front of
the windows
 No Im right next to you
 Yeah I was just trying to move things
along
 Yeah well wait Well just wait an
hour
to ruin any stealthiness
 Thats what I was thinking at least to
get into place and then put it back on
 Okay Until the next shift change I
could use a short rest anyway
 I think so
 Can I take a short rest
 And we watch
 And we solidify our plan
 How are you lifting that
 Have they done a guard shift yet
 Go Charlotte go Youre radiant
 How big is that spider
 That looks like a three hit point
spider
 Thats arguably terrifying Ill give it
to you I was a little wrong just a little
 Im not terrified of it Im just saying
it could be terrifying Hi Frumpkin
 One firbolg each
 Well take the old one
 Table and Table
 I dont know I can only hear muffles
Choice words I think theyre talking about you though
 Oh yeah
 Death is weird am I right
 How tall are you
 Would you be willing to give me a boost
up that wall
 Copy
time but Ill get it
 Also the thing I was looking at our
version of the smell bag Its like this artifact
that we got from an assassin that lets you look
into the creation of space and time and the universe
 Yeah
 Anyway
 How far does your Message work
 So we wouldnt be out a Message range of
each other
 When I get up there and grab him Im
going to bash his head in and Im going to throw
him down and if hes still alive you get him
 I was figuring I would be on her
shoulders and we would suck up against the wall
 Well see yeah Right underneath him
 Keg
 But not as short as Nott
 Pass it along
 Makeshift harpoon Thats pretty cool
 Lets just do this Come on
 Were going to wait for our guys to
pace
 Uhhuh with Pass Without a Trace
 Go Pass without a Trace
 Were going
 Im on her shoulders Im up against this
fucking wall Youre doing this Im going to try
and 
 I want to wait until right after he
passes and then I want to do some ninja stuff
 I do
 Thats true
 Mmm
stealth
 Then that gives me a  total Okay 
Look
 I cursed you
 Hes held
 As soon that I see that hes held I am
going to jump up and try and grab him by the pants
and bash his head in and then throw him down
 Okay Just a straight attack
 Okay  No sorry 
 Aw I rolled a one Plus two plus four
Six damage
 I go
 Nila now
have it 
 I will finish my attack right as she
whacks her staff Im going to let go and try and
time it to where I land on the staff with her
 Mmhmm 
 
 Thats much better Eight plus four so
 damage
 I do the same thing I slip into the
guard uniform
 Would you mind giving me another boost
real quick
 I look over at Deuce and give a nod
 I can unlock the front entrance for you
guys
 Do we want to go front entranceback
entrance
 Yeah make sure we get the gold out of
our dudes pockets youre right there on the ground
 Is there anything on the dudes armor
that I put on
 Investigation
 I say
 Meet at the front gate
 I think you still have Pass Without a
Trace on
 Lasts for like ten minutes I think
 Lasts for an hour
 I signal to Deuce I dont know what else
to call you
 Clay
 Hey look at the windows too
 Okay Im going to slowly start pacing
around towards the front Im also going to look
into the windows Do I see anything from my
vantage point
 Natural  Thanks Gil
 Coast looks clear I dont know why I did
this with my fingers
try to go downstairs and get your friends
 Its within  feet of her so yeah I
think she should be good But I think you have to
cast it on the people within  feet of you
 For the duration each creature you
choose within  feet
 We dont see that
 I didnt see that
 Kill it Kill it
 Yeah she did
 The hallway down the right is the one we
want to go to if I remember correctly
 With the trapdoor yep
 Is it Phil
 I take back mocking you for your choice
 I thought it was going to blow our
cover
 I do another check to see if I see any
movement upstairs
 I just want to make sure
 By the window
 All right
 The rogue did blow it
 Dont die
 Also  Im actually going ahead and
roll my d with this as well Plus seven 
Sorry 
 Wait who was a  You
 Okay
 I want to look at the window Do I see
that figure I just saw Does it seem like the pots
and pans got that figures attention and theyre
hastily moving
 Okay where am I
 Im over there
 Okay I am going to do I try and make a
distraction or run
 Im going to light one of those
firecrackers again and Im going to toss it this
direction towards the front of the door
 Natural 
 I want to try and aim it to where it
sounds like theres a commotion happening at this
front door to draw people this way and not at the
back
 Im assuming that was my action
 Okay Im going to use my movement to
just haul ass towards these guys
 Yeah
 Okay
 Im coming into you though Im coming
into you guys
to go inside
 Okay Have I heard my cherry bomb go
off
 Oh what Amazing Okay Im going to
move my full speed my  feet Does it get me in
 
 Okay
 Im going to use no Im going to use
my action to move again to dash
 Nope Im going to go that way
 Okay I dont want to peek around the
wall I want to ninja dash around and I want to
get up against the wall peek and look for anyone
who might be coming around that hall
 As I ran by I went
 Psst To Caleb to
let him know that I was here and going that way

that thing that makes me move fast Step of the
Wind yes

I go here lift up the gate Lift up the trapdoor
 Youre going down
 You dont want to bring him up Okay
 Im going to go down with Clay but just
at the stairs since I also look like a guard

soldiers We block this corridor looking like soldiers
 Just backs to that corridor in this
room
 Yup like were watching guarding this
room together
 Youre supposed to be good at this
 Did you just roll two ones in a row
 Well we relied on your mate here
Couldnt have done it without her
 Now if I was you Id run
 You have a child with you You need to
get him out of here Hes suffered enough Weve
got it from here
 We wouldnt have gotten this far without
you
 Well see you later
necklace of six red feathers Four of these

for oh shoot So emotional but I know it
Duma and Masag Masag was one of our strongest
They took him too and Duma was the little one

leaving my tribe to find my family and I took an
extra one because I thought I would find friends
who might help me I will give it to you I undo
the feather pull it off its a perfectly intact
red feather I dont know who will take it but if
you ever need our help you can come to the
temple If by chance were not there but only
because one of us would go back to check on the
others of our tribe well be in the Crispvale
Thicket Just go where the moss is the thickest
and Ill be there Thank you for everything Thank
you so much
 Well find you again Nila

 We are dressed like guards Where are we
Are we on the outside of the cellar or are we down
 Wheres the body of the other guard we
killed
 Is he just chilling
 We just killed him man
 Okay so well go up into the cellar and
And shove the guards
 Nott lets put him in the cage and maybe
hell
 You know Caduceus I think theres
actually merit to your plan Im kind of into it
 Damn shame
 Just stay here in case when Caleb and
Keg get back
 Were going to have them chase the
escaped prisoners
 Keg doesnt have object permanence

Wikipedias Okay I guess Ill go back down to
everyone else
 Im going to face away since I dont have
the disguise spell and look really perturbed
towards the prison
 I say shut up you miscreant and I
backhand Nott
 I have his face though
 Yeah he had the disguise spell
  Not great
 Oh what Aw cool
 Wasnt expecting that The one who drew
his blade Im going to try and take an elbow and
do a knockout crack right to his temple
 That wasnt a Gil die but Ill let you
know when it happens 
  damage and can I do a stunning strike
Crack
 Fail Its only worked like once before
 As he backs up Im going to take his
head and slam it back into the wall he just ran into
 Good because that was a natural one

 
 Im going to say
 Shut up And crack him
across the face again with my bonus my offhanded
 That was a Gil but he did good 
 Nine damage
 Shh go to sleep
 Im going to take my scarf wipe the
wall

 Yeah
 I know what you mean
 I poke my head out and I go
 You owe me a
Ill be back in like an hour and  minutes
 If its two hours dont come looking for

 Medallion of five oclock shadow
 Oh my god
 You guys Ive never gotten morning
after

 Its almost as good as the Kerrek letter
you guys
 Hang on youve got to have the full
experience First off For Bo spelled wrong
 I love
 You can see it She was trying to write
Your eyes are beautiful when you smile I love Thanks

 Ill cherish this forever
 I feel like we grabbed it right
 Its okay We already got in touch
 With Ophelia Mardun who was yes thats
what I was about to say
 Were doing okay We already got in touch
with Ophelia who is the woman we were supposed to
get in contact with We were like a day or so
late but she was fine with it But she wanted us
to go kill Lorenzo and the rest of the Iron
Shepherds so it was a very convenient killing one
group of slavers with one stone
 He makes dead people tea Its very nice
tea
 Cemetery tea
 Honestly you could make a lot of money
setting up a shop somewhere and selling tea
 Ophelia first then Mollymauk Its all
along the way
 Theres some carts around back Two to
be exact Some horses thatll make up for Waterloo
and or Water Closet and Loo and Toilet Oh yeah
by the way we also lost like three horses
Theyre all dead too
 WCs gone
 Sounds good
 We steal horses We make a nice little
bed for Yasha and lay her down
 Can we break down the cages easily or
bring the cages off the cart
 Can we get rid of them though
 I put my hand through the cage bar Do I
see anything
 Fuck
 Yeah
 Sick
 Ill take one of the other horses
 Ill ride a horse
 That was good Snaps for that one
 You could have said it too
  Ashley come back
 Weird question The carts arent sprayed
on the side with Iron Shepherds
 Okay cool
 Ill flip my coat inside out to my brown
side and put up the hood
 I take everything I just said back
 Yeah
 Shes super hot
 No thats not doable Do you have a
wider gate around back or something like that
 You personally
 Hes very personal with the cart
 Um If you dont mind it would actually
be greatly appreciated to us if we kept that for
the fallen member of our party
 Thats very kind of you
 You want us to go with you
 Thats right we were supposed to escort
her back Yep
 I think hot fuck is actually very
appropriate on a few levels
 I dont know
 Why does she want to leave This cant be
good right
 Its along the way
 Its not that this was really the job it
was more like there were two jobs You had to
accept both as opposed to one or the other and
the one was doable and we did it and the other one
 Well she said the morning
 Not at all yeah
 Yeah you guys probably didnt see a lot
considering you were in cages when you came
through but this is a shitty shithole Like a
really shitty shithole
 You live in a very nice garden an hour
north of here The city is garbage
 You havent left in  years
 It is very beautiful
 He is We asked the same question
 Yeah the smell comes with it Its got a
little musk Yeah
 When you two mix together it has this
meatloaf smell
 How many people
 That are sitting with her
 How many that she wants to sit with
her
 Okay
 Its not that we dont care for these
animals its just that we cared for Water Closet
and Loo and John way more
 I just wanted you to know
 But yeah fuck these horses
 Definitely Mamma Mia
 I wish you could still read lips
 Yeah I was going to say
 I do not miss
Sam Riegel giving me shit about my spell usage
 Mmhmm
 Its funny I thought you were going to
say something like Man the Empires sure fucked
thinking the same thing Its just like what
 Well you know Im a monk of the Cobalt
Soul I actually dumped a lot of this on Nott She
asked We were a little tipsy
 I was feeling vulnerable in the moment
It doesnt happen often She caught me in a
perfect window
 Nott did Wait both Nevermind
 I never intended to be a monk of the
Cobalt Soul My father sent me away to the
monastery when I wasnt what he wanted me to be
And I was kind of a dick So
 I ran away from the Cobalt Soul and they
gave me a raise in rank because of it That was
kind of cool Really just further instilled my
rebellion to be totally honest
 My whole life was dictated by
establishment that I didnt have a lot of control
over The Cobalt Soul has this underlying faction
that helps uproot corrupt establishment I know I
scoffed at the idea of being a part of a system
thats supposed to take down systems It doesnt
really make sense but you know Maybe you if
anyone can understand the idea of fighting fire
with fire Thats why Im doing this
 No They just want information Im out
in the world at the ground level People like us
tend to have our fingers on the pulse of whats
being said around the city sometimes Its not
necessarily something that a monk in full
accolades can always accomplish
 Yeah
 Does that make you uncomfortable
 Cool
 Ew Dont do that

 Have we made it outside the city
 So were still north of the Crispvale
Thicket
 I grab Jester by the hand and walk her
over
 Really
 Right That makes sense
 I think so too
 You know I grabbed his stupid cards
 You want to draw one
 Old faithful
 
 I put my hand on the other one
  Whats he doing
 What did you just do
 After a while you lose track of favors
Its okay
 It wasnt a favor though You guys are
the only friends Ive ever had Most people in my
life just leave Anyone Im not driving away I
guess I should probably try and start keeping
people around at this point
 That is an incredibly random thought
 And make things better
 At least three weeks right
 Did you break down the platinum
 We took about  gold
 I rolled like crap considering
 Its like I need to speak to The
Gentleman
 I have it written down somewhere
 Im sure were fine
 Yeah
 I go
 Yeah its this way Thats to the
bathroom
 Pay day
 We got a tip
 Yeah we probably shouldve told you that
before we brought you in here
 Is it still an open bar
 I go to the bar
  Someone give him a white
russian

 If you like milk youll love this
 You all right there bud
 No you dont
 Im going to sit down as well Sit in a
little booth in the back corner Back corner boothin
 Oh god
 Yeah it was honestly this is why I
dont wear white
 Fjord you survived being chained up and
tortured Thats got to fuck with a person right
 Fjord you cannot keep blaming yourself
when you were the victim in this circumstance You
understand that right
 There are people to blame I wasnt
joking when I said it was someones fault earlier
but it is not yours The only person whose fucking
fault it was is that fucking asshole Lorenzos and
fucking human traffickers
 Theres also no reason that the three of
us couldnt have made a fucking plan that couldnt
have gotten Molly killed
 What do you want to do
 Yeah How did Jester do No offense but
she seems like shes a little bit more willfully
stronger than you are
 Yep
 I dont know she looks fucking stoked to
me right now
 Yeah
 You dont drink it because it tastes
good
 Eyy
 If it had to be anywhere
 I go
  Jester Nott
  Come sit down Damn it
 Go like this go
 
 Can you feel it Can you feel that
 
 Oh man
 No you dont have to
 That one place right next to the smut
shop that had the really good doughnuts
 Molly would want us to go to the
bathhouse
 To the Tealeaf
 Now to our new Tealeaf
 Oh yeah
 You talking about experimenting with how
many weapons we can see
 So heres my question If we dont turn
in the crystal eyeball
 If we dont have that does that mean
bounty hunters are going to come after you
 Do we see this Do we see this
happening
 Shes totally flirting with him just to
get the goods
 Oh yeah She doesnt actually like
want this she just wants to maintain a good relationship
 Yep Look shes like Mmm please stop
touching me
 Hey Caleb
 Youre a good friend Please dont ever
ask me about my sex life
 I only have gold I dont have checks

at my friends in celebration
 For Molly

 Thanks Caduceus
 Mmhmm
 Have you ever been to the Menagerie
Coast How far south have you been
 Yeah me neither
 Thats a plus you guys Going in the
wintertime kind of sucks
 Plus further away from the frontlines in
this war
 I feel like her and Molly always had a
connection She always knew how to find us because
she knew how to find Molly
 What
 Your past self isnt allowed to laugh at
current things
 No reactions from Molly here
 Its so great
 Plus it sounds like gauging by this
letter someones going to catch up with us sooner
or later looking for whatevers inside of you
 How we look at you sometimes Like youre
awesome Like were awestruck
 Thats accurate yeah I do look at you
like that sometimes
 So you want to find Sabian and hope that
he has the answers
 And youre sure this motherfucker was
like sole sabotager
 I mean no offense or anything but these
sound like some crazyass fucking sailors
 Fjords angry marble in his chest
 Oh
 Disguise yourself
 Oh right
 I mean you dont want to give  I
think whatever gifts youve been given theyre
natural and progressive I mean figure that out
on your own first You dont want to give them
back right
 Theyre called gifts for a reason right
Itd be rude to give them back
 Kidney stones
 Yeah
 Me too
 I so want to meet your mom
  Thanks Max
 Youre from Deastok
 I mean
 Nott it looks like the main road goes
through Felderwin anyway
 Yeah but yep youre right Maybe
thats thats a river Thats not a road
 Thats a real big
 But still
 You basic
 You know I had that as Keyleth at later
levels I never fucking used it
 We got super busy
 Its a bad thing to have at later levels
it was better at lower levels
 Invisicart
 Didnt we have a couple more too
 Oh thats right
 Indisposed
 Thats an old joke
  Theyre in the rafters
 Pigeons everywhere
 Yeah its nice right Its like a
little postcoital feeling kind of
 Its true
 I know so close
 Back in Alfield
 This is where Bryce lives right We
should check in with Bryce
 Shift pods
 Hey Thadeus
 Is Bryce in
 Broad Barn
 Im finding a bunch of old dumb jokes
 This isnt where we left no This isnt
where we left Reginald No okay
 To be fair I dont remember him
 Sometimes they arent regular though
sometimes theyre undead ones
 Yeah But we fought both
 What are you doing here You working here
now
 Yeah
 This might have been the first town we
did good
 Because we kind of got a guy
 Arrested and thrown in jail for
 Came through in the black not broken
even
 Ey Yeah
 Totally know exactly what youre talking
about
 Soot and dirt yeah
 Wait when did this happen
 Yeah thats when Dairon decided to go
right Or was she already out there
 Sorry
 Yeah
 How is the Starosta Is he still a pain
in the ass
 Whats the best penis youve ever seen
 I still want that question answered but
he can go ahead
 Whats the matter Even if she hadnt
seen them voyeuristically
 Why are you so interested in peoples sex
lives Caleb
 Yeah whats your best dick
 Oh
 Did we scare them away
 Oh god
 Question
 What was the name of the town that Gustav
is stuck at
 Its the next one
 Were in Alfield Thats where I stole
mail Okay I was getting confused if we were in
Okay Cool Do you guys want to stop in down in
Trostenwald on our way
 You know we have a little bit more money
now maybe we could help Gustav out a little bit
The last good thing that we could do
 Im sure he would also like to know about
Molly
 You know I never really thought about
the fact that when youre with someone when they
die its kind of your responsibility for forever
to tell anyone who doesnt know what happened
 That kind of sucks So lets keep sharing
bad news
 Thats true
 No furthest south Ive been I think is
Trostenwald
 Yeah
 You could continue your swimming
lessons
 Sure lets just do that
 What Youre really good
 Firstborn
 Maybe theyre a trail marker
 Lets go knock them over
 Are we near where the gnoll mine was
 Oh we found a few of those bags
 What if its a trap
 Can you do that ritual on the cart as we
drive away
 Eight
 Find another geocache Come on
 Ooh yeah maybe thats the guy
 Were hiding in the invisible cart
 Yeah why dont we stop by the Nestled
Nook
 See whos there
 Same for me
 I flag down Adla
 Adelaine

 Yeah I was curious if youve seen Gustav
around Tall thin elvishlooking man
 I thought he was working off his debt I
thought he was right
 Interesting All right thanks
 Another round of drinks
 Oh well I didnt have you around for a
little bit keeping me in check
 I tried to do okay though I think I did
all right Did I do okay Caleb
 Never mind
 What time is it
 Sure
 No
 So generous
 Great for cats
 Maybe we can wheel and deal with him Pay
a lump sum now and consider it debt repaid time served
 Thats right
 Hi
 Caduceus What the hell
 And where are you getting all of this
insight
 Im not arguing prison politics
 I agree with you I just feel like
theres a supernatural situation going on here
that youre not necessarily telling us
 How much
 She wanted to do 
 I throw in  thats Mollys but also
hang on Before we do all this Listen Norda I
know we caused a lot of a headache for you when
all this was going down
 So were simply trying to take one more
headache off of your list of a lot of headaches
Were trying to do a good thing A man in jail
doesnt do anything for your city but I bet 
right now would
 Dont have to feed him
 Think of what you can do for this town
with  gold right now because let me tell
you we cant give you that  So we either
walk and youre stuck with a prisoner for another
nine months or you take the 
 Jazz hands
 Hey Natural  Yeah jazz hands work
every fucking time
 
 All right
 How much was it Ive got  that was
Mollys
 I can throw in money as well because
that was part of my goal
 Okay
 Maybe you could find her
 Were heading to the Menagerie Coast
 Youre more than welcome to hop on the
wagon if you want Cant promise much more beyond that
 Do you mean that Like if we ever need
you can we hit you up
 Yeah but Im asking because he offered
 I dont need you right now
 Yeah okay
 Fjord does this mean Im not the most
abrasive person in the group any more
 I toss Caduceus a little pouch
 Thats whats left of Mollys gold 
Figured since you put down so much money for a
stranger to be busted out a little bit of
reimbursement
 Why Whyd you do it
 Thats a lot of money for an esoteric
reason
  gold
 Oh
 
 I was gonna toss in way more but you

 Exactly
 I couldnt decide if he looked more like
a professor or more like a Thaddeus and then I realized

go back and I want to train Professor Thaddeus
to come when I look regal and hold out my arm

used to it

 My passive perception 
 
 The chagrin
 And it stands out like a sore thumb

 You know its fine exactly
 Like people deliberately trying to stay
away from it
 Does it look like its been there for a
really long damn time
  Wait nope  Wrong thing
 
 I mean these bricks look so new
 Did I see an entrance
 No
 Okay Do you want to go that way and Ill

tower
 Id imagine you fly Or maybe theres an
underground entrance Around go under and up
 Are you asking me to try
 All right you want to give me a boost
 Okay I want to see if I can boost off of
Fjord and maybe get up to this tower Does it look
like these are bricks that can

 You know I feel like youre throwing a
lot of shade about us investigating this tower

 Do you have wizard envy Its okay its
a very large tower
 Is that close to here
 Well lets go into the Quay we havent
been in yet right
 Wait but the Open Quay was a lowlife

 again Nope sorry  Keep looking at the
wrong numbers
 Okay once again with the shade towards
trying to climb the tower

 I run over and I untie the boat from the
thing I undo the rope Are we hitched to the dock
with rope And anchor
 With a cleat or whatever theyre called
I work on that because Im assuming the anchor is heavy
 The anchor Okay thats opposite from
what I said
 Im trying to undo do I also have time
to get the anchor up
 I will focus on untying and getting it
off and then I do the thing that you do where you
push on the side of the dock and I try and get us
like 
 I get it untied The boats untied
 Yeah they thought Vox Machina were
assholes
 The AC of wood
 Yeah

 Just add BE to the list
 I only unfurled so if Yasha can yank up
that anchor thatd be dope
 Now were ready to go

 What are we doing
 I can feel Traviss Dad disappointment
like radiating
 Its hot
 Miss
 I see Fjord bash his head against the
wall and I go you guys I think Fjords under
some sort of influence magic Hes not himself
Then I yank the
 Tell me what to do
 You motherfucker
 I try and interpret what he says Hoist
the thing
 He realized he was being dumb
 He did that
 He saved from the spell
 Yeah it interrupted that with the
fight
 Oh god
 Help me Yasha

 Which is
 Who the fuck are you You piece of shit
 I know who he is Im asking him Fucking
piece of shit
 No we know Im saying youre a piece of
shit
 So many things
 I did say that I kind of did I was
like Gentleman
 Hes a runner Who were you supposed to
deliver it to
 Mysterious folk Where were you supposed
to drop it off You knew where you were supposed
to deliver it so where were you supposed to
deliver it
 Squall Eater
 I take a handkerchief and I shove it into
his mouth and tie that around too
 To be fair the goal was to just ask and
then it got out of hand
 You guys we own a ship
 Oh yeah  Professor Thaddeus
 Professor Thaddeus
 Im going to try to throw up some bait

 Okay Im going to roll big Im not
going to roll big Im going to roll great
 I had him with me 
 Yeah I imagine when I fought I was like
Go hang out
 
 He is Hes happy Hes happier that way
He was like me Hes not meant to be tied down
 Hes not dead Hes just running far away
from me
 Professor
 Man thanks for that You keep presenting
with stuff that we dont really want but then we
see it and were like We need it Then we dont
want it like animals Now we have a boat
 Freudian slip
 Its bad when you say it like that
 What
 Thats right
 You can Speak with Dead though right Is
that something you can do
 Maybe thats how we interrogate him
 Ill help you out
 Yashas following me Im like
 You can
follow me but Im just
 
 It just looks more dope now
 Yeah we look like badasses I think it
makes the ship look cooler
 Yeah we look rad
 Yeah
 I was going to say thats how we know
Caleb is serious But
 But we still have the ink of that
 And Darktow is also an island
 I dont know I got distracted by the
sleeveless coat aspect Thats all I heard
 The Mistake
 Hes kind of the worst
 The second
 Right
 You want me to wake him up
 All right okay
 
 That was gentle right
 Good morning
 Dont think that far into it man It was
a cool line
 Probably not
 How many times have you worked with
Jawgrasp or Avantika in the past
 And what were you doing for them before
 Well thats his own damn fault he has
poofy sleeves
 Fucking bullshit
 

 Yeah
 Throw them overboard

 Yeah you should
 It was a pretty fucking dope thing Okay
Here is the thing this reputation you keep
talking about That you are so deeply concerned
about
 Aw Can I have it  Deflect
missiles
 Why are you so concerned with this
reputation of yours How long have you been
running around in the criminal underworld is what
Im saying
 No Ive met this type He plays stupid
that way if people start asking questions youve
got disbelief
 Still doesnt mean youre not a criminal
though
 Take a little walk well continue
talking when you get back
 God I hate him
 Wait does the ball make you powerful Is
there something going on
 The three you just named
 I mean it sounds like she wants this
thing
 Wait are you saying the MisSteak like a
good filet mignon or like a mistake
 Oh thats a good point
 Maybe we should talk about the whole
Nicodranas thing really fast
 I dont think any of us did Can we return
back to your hometown ever again after that
 I feel like we might need to drop some
 Also we have a couple of members of the
Mighty Nein that seem a little bit disparate
 Ill join
 I maneuver to the other side but sit
leaning up against the ship out of it but here
 As they walk away and since Caleb
wandered up Do you truly believe the amount of
justification you were just doing for our
actions
 Everything we just did Definitely had a
long string of sounded like convincing yourself
and maybe the rest of us and I just wondered how
much you actually believed it or how much youre
trying to convince yourself that you didnt fuck
up real bad
 Okay thats great
 Its not our home but does that give us
the right to shit on everyone elses
 All right Okay I dont know Im not
looking for answers
 Eh people can adapt
 Its just that Ive done a lot of
shitty things and Ive made a lot of shitty
choices and a lot of mistakes and after Molly I
told myself that I was going to try and not do
that as much but its fucking hard
 Can we justify murdering six people to
have Jesters mom be a little bit better off
 Okay yep They attacked us And I walk
away
 Yeah
 Uh
 Conflicted I guess
 I dont know Look I know we reacted
accordingly and in selfdefense but we probably
could have a been a little bit smarter about that
entire situation
 Its been a fucking day
 In a part of myself Im a little mad
because I dont know Everything that tortle was
telling us about Marius and how he hangs out at
the docks and waits until midnight and Im like
 What a random fun guy just hanging out
by the docks at mid I dont know everything
about that should have connected in my brain
that
 In a fucked up way I can actually relate
to that quite a lot For me Ive always had my
fists and man is it way easier to solve
problems when youre beating the shit out of
somebody
 Like we were justified in our actions
 Yeah
 Jester had a good talk with him I think
hell actually be okay We might need to do a
little bit more maintenance I feel bad Ive
treated people like shit my whole life And having
one transformative moment doesnt mean that youre
immediately going to be a different person
overnight and being better is something you have
to work at I guess
 I can understand taking the easy way out
with the power that you have Its what Ive done
my whole life I just dont know anything else
though
 Walks away from us
 Ive driven most people in my life away
from me Hearing him talk like that its not the
first time Ive heard those things and I dont
want to drive you guys away I dont want us to
drive each other away  Anyway
 Is there any damage whoevers there Is
there any damage control we want to consider in
Nicodranas before we fuck off forever
 Standup comic
 This has turned into a resource
management game
 Lemonade Tycoon
 Oh
 Yes lifeboat Is there a
 Or we could just leave the boat out in
the ocean a little bit and take the skiff in
 Super into it
 I have a thought There was something we
used to do and sometimes Id get hired to do in my
town A little bit of subterfuge If we wanted to
try and
 Well this ones a little bit more under
the surface
 In fact quiet is the key We used to do
little whisper campaigns
 Just going into bars pubs Start talking
a little bit loudly about the pirate crew and
Captain Jawgrasp and the hell that he unleashed on
the docks the other night
 Fuck it hes dead Yeah
 I dont even think wed throw our name in
the mix
 Never mention ourselves just
 Build a narrative Start talking just a
little bit louder than what you should in public
Maybe whispering to some bartenders
 Well my thought was if we split up a
little bit you guys focus on hiring a crew
someone else focus on spreading some words
 Can we slowly in shifts navigate towards
a cove
 Fuck me
 Sounds insane
 We can always pull in the ship really
fast to load on the crew and then peace out
 Lets sleep So tired
  Yes
 Youre asking everyone Oh no
 Not for the Mistake
 Maybe burn the flag
 Ooh
 Jester you have a disguise kit right
 Would you do my makeup for me Could you
disguise me
  Whisper campaign
 I thought we fixed did we fix that Did
we fix the black sphere
 We always make these plans and then
abandon them
 Good call
 I hand off  gold to Caleb Here Heres
for hiring crew
 Youre with me on the whisper campaign
 Thats what Im talking about
 Can you be a cook
 Wait are we at a bar or something
 If we stop at any bars along the way
 whisper campaign
 Okay Ill do deception Natural 
 I disseminate that these ruffian pirates
coming in messing up our nice and peaceful
Nicodranas again I heard it was that Captain
Jawgrasp He came in and he deceived his own crew
and he murdered them all in a plot of vengeance
and greed and then he took the boat and he went
off on his own
 Succeeded Yeah Were already great
 Yeah Oh yeah
 It was so dark but the sails seemed
black like the heart of Captain Jawgrasp
 Just like his soul
 Yeah Maybe this We got to come up with
something better than greenskinned dwarf Thats
not a real thing
 Ooh This is getting so complicated with
each layer
 She drove the captain mad with the
vengeance
 Yeah Now her spirit lives on and she is
haunting sailors looking for her longlost lover
 Im just saying Spooky coincidences
 We once again put misinformation out
about the boat
 I think it was Orly
 Lets go get Orly
 Should we say Were The Mighty Nein
we met you the other night No maybe not
  A week
 Yes
 We did it
 Can I assist him with counting as they go
by
 I keep sharpening it and its just
shit
 Mine and Matts wedding rings are rose
gold
 Take your gold and leave
 Well I mean it looks like theres not a
main trade route
 Both hands or just one
 Yeah We have a thing
 Caduceus do you actually even know what
youre looking for
 So you came with us because we thought we
were a sign
 And now youre looking for the next
sign
 When we fully get out of the reach of the
land by the way as were sailing away I just
want to keep an eye out on the horizon and be
 I throw some dead pigeon or seagull in
the air
 Nope Seven
 Ill go
 Individually yeah
 Perception

 Jesus

 Sorry
 Thats because Ashleys not here to roll

is it fucked Just with a quick glance
 They look like theyre still going for
it
 Okay Im going to run over and try and
collapse the sail So its not unfurled try and
collapse it I dont know if thats the right

 You know that video of the monkeys
throwing the raccoon
 Thats what I imagined
 Is there anything in the sails Any
flags iconography
 My perception checks have been garbage
Six
 Werent we on boats for our first Gen Con
liveshow
 Thats actually a good thing We were
trying to figure out what to wear
 We do the cast of South Pacific

 Sleeves are so big Shit I think that
was an eight
 This is not a good dice for this
lighting 
 I lost another fucking owl goddamn it
 How far would that rummaging entail Just
curious how far you would look
 Yeah yeah
 I second that question
 Well I want to figure out if shes just
another matchmaker or keeping it for herself if
that is a thing
 Aw we forgot Marius
 Were not leaving though were not
leaving anywhere Theyre going to fix that ship
 Well okay but still why would we run
if we dont know what this thing is inside of you
Im assuming you want it out of you right
 So we just need information and then we
run
 Shit were supposed to learn from these
people
 Are there like portcullis windows Is
that no Are there windows
 Does she have papers and shit
everywhere
 While theyre having a conversation I
want to do a scan and see if I can see any
floorboards that look like they can be popped up

 Avantika
 How can you be certain that youre the
only chosen one of Ukotoa
 Do you see why we did that
 Do you often wake up vomiting salt water
Do you have wet dreams

hired We totally murdered all of your guys so

 Jamedi is that Cosko Is Jumanji
 He makes a note every time

be doing something
 Yeah white noise
 That means everyone heard Beau and Keg
bone is what youre saying

 Well look I mean Jester gets visited by
the Traveler
 Yasha has thunder
 She has dreams and visions maybe you
guys are just special or whatever the fuck they
tell people

 I mean look
 Avantika seems like shes had this gift
and these visions for quite some time Maybe you
could learn something about yourself Talk to her
a little bit
 Hell yeah man
 Yasha you look trepidatious
 I disagree
 Yeah we did say we were going to get
better at that
 Chick ah chick ah
 Thats good
 You are a walking hazard right now
 No look Im not shaming you for that
Im just saying maybe we should put the black
powder in the haversack

 So eyeball hand you showed her yours
 Was she I dont know did she say
anything else about
 Yeah and theyre all keys to the temple
 Also Nott said that theres like a fuck
ton of gunpowder under the ship so
 If she has a sphere and can talk to the
serpent gods Im assuming she has some sort of
magical powers like you have magical powers She
has cool robes and is wearing an amulet that just
screams magic
 The flirt talk
 I mean he also had that allseeing eye
on his back right
 I mean eyeballs We all have two
Theres a lot of eyeballs around Just saying
things have eyes
 Just trying to be skeptical
 Yeah
 Deuce has a point theres got to be a
goal at the end of all those powers right
 Did she say anything else about what she
wants
 Jessie are you all right
 Youve just had this like really angry
face in the corner for a little bit
 No it looks like the third pencil youve

any type of dreams whatevers going on its not
normal I just want to point that out
 Look we can know just like I know about

can just keep that on the down low right Im
interested in knowing about peoples shit not
exposing it
 One eye open
 Oh and you think you do You the
authority on knowing what other people want
 Yeah Me neither

 Weve heard Fjord speak with a lot of
different accents
 He clearly had some sort of fucking
dream We know that
 Hell tell us when he wants to tell us
all right
 Well if youve explored it why dont
you tell us whats necessary to bring
 Okay well then go on What
 Hmm
 Is this not ringing a bell for any of
yalls Snake people temples the naga We
already fought them Done this once before Think
thats where we got the little sphere thing that
went in Fjords thing had a little circle with
like a pool in it and you could see shit
 All right but hear me out Because we
fought those people in the swamp they were the
merrow people right Maybe theyre still
worshiping the same type of serpentine deity
 A lot of different people takes a lot of
different types
 Thats what I just said
 Yeah
 Thats what I was totally going for
 Thank you
 Ill be behind Jester
 Ill be behind Jester yeah or with
Jester
 
 
 Did you get a haircut

 Jackpot
 You got any of that rogue shit
 Hey can you do that on multiple things

 Just a thing that was given to me
 A feather from Nila forever ago
 I dont know Im just saying it might be
magical
 Magic feather Maybe it makes me fly
 Oh thats right you didnt meet Nila

 Am I close enough to where I can overhear
this
 Sorry
 I go over to Fjord while were taking a
break Hey did you find anything out from
Avantika About you know shit that you guys have
in common
 Does she believe it though
 But does she believe that shes a zealot
like connected to some god
 How are you feeling from last night
Seemed like you had a rough night
 All right Did you ever read any horror
stories as a kid or did you and your friends tell
horror stories Spooky things
 You know how theres always a time where
the narrator stops lets your imagination run wild
with what happens
 I just wanted to say People might have
ideas and thoughts and Im trying to look out for
you because we said wed have each others backs
Sometimes the less you say the more peoples
minds like to fill in the blanks From what Ive
learned generally whats in peoples heads is
worse than the reality of the situation
 I mean look weve seen you do some
weird fucked up shit right
 So any time youre unsure its going to
make other people even more unsure with a layer
of suspicion Its like a tiramisu of confusion
 No pressure
 Lets go fight some snake people
 I agree And I walk up
 No why are you following me Why are you
doing this
 How many
 I duck down I turn to the rest of the
them Shields Weapons
 I direct the group and I say
 You flank
this way and then you guys flank that way We
flank around
  I tell them to hold
 We duck
 And watching So its snakes versus
lizards right
 Yeah
 We didnt punch our way through shit
 Oh my god
 I turn around and I say
 Do we have
anything that resists poison or venom
 Caduceus you raised your hand
 I feel like maybe with these people we
should have a frontline party and a backline
party And maybe a little frontline poison
resistance could be good
 No I dont mind going in front mainly
because I have no fucking range
 Can we do that
 But if we give the Were stage
whispering
 Just saying these guys clearly have
reach and I dont think we want to have all of us
tangle with them
 Youre so healy yeah
 Im not going to volunteer to speak for
anybody but I know Im better when Im up in close
 Could you give the both of us
resistance
 Yasha can look behind

 Its pretty high considering
 Oh shit
 Does this seem to be a lot of fruit
 Yeah

shield away from him but itll make him easier to
hit
 It almost is like hes meditating like I

makes me nervous about the water because what
could come out of it
 Can you pitch it to us in  seconds or
less

uselessly through water
 Uh huh
 Im swimming up
 Im going to spend a ki point to do Step

 You have five Total
 Okay what do I see Where am I Quick
look around
 The waters still filling
 Im going to keep moving upwards and
while Im doing that I want to take out the
foot rope we have Then I want to grab
something heavy that I have Ive got to have
something stupid and heavy that I dont care
about and I want to tie it to the other end A
crowbar I take the crowbar and then tie it and I
drop it down the well with the rope
 Uhhuh
 I want to take the rope and doublegrab
it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs
 Fuck Its locked
 Is there a key Wheres the key

 He selfishly wants the door unlocked
 Take one last deep breath Going to drop
down and going to use that nope the rope is
attached to me Going to drop down and see if I
can go for Jester
 Yeah can I take her and yank her up with
me
 Sure My last ki point
 That helps Whatever I can do I guess
 No you were below me I think
 Thats good Thats nice of them
  Oh god
 Take Cad take Cad Im good
 It ends with the mob of angry people who
want to kill us probably
 But I dont know if youre making death
saves Is he stable
 How the fuck do we get out of this
 Haul ass
 
 Turtle Its only a turtle
 Natural 
 Might as well go with the flow
 Keep moving
 Run
 Six rounds
 Is there anyone tracking us pretty
closely yet
 Im going to take the rest of my ball
bearings and dump them out as we run
 Nott do you have anything you want to
offer
 I dont know if any of my ideas are
good
 Ive got an oil flask I could drop down
some fire but dont think it would work well either
 I go
 Fluffernutter and take my ninja
star and go 
 I dont have fire I use my fists
 I could have used the bottle rockets
  I think these are magic
throwing stars I think I bought magic throwing stars
 What Oh jeez
 
 I have these bottle rockets if you can
Mage Hand them away and distract them away from us
with another popping sound
 Well I can light them you throw and
you take it further
 Okay
 Well call it
 Well gee when you put it like that
 I dont know I feel deeply shamed by my
suggestion now
 I know you just dont have a lot youve
used all those things
 Okay okay okay okay
  total
 I want to
 Were all clear
 At the rowboat
 How close are they
 Yeah
 Im on the edge doing polearm duty like
croc hunting
 
 Yeah Not feeling that whole time
 Ive never felt more useless
 Curse you
 Yeah
 Yeah do we just collapse
 of exhaustion as soon as we hit the
deck
 Oh cool
 Yeah
 It got uncomfortable
 You have clothes underneath your
fiber
 Little hearts
 Sorry I thought that was hypothetical
and that we were talk about that later which we
should do
 Ill be right back You guys find a spot
Ill meet you there I go back and I go
Jeremiah Give me that I take bread or whatever
he has prepared
 Yep Jeremiah
 Hi Beau
 What do you have right now Something
ready I want to chew on something while we talk
 Thank you You have sausage to go with
that
 Water Wine
 Thank you sorry Im just hungry as
fuck I go back to the group
 I got appetizers There you go
 What the fuck actually happened down
there We havent really gotten a clear
description and were all confused
 Yeah we saw them
 It connected to the pillars and then
thats when everything started flooding Then it
was just running for our lives at that point I
dont know I didnt see much else
 Theres also the temple where we found
this thing that had the snake the naga
 What was the one that was inside of you
Is it the onyx one
 It was the amber one Oh shit
 Is it the same color
 So in the amber it was the giant serpent
with the tidal wave
 So three murals Three creatures
beings Three chosen ones And three different
eyes in each
 Do I remember anything from hitting the
books in school of some gods
 It would be history and not religion
 Well theyre the same for me Same
modifier  Herstory
 Big kaijuskind of thing
 I say all of that I read this one
paragraph once and then the filigree there was a
monk with a trumpet up his ass and thats why I
remembered this section so well In fact still
remember the book Bet if we go back to the
library we could still find it and we could
figure out more about this
 Speaking of choice whats yours
 It feels like she has bigger plans
 The Divergence yeah
 Ive actually had a good time Ive died
a few times but Im great
 She also seems very interested in you
And dont get me wrong shes hot and all but I
question her motives Feels like shes I dont
know
 I agree with that and I think shes
understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon
 Oh thats fucking brutal
 I dont think theres anything wrong with
maybe asking for The Mist I think maybe Caduceus
has a good point if we can convince her that
were still part of her crew by doing our own recon
 We took all that time to learn how to
sail the damn thing
 Mmhmm
 Hee Thats awesome Speaking of trouble
are you going to take her up on that glass of wine
 That she has mentioned three times
  Fuck
 Make a constitution check
 Eyy
 Aw no what
 Cheers

 Its a d plus your constitution yeah
Wow thats a one Do we still reroll ones

face Im going to leave that here Were going to
cross out these doors None of it happened
 Oh yeah Do you want us to do that
 Thats rare
 As were walking over I whisper to Fjord
 Avantikas going to want to know about
that paintbrush
 Yeah but Bouldergut was there
 Bouldergut saw everything so unless we
want to bribe Bouldergut
 I have to pee too
 Thats so cute
 Wheres Bouldergut to me
 Okay
 One less pirate and one less shipper
trying to prove himself a hero Thought he could
stand up to the lot of us
 Well we didnt kill him but we
definitely embarrassed him thoroughly something
that I find some men find worse than death
 I heard there were some very good
tropical fruits super rare in this crate Based
on what I found  Good meal later on
 I slip her  gold
 Im not Im trying to Oh my god are
you serious
 Oh is it
 Thats still not great
 That brings me to an 
 It is a one Nope its a one
 Fucking hole in my pouch Shit how did

 Captain Tusktooth
 Sorry Quartermaster Tusktooth formerly
captain for us
 Anyway it was a good day
 What are people doing
 We act casual
 I sensing my biff casually I turn to
great was that
 So impressive right
 I fucking right Saw that adrenaline
pumping
 Anyway good day man I go downstairs
 Im trailing them
 I try to find Caleb They do that
 Genuine question
 have you been telling
this story the entire time Ive been gone
 Thats great You know what I have
something I think that you would be deeply
interested in maybe
 I didnt Fucking goddamn it
 I didnt find fucking books
 Okay books cats I get it thats so
good Love your fascination of both the most
boring things that I can think about including
books and cats But lets go look
at something awesome
 Just keep your mouth shut for like 
damn seconds
 Follow me
 We bring him to them
 Shh come in shut up Did anyone follow
you
 
 Do the thing Figure it out
 Yes Just not about cats and books
 In the meantime Im like
 Oh my god So
what happened Is it like a tattoo
 When are you going to do a tattoo on me
 I opened the box This is the paintbrush
and the ink
 Caduceus detected magic and it was
glowy
 Thats what Im saying so I need to
figure out what it is
 Ive had an idea
 For just a little bit So this is going
to be stupid
 Youre not fucking
 The Not There Fairy Not there
 I have this idea because Molly on the
back of his coat his neck his tattoo
 On the back of his tattoo he had an
allseeing eye and I just I dont know I
thought it was really cool I feel like it could
be cool to have it on my back right below my neck
 Yeah
 Oh yeah maybe it would like I stole it
from him
 Yeah you know hes dead so whats he
going to do
 Well do that later
 Yes I was so hoping for this
 Isnt that an old Chinese folklore a
magic paintbrush
 Its the magic paintbrush
 Haha dick joke
 This is a real conversation we actually
need to have with the entire group present
speaking of
 Except for Fjord
 Yeah I feel like before port We need a
plan before port
 I dont want to waste that
 We could just steal a ship
 Fjord
 Oh I was going to say
 I go get Fjord
 Casually but like I dont want to
interrupt like a cocktail party
 I do the
 When youre ready just clicks
tongue Just where we are
 Technically anyone can use a shield
but if youre not proficient in it
 Because weve just covered this in our
Handbooker Helper episode
 Uhhuh
 I told him When youre ready this is
where we are
 I have a lot of ideas
 How do you feel about floating dicks
 All right
 Of course
 Wow
 I mean it feels like a bucket list item
checked off the list but there were several
times that I might have questioned everything that
we were doing
 I mean we just had the full pirate
experience that a travel agency could not provide
It was very authentic and that was amazing
 Huh
 Down To Fire
 Still having those dreams then
 In a good way or a bad way
 Or is it dependent on the operator
 But you think that one of the others
spheres is at the bottom of the shipwreck Not
necessarily a temple
 But you
 Fjord and he traded it for power
 Well at least she would be twice as
powerful as Fjord is one
 I mean theres also
 Which is inside of you
 Uhhuh
 Yeah
 Do we  need more
information
  To find your ship
 Sotto
 I was debating heavily in watching
Avantika to see if with a distraction of trying
to board the pirate ship today that I can maybe
sneak into her office with the distraction But I
noticed she was very adamant holding back and
watching the entire scenery It was not safe to go
into her quarters If we need to get into her
office I think its going to have to be an
important enough and big enough distraction
  Youre doing great
 I think if we dont do anything it means
your eventual demise
 Unless we beat Avantika to the punch
 Oh is that it Is that our meeting Okay
yeah
 Yeah because I volunteer
 You want me to help seduce Avantika
 All right
 Oh Its early
 Its four oclock
 Okay
 Im going to make some barrels
 What
 What does that mean
 Is there like an Advent calendar
 Less than a year
 Yes queen yes
 Fucking triangulation shit
 Because we were over here right In the
reefs Ukotoa
 I mean if its a triangulation
 Well this is where were going
technically this is the shipwreck
 Right This was where we were
 Theres another reef here
 Then theres Torrid Reef here
 Do you know in which direction the ship
was heading
 Maybe he knew where to go and he was
heading there to get his gift
 Said Beau in a morning breakfast
conversation or something
 Oh my god
 If someones allergic theyre fucked
yeah
 All of us
 Weve seen this before
 Okay
  not natural
 
 That sounds super inviting
 Dope
 Wow Okay
 Oh no
 Oh my god Marius
 Yeah
 Marius the Mariner LePual
 Le
 LePain
 LePual LePuain I dont know Thats all
I got
 Oh Caduceus the Juices
 How do you mean
 Okay Yay Yeah
 I guess well follow
 Mm do we live with plans
 We had a vague idea
 Dont we need to pay them more
 Whoops
 So by touching down on the island you
become a member
 Were a part of The Revelry
 I dont know if that was the easiest
membership Ive ever obtained or the most
difficult membership Ive ever obtained Its kind
of hard to say
 Thats for him to do
TRAVIS No For me to do
 Its for the quartermaster He said divvy
up treasure
 European British giant shit
 Hear hear
 Im Beau Some call me Tracy
 Disdain for organized crime in the
Empire
 Oh yeah
 Do you have a favorite cocktail at the
Bloated Cup
 A brew or
 Right course you do All right bye
 Roof snipers
 How much
 I yank away from him Move on
 Am I that transparent
 How much on average do you pay him to not
kill you
 And if you didnt share your spoils
 Right
 Theres a war on another continent and
were not a part of it
  Ukotoa
 Her crew
 And were headed there
 She fell down the stairs you guys
 I catch up to her a little bit Hey
Avantika
 Weird question
 How much do you know How do you know
how to give a certain amount to Avantika Sorry
the Plank King Freudian slip
 Its very intense
 So its less like a government and more
of a union that you buy into
 Like a union with a dictator
 Hmm Do you ever think you could make a
good union leader
 Huh
 No
 Who needs aspirations
 I would love for you to tell me about it
someday
 Deal
 Might as well go to the pub
 First drinks on her
 
 Do it
 Im the worst influence Im going to say
do it
 Yes
 Whats Avantika doing
 Is that Blues Traveler
 Where that mug came from
 Caduceus how much is salt worth to you
Like on a scale of money to nothing
 Sure
 Hes Bruce Wayne Caduceus Wayne
 I elbow Fjord and I sit down next to
Avantika
 Sorry excuse me sorry So Avantika
Whats next for The Squalleater
 What What did she say Havent heard
didnt expect this what
 I immediately grab my purse and hold onto
it
 The thing I imagine most adventurers
have A little coin satchel
 No not a Dolce  Gabbana no Not a Kate
Spade
 No there was a discussion Its coming
 Yeah or Sophie Its always a Sophie
 If theres not  people that pop out
behind this curtain Im going to be disappointed
 Her lantern light
 Yeah I heard something about a ring and
treasure in her eyes
  hours
 Ooh night walk
 Oh I forgot
 Good night
 It feels pretty public
 I need to pee Anyone know where the
bathroom is
 I was already on it I respond back in
Halfling
 Mmhmm Jester
 Do you have a pen and paper I could
borrow
 Sorry got caught in a language loop Do
you have any pencil and paper or pen and ink
 Just like a scrap thank you I scribble
Meet in the alley on the piece of paper Is
there an alley Im assuming theres an alley
behind this
 Meet in the back alley To be
specific
 Will you go with me to the ladies room
so we can powder our noses together
 Lets go powder As I walk out I shake
the piece of paper thats folded very tightly
 Give her a wink and walk off
 I go and I walk out Shell read it
right
 Lets go around to the side of the
building
 We are a hundred percent going to take a
shit in the alley
 I go towards the back alley
 I show Nott where to take a shit I wait
either for the rest of my friends or for Alice to
eventually read the damn thing
 Allison
 It works half of the time
 Its super awesome
 I just want to figure out what her beef
is with Avantika Maybe she can be our key
 Yeah
 We can get information from her first We
dont have to necessarily always give information
upfront to get information and we can always lie
 I am
 Yeah
 I feel like thats slightly underhanded
 I dont break eye contact
 All right
 
 Im sorry
 Or just saving your life
 Nott will you stand guard now because
now I have to take a shit
 Its been that long
 Two more minutes
 Okay what was your question
 All right lets go
 Night walk Night hike
 Ive got  gold on that
  Mermaids
 Night hike Were all here
 Dont worry about it
 Were looking for fresh air
 Gauge it as it comes
 It is
 We should get a wig for the Judge like
the Plank King has
 Yeah
 Just throwing it out there
 Yeah whos watching
 This is the Revelry
 Shes kind of like a Tiffany
 That makes it clear
 We call it the
 The Apricot
 Wait is the Apricot this or is the
Apricot the tiny Tiffany Ship
 Its this okay
 Holy shit
 Im keeping an eye open for every
suspiciouslooking asshole
 It feels like a farmers market It feels
like certain people sell things whenever they got them
 Okay
 Do you have a powerpoint
 Mmhmm Well I think its less about
getting off this island without Tiffany and more
about getting to that shipwreck first before
her
 Bitch
 Well shes not currently at her ship
Im assuming a lot of her valuable information is
locked away in her captains quarters somewhere on
Tiffanys ship If we can get the information to
the next apricot tree then do we need Tiffany
anymore
 How far
 Thats a lot of feet So many feet Look
if Ive learned anything about important people
its that they cant resist putting shit down on
paper I guarantee you theres something in her office
 Do we have credentials Do we have like
badges Like beepbeep
 Oh can you
 No I want to get something
 Tusktooth
 So many nicknames
 Personally I feel more comfortable with
Honda controlling the supply of apricots than Tiffany
 The tree we just came from or the tree
that were going to
 Fuck asking Tiffany any questions We
break into Breakfast at Tiffanys and get the
information that we need
 Eyy this is my specialty
 No comment I plead the fifth
 I think to get in yeah
 Also you said there was a balcony
right
 Was there a door to the balcony Do you
think that would be locked
 Or to Avantika
 I mean Tiffany
 Fuck We were doing so well
 Whos here
 Do we need to have Honda distract
Tiffany Can we not do this right now while shes
theoretically sleeping
 Thats true he could be accountable
 For sure busy We could have this guy
with Frumpkin making sure that theyre busy if
youre comfortable with that You dont have a lot
of a choice
 This is my forte man
 Okay
 But if Im with the queen then what does
it matter
 I could take the thats a good point
Fuck
 How are you going to get off the boat
 What are me and Cad doing
 Cad can you go with Honda
 You have to be nearby
 Can we
 How about this
 Caleb and Caduceus and
Fjord youre one team You have Frumpkin watch
Fjord you give me the word when its good to go
Ill deliver that to Nott and Jessie they go
 Ill give you the signal you guys go
Ill be nearby Ill distract any guards if need
be with my feminine wiles and then you let me
know if theres any emergency
 Then I will have no means to communicate
with anybody else but you will
 Actually thats a good point How far
away is the Bloated Cup from the boat
 Oh thats amazing Cool Perfect
 Good It might be our downfall but its
great
 Okay so Ill try and be within eyeshot
of the Bloated Cup within eyeshot of you
 Oh hes been in my
 Sorry I dont
 To get out
 Here I slip Caduceus a few of those
firecrackers that I have
 How long will that take
 Break
 This is either the best plan or the worst
plan
 Its a great plan
 I turn my cloak insideout to the
inconspicuous side and case towards the docks
and start casing the area for Revelry that are
guarding the area or potentially a good place
for them to do the thing
 
 Do I see anything that looks like it
could be a potentially good area for them to cast
a spell without being noticed
 Okay I block around as to not look like
its going the same way that I just came from and
catch back up with these two With the
detectives
 All right theres two guards casing the
dock and two of Avantikas Tiffanys people on
the ship It looks pretty open we might want to
find an alternative for you guys to not be noticed
as you do the crazy magic thing
 Its super open two guards guarding the
dock and two people on the deck of Tiffanys ship
 To then bamf over Our quarters in the
 Okay
 You guys are going to have to talk to
guards and convince yourself on the way in and you
will be noticed
 Were talking about two different things
here
 There are two guards guarding the docks
there are two people on the ship of Avantikas
bo of Tiffanys boat On the de You get what
Im saying The deck of the ship Of the boat
 If you all want to just walk on to your
quarters you will have two guards and two of our
crew members who will see you walk on
 We hide somewhere and were never seen at
all and youll bamf in Unless you disguise
yourself as Tiffany now Then I would say we find
a hidden place potentially in our private
quarters in the Bloated Cup that you bamf into
 He said it was within 
 I will be nearby near the docks Signal
if you need me
 Good
 Yeah for the deception
 Someone do that
 Before they leave and we all go our
people love to have safes but they love to hide
stuff in the walls of safes like false bottoms in
drawers Stuff like that
 False backs to safes So even if you get
in and you think you find everything double and
triplecheck all right They love to write shit
down Im telling you its there
 Thanks
 Was she not complimenting me
 Just go steal from rich people
 Cant hear from the blood pumping in his
ears
 Im on my way towards the docks
 Yas queen yas
 Youre staying in between Im heading a
little bit further The daisy chain
 So you guys to Beau to Caleb to Cad
to Fjord
 I can hear you I have responded to this
message
 Fuck Yes
 I signal to Caleb that theyve made it on
the ship
 What What would investigation have
been
 But youre a badass rogue
 Come on
 Oh my god youre lucky
 No Im daisy chaining to it I give you
a signal
 No me We already went through this
 The daisy chain
 I wander like a drunkard past Caleb and I
 While he is being a creepo I go over to
the two guards on the dock This drunk piece of
shit over here he tried to attack me
 So guy who was left that guy is an
asshole and whats with that guy that just got
stabbed I feel very unsafe
 No Im just saying
 He tried to I think rob me I thought
as a pirate that I had immunity to that I dont
know Im just trying
 Actually technically Im new Great to
meet you
 Sure Lets go
 Youre fucking welcome Go go go go
go
 Why did I get arrested
 You shot me
 I say
 Sup Waynen
 Im with Avantikas crew You can ask her
if you want but I dont think you really want to
Pretty sure shes above your pay grade am I
right
 Great fucking intimidation Nine
 Thats right
 Oh Im sorry Are you afraid Im going
to stub a toe in the middle of the night
 Beau never does
 I just go
 Oh fuck I just keep walking
like I dont know who they are and I pass by them
with a glance
 Fuck you

 Not to the boat Never to the boat
 You saw a lot of shit go down at the
boat
 Sup guys How was your night walk
 Shh Whos around
 Whos really drunk though Is there
someone real drunk
 Is anyone real drunk Look real drunk in
the tavern
 That was part of our crew Part of the
Squalleater
 Jesus Thats a natural one
 Oh sorry Its a four Ten
 Oh Whatshisname
 I sit down next to Waldok with another
drink and hand him a drink
 Holy shit man I am so sorry we couldnt
have been there to protect you from these attackers
 Whos the other guys name
 Im sorry we couldnt have been there to
protect you from Zoen What a dick I mean we
were here all night fucking trashed so If we
had only been there
  Couldve been better
 We were drunk Here
 We kind of stagger a bit though
 Look for invisible peoples in the room
 Fucking fuck Seven
 I look over his shoulder
 I know Deep Speech
 Oh
 Thats pretty awesome
 She is a bitch
 Oh shit
  Yes yes it could
 Its got the apricot tree
 Nah
 Holy shit
 You got a book
 But you still get a book
 You still get a book though Thats what
I was saying
 Mmmhmm
 Between apples and peaches
 I agree with that
 Yeah
 We dont need to take that to the Plank
King if Caleb knows the language
 Why She could ford anything that we
want Forge She could forge
 We have her signature lets forge it
 I probably would have Yeah
 So by the way I got tapped on the
shoulder by the Plank King Hes looking for dirt
on Avantika
 I know Totally mindblowing I know you
had no clue
 I dont think we need to do that I think
we just drop it in the Plank Kings
 I think we copy the contents of the
book
 Thats what Im saying we copy the
contents of the book
 Sure as long as you think itll last
there
 I will say the Plank King offered me
some good cash to rat out Avantika
 He was literally asking for a snitch
Now
 No Nothing about any of these people is
honest
 I know what to sign
 Just write it up and Ill sign it
 Ill simply sign it with
 How much
 To go with the package
 Mmhmm Unless we want zero
implications
 We need the Mist
 No no no Hes saying we send a cipher
and a translated page with the entire book
 So that they can then take the time with
their smart people to translate the rest of the book
 No he knows the cipher
 Correct
 Theyll be able to tell unless we do
Jesters hint where we Mend a few pages and get
rid of some ink
 So lets just do that and the rest of
the plan stays the same
 Break
 Itll wake us up So whos guarding
Caleb
 Yeah
 Whats that Where is that

 Okay what are we going to do
 Can we send Frumpkin now with the
package Just send him now out the window
 Go Go Go go go
 Send it with the book
 Gee I wonder
 Oh my god
 Wheres the Mistake
 Im dying Ive never felt more in
trouble
 
 Holy shit
 The gauntlet has been thrown
 Not next week
 Eyy
LAURA Holy dang I should have kept those
jewels
 But we got the information we needed
 Info is golden
 Well the day after Thanksgiving on Friday
 On Friday watch us as bears Stealing
honey instead of very invaluable books and jewels
 It felt like getting called into the
principals office Youre like Fuck
 Thats fucking rad Kill some bitches
 Hang on 
 Can you Im dying I might be having a
heart attack Beau reaches around and scuffles
Im sticking with the plan
 Yes Im going to grab it from you
 Then I look at Jester
 I cant hold a movement right
 Was taking the book an action
 How far away is Jester from me now
 I run back to Jester
 I say
 Lets get out of here
 Thats my turn
 Oh I could have done Patient Defense I
should have done it
 What did you get
 So considerate of you
 Oh my god
 Ill catch up with you
 Its you know We anticipated this
 Thats so punk rock
 Good Going to piss that guard off
 The tavern
 I want to go around and I want to go
straight towards the Plank King
 I go
 Jester Ill see you there I dart
by and I also want to burn a ki point to do Step
of the Wind and run my full foot movement
towards
 Can I say anything
 Okay
 Can the guards that Im near hear her
 Fight fight fight
 Dealing with that
 Wings on ice
 Seethrough Caduceus
 Getting weird
 Yeah
 Natural one
 She went to public school
 So did I

 We all have average intelligence lets
be real
 But she believes it now How long does
she believe it for
 Okay okay A lot can happen in 
seconds
 Nine
 They all failed their save He thinks
that were the bad guys now
 Youre tiny Youre dexy
 Slippy
 I have requested evidence for the Plank
King He wants to see me directly Its Avantika
Theres a coup Shes trying to take over the city
with a demon god
 Not deception
 Persuasions not my best
 Okay  Above average
 Time is of the essence Theyre killing
pirates who do not bend the knee to her Ive got
to get to him now Let me pass
 Let me come with you
 I
wait
 Its so tempting Im so tempted to just
bust through there
 Hot
 Bling Bling bling bling
  Public school
 You have to stay far away from Winston
 I go
 See To the guards next to me
 Is it still alive
 I tell the guards standing next to me
because Im assuming they saw the explosion of the
each passing moment Will you at least walk with
me Time is of the essence here
 I power walk like a grandma at a mall
 Its 
am the doors just opened
 Got my insoles
 Its a box set Its so fucking hot
 Go to your local game stores Support
small businesses
 When are you going to be rich son
 Thats the one I got Its so pretty
 So cute
 It was a Gwar concert
 What On your buds
 Sup
 What the display you just saw or this
 I think you just won the lottery friend
I toss him the book
 I know Luckily one of our crew members
is smart enough and he deciphered the whole
thing In there youll find everything you need to
know about the coup that Avantika has been
planning Whispers about wanting to rule the sea
She has been worshipping an outerworldly being
called Ukotoa left over from the Betrayer Gods
 I didnt attack she attacked us first
 Youre going to trust the things that she
says Youll see a U burned into the deck of the ship
 You have time to read that book right
now
 Hey you came to me though Why
 What do I get when Im right
 How about we strike a deal right now
Because when you go down there youre going to
see murdered crew mates and a U burned into the
deck of that ship from where she was trying to
summon Ukotoa
 
 So if you think you can trust anything
that she says before you get into the details of
that book details that weve already deciphered
as weve been on the seas with her for quite some
time and the betrayal that we have seen
 Thanks Thats not the first time Ive
heard that
 Hey I want a boat and safe passage out
if were correct
 Deal
 Theres a cipher in the front
 Yeah its pretty good work right
 I told you yeah
 Hes our Solon
 Well were from Wildemount Hired
mercenaries from the Empire Im with a secret
order of the monks from the Cobalt Soul known as
the Expositors Avantika has been a person of
interest that weve been wanting to investigate
for some time and I was sent to do that So
unfortunately our business has nothing to do with
you fine folk here of Darktow It only has to deal
with Avantika Shes disrupted our shores enough
We decided to investigate
 My allegiance is completely separate and
isolated from any persons here My allegiance is
with the Cobalt Soul
 
 My voice is shaking Im so nervous
 Mixed lies or halftruths
 Hmm So you have your library card
 I do and Jester does
 Yeah It takes me literally punching the
shit out of Avantika though
 Before she 

 Go for the temple
 Yeah I have all of my ki points left
More or less All but one Yep
 Mine Im assuming which is  Hang on
Features and traits
 Yeah 
 They are unable to speak a deliberate lie
for one minute and all charisma checks have advantage
 You have  seconds but I have more
knuckles
 Oh my god
 Will do good sir
 Should we try to take them
 Yeah we know how to sail now
 Yeah lets go
 Like investigation style
 Ooh you are turning me on right now
 Yes
 Yeah check for traps first okay
 This just turned into a resource
management game
 Im having an adrenaline crash now
 Are those little zoomy magnifying
glasses
 The crew got them That was Max Thanks
producer Max
 Bye Frumpkin
 I dont know if I rolled I dont think I
did
 Im in there too
 I was going to say teddies but
 Chanel No 
 The maps the stuff behind her charting
out where she was going anything in there
 Its on the way
 Any supplies list Any inventory
 canvas
on board things to make supplies
 Chocolate dipped strawberries
champpagnay
 Yeah its been a while since just the
three of us have been in a room together
 What Youre jumping around so much
 Shes quite pleasant actually
 She might be better than both of us
combined
 Which part difficult Losing his fuck
buddy Its not that difficult
 Of course its minimalizing have you met
me Everything I do is minimalizing
 Yeah
 Yeah what Caleb said
 Yeah how do you know
 You want to take a guess
 Its very romanticized but on that note

Caleb do you think you could recreate that cipher
that you made and have one on hand
 Id like a copy if you dont mind
 Got them right here Nott Just these
No that wasnt working No All right Yeah its
a little true but not as intense as you think
 Monks
 Expositors
 Yes
 Kind of new to it all to be honest
 Speaking of time that it takes to travel
are we sure that Avantika was the only one who was
interested in what Ukotoa has to offer
 I guess what Im saying is are we still
going to be competing against others once the
Plank King successfully deciphers that book
 It does kind of sound like a wives
tale
 Lets go talk about it with the others I
think
 Mended over this way
 The boat or the island
 With our shit all fucked up
 Its a cleric oh god d just went
flying
 Is it an event each day Does the crew
come out and we all join Like Yeah
 Exactly
 And lets go
 For the boat
 Until we find it
 I dont know Maybe thats a team
discussion
 There still begs the question of is
someone else going to come looking for this Now
that the Plank King
 We gave the book with the cipher over so
if anybody else wants it
 We did Oh my god
 Come on
 Druids can teach it too
 Oh wow How far does your octopus
connection go for
 Yeah but how far is your connection
 Maybe hell see Dashilla
 Youre in my ear Ow
 Do you ever feel like your relationship
with your cat is hindering building stronger
relationships with human people
 I feel concerned about you sometimes
 Could we give ourselves some weights to
get us down there
 Concrete shoes
 We should have weights that weigh us down
there
 Wont you crush under the pressure of the
water after a certain point
 Oh yeah Thats a good point
 Caduceus you making breakfast
 Ill get up for Caduceus breakfast

ship thats not because of natural causes is
there something about this area that freaks people
out or something
 Do we feel anything Does it feel weird

 We found a Twiggy
 She was hiding
 She stole this

 This ship

 Where are you from
 Youre a gnome right
 Dont gnomes live for a pretty long
time
 So you could actually be fairly old
  and look pretty young You dont know
You dont know how old you are
in shadow I could be  years old but when I step
out into the light its like seven
 Fascinating I dont think shes as young
as she seems
 He has an octopus
 Interesting
 Was this in Port Damali
 Yeah it was super freaky actually
 Im a little confused at your implication
as well
 As Fjord gets the boat going I follow
after Fjord
 Do you need help getting the boat ship
sailing Ship moving Whatever
 Am I the only one thats not beguiled by
her charms Twiggy
 Me neither Anything that cute
 Have you ever noticed that pomeranians
are the nastiest dogs youve ever met
 Theyre poofy Theyre super adorable
Theyll eat your face
 Thats a solid option Like a Plan D
 She definitely has some magic
capabilities She cast this illusion that made her
hand look like it was extending I think it was
supposed to be cute but you know that uncanny
valley It was a little weird Its unsettling
 Hey I have another question
 Since youre captain now right Youre
captain
 Will you train me to be your first mate
 Really Okay
 Yeah okay
 Deal
 Sorry again for being a dick I think
Ive been a little bit on edge with the boat
 Its really just a kneejerk it wouldve
happened if it was anybody You couldve been a
scarecrow and I wouldve been like Fuck off
bro
 Okay lets go
 It actually works pretty easily You just
add a line and then you paint over that
 I agree with Caduceus
 These are registered deadly weapons
 Actually going off of that because I
meant to do this last episode did Avantika have
anything fabulous in her wardrobe
 We were opening it up
 I take one of her darker overcoats
 Jester gives us a fashion show
 Are you still learning tattoos from
Orly
 And his first mate
 So it creates things It creates money
it creates gems and it creates holes to
 Welcome to The Mighty Nein
No Thats not how it works
 Do it again
 Nott
 Do you want to go in a hole
 Its still a foot
 Well he says it lasts a minute
 When weve timed it
 All right Ill do it
 Yeah
 Caduceus grab my feet just in case
 Just grab my feet
 Drop me further
 Goggles yeah
 I grab a few
 Pull me back
 What is my face
 It was super dark I hit a barrier It
felt like it was a barrier of stuff
 Oh shit
 Do we know what language that name hails
from
 It was cloak and stuff
 It was cold in there I dont know Hes
saying that the staff heats his hands and there
was a cloak Maybe wherever this haversack was
from
 It feels like someone was raptured and
were stealing their stuff Thats what it feels like
 I go to Fjord Youve told us about the
Halas thing
 Is this perhaps something to do with Sir
Cadigan and Port Damali stuff Do you know a
Cadigan Would I recognize the name Hadigas
 No Halas
 To see if this is his old stash
 Thats absolutely horrifying Ten
 I mean youve mentioned Sir Cadigan
being a big old meanie several times What did he
do Did you witness something
might be like this because of him
 It was Hala
 Like one of those bomb shelter walls
 What if you unleash the wailing creature
and we have to deal with it
 Its survival
 Ill take the gum Im not proud
 This is some Bones shit
 I dont I think Well talk later
 Thats what I was going to ask Its a
forceful darkness and looking at Fjord get
nauseous does this remind me of any ghostly
presence that I experienced before
 Oh my god
 
 Ill be after Fjord
 Is there any scripture or writing on
the
 Yeah to like enter this door
 Natural 
 Is there any image in the stained glass
 I think were about to enter into
someones study
 
 Oh shit
 Dont fuck me Gil
 
 Thats actually yes
 And where is that amongst the planes the
little ruby amongst the sea Is it in between two
certain certain planes
 Oh shit
 What
 Are you serious
 Why does this keep happening to you
 I was actually technically watching from
downstairs
 Shut up
 
 Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet
 Man some days you lose some days you
beat a cabinet

 I look over and I go
 Theyre fine and I
go upstairs with Jester
 Nope I dont give a fuck right now about
that cabinet
 Oh it moves Now I care a little
 While she was doing that I was like
 I
feel like I saw him look over here somewhere So
over here yeah
 Hes gone
 Yeah he was looking in this area He was
like Ah and then I feel like I saw his head go
over here But then the bookshelf was in the way
so I couldnt see what he was reaching for
 Natural  Thank you Gil 
 Feels like something recent
 I think I know what Fjord did Hey
Caduceus
 Or Caleb
 Can either one of you put light behind
this stained glass
 Backlight it
 Caleb
 Yeah I was going to say I have a
feeling thats where Fjord is I think he touched
this thing which yeah
 I mean
 Its maybe the way out
 Or somewhere else
 I want one of those
 While they all do that I go
 Im going
to see how Fjords doing  and hit the ruby
 Oh Sorry Oh shit
 My actions affect other people Fuck
Ill run up and touch the same spot she did
 Oh no
 Youre good 
 This feels like a lot
 
 I turn to Jester and I go
 Fjord just
this works I take out the red elemental gem that
Ive had for a very long time and I use it I was
going to say I smash it but then I felt that
might be deeply irresponsible because then it
could just smash
 Badminton
 I go
 Fuck him up
 God well I think its one of those
things where if something bad happens it turns on us
concentration
 Yeah if I lose concentration but I
dont know
 Okay What do I thats not good
 Nope I did when I was a druid
 I can also use DD Beyond
 Search Whats his initiative

 Who saw me bamf out by touching the
thing Jes for sure did
 And Fjord Okay
 They didnt run
 You had to have seen Caduceus
 He said Were running its bad and
then jumped into a sphere Thats some childrens
cartoonlevel obvious
 Yas queen
 Im a dummy
 Get out Jes
 Youve got to run Just run
distraction
 Run and pray
 She can go now if he uses his reaction
 Jesters next right
 Mmhmm and  hp
 Last man standing Twiggy

 How many hit points did you have
 You would have been gone
 To get the reaction yeah
 That was Nott the Bravest
 Aww Jessie
 What Are you serious
 Sorry
 Thanks Twiggy Im sorry I found your
cuteness alarming
hood up and two little Twiggys stand there and go
Bye bye
 Well that was the weirdest seven days I
didnt know I had
 Jester are you all right
 Youre a bad liar
 Sure
 Hey Fjord
 I feel like theres this trend of us
feeling shitty after we come out of a fight
 Hmm
 That was a dragon I dont even know what
any of it meant
 Well I guess theres still time to
figure it all out
 It feels like that gold was stealing from
the dragon just slowly but surely
 Yeah Anyway But hes dead now so
what does it matter We could just slowly drain
it Its like a neverending piggy bank
 Thats true
 I guess Im going to stay up I dont
feel like sleeping just yet
 Copy that captain
 How are you
 Oddly I feel okay too
 Is that wrong of me
 I feel like everyone else feels so
terribly
 I think I oddly feel the most comfortable
when things are a fraction away from going
terribly wrong
 So did you
 Who brought a fucking parrot Damn it
Jester
 Perfect timing
 You are a bit handsy sometimes
 I mean its hard because I do pretty
reckless things I dont know I honestly feel
like everyone feels terrible about how that went
but you know when you look at on the whole we
did okay
 I believe her actually
 Yeah Honestly man when you did that you
were totally alone and by yourself It took us a
minute to figure out what exactly had happened and
what you touched
 Jester
 I hope you know my intention wasnt to
abandon anybody especially not you I thought I
was going to have to activate the damn sphere and
it was going to open up a portal or something I
didnt know it was going to immediately take me
away from the fight Im sorry
 I mean I might have a part in it
 I think thats true
 I agree with that
 Thats a good point What do we want
 Yeah Get off this godforsaken boat for a
damn minute
 Okay Do I show them how Am I first
matey enough
 Youre talking about Bisaft
 Wait the Xhorhasians snuck under the
mountains and attacked Felderwin
 I frantically search for a bill that I
probably dont have
 I look at the dockmaster I go
 Give me
the bill
 Youre taking care of all of it Did we
have any
 His Grog is showing Was there any money
left on the ship from Avantika
 So all the money we have is pretty much
the money we have
 Fjord
 We might want to consider having a
communal ship fund Well talk about it later
 Breakfast Caduceus
 Come on youre a foodie
 Yeah how much is a bottle
 I think he wanted to try some mead I
wanted to try some mead and then we wanted to buy
some mead
 Mmhmm
 Beau
 Benth can I call you Ben
 Bentha Pleasure
 Could you get it
 I took  if you want to take the other
five
 Nothing
 Just one
 You found us again This is the sixth
time You just know where we are
 I know but she was just were in a
restaurant
 This is precisely why we didnt wake you
up
 Right yeah
 I pour her a very large glass of mead
 
 We were going to go on a winery tour
 Fjord what was that naval officer
 Sorry What was
 What did that naval officer say to you
about the war What was I hearing
 Does that freak anybody else out
 Its not far from my hometown either
 From Kamordah

 Yeah but he said that they were
traveling under the mountains and Kamordah is a
mountain town so
 They got under the mountains and attacked
Felderwin
 I think we should still go to the temple
though
 Well Im just being paranoid
 So we find the temple and then what I
guess go back to Nicodranas first yeah
 Yeah we Yeah
 Id be mad at us too
 Oh Yasha
 Its the next sedan coming out
 He decided to take some personal time to
himself
 Oh a Tuesday
 She holds up a handful of shreds Just
fucked up
 Im getting poor you guys Im getting
DD poor
 Do you not have bees in Xhorhas
 Oh Yeah right
 Shes been collecting all those flowers
 Do they have mushrooms
  gold feels like a lot right now Just
saying
 
 Each one is a Fireball
 Fucking score
 I go over to Caduceus and I pull him
aside really quick
 Hey Cad I have a thought
 As you may have heard I have now become
first mate
 No really No one told you
 Sure
 I probably have With that
responsibility I started thinking about the crew
and maybe we havent been treating them the best
that we could be You know I think theyre okay
I dont think that were abusing them but maybe
neglecting them Anyway I got this extra bottle
of mead for them and I thought maybe with some
of the stuff we got maybe we could do a nice
dinner for them or something to just show our
appreciation
 I really dont want to get stabbed in the
middle of the night is what Im thinking so its
a little bit still selfish But really dont want
to die by one of these fuckers
 Oh a card I didnt think you think
theyd appreciate that I could write that down yeah
 Good call
 Thanks I feel like a first mate should
be astute
 It does you used it pretty correctly I
think
 Deductive reasoning youve got it
Nailed it man yeah Good work Okay Im going
to go now
 I start prepping the boat
 He did
 I was waiting for your response
 I pay attention
 Damn could you be more ominous Orly
Were you trying I think he was trying
 That was good I think that was pretty
good
 Yeah I was almost like
 Captain
 O Captain My Captain
 Do you need me to stay up Captain
 Before I go to bed I would like to talk
to Jester unless Jester is having some alone time
and it doesnt seem like its the right time
 Oh youre here keeping watch Thats a
good call actually Going to stay up much longer
 Yeah Motion sick
 Its a little spooky right Its fun
though Listen I wanted to talk to you for a
moment Im not really good at this sort of thing
but about what you said last night about being a
good liar Youre right You really are a good
liar
 Yeah I think it takes one to know one I
think being a liar means when I know youre not
does that make sense
 And when you are Look we all get sad I
want you to know that I havent told you really
any of this but I also had a lonely childhood
 Yeah I didnt have a lot of friends My
father was very protective because of certain
things that he believed so I wasnt allowed to
have a lot of friends Really any friends
 Maybe Maybe I would have turned out a
little bit more like you I admire that in you In
my loneliness I got angry and turned to bad
things but in your loneliness you turned to
creativity I think thats beautiful I really
do
 Okay
 Really I dont think Ive ever seen you
angry
 Id like to see it someday
 Ill be proud of that too Anyway I
know you like to look for friends I dont know if
Im best friend material That might be a lot of
commitment especially with my commitment of being
first mate
 It really is but you dont have to look
far for a friend Anyway Ill leave you to it
 I hug her back from behind
 Love you Jes
 Dont stay up too late
 I head to rest He gave me permission
to
  Celebrate
 Sentinel bitches
 No we just got that repaired
 Merry Christmas
 Sup
 What
 Okay
  The Cadence family
  Yeah
 I was awake the whole night
 The one were heading in Fjord which is
the only way we could be heading
 Towards our destiny

 Orly which way are we heading
 Towards the islands
 Thank you
 So we just painted it
 To be fair hes eaten some balls
 You busted a ball
 Thats true Im telling you its a
ballthemed year
 Sorry
 You are searching for this based on a
vision
 Fjord there are presumably three
spheres yeah Right
 You have one You have two and then
Avantika Im checking if you think that this
could unleash Ukotoa
 Okay What if theoretically playing
should make four one extra just in caseies
Vandran has that one but hes also already put it
in the temple and this third one could unleash
him
 Maybe it only takes three
 Its you Am I doing this
 Ill aid you
 Are we in the middle yet
 No carvings in caves holes in the stone
walls
 Did you go underwater in your vision
 Sorry Go Frumpkin go
 He made it worse The water here is
pretty clear
 Why does this keep happening
 We just woke up
 Jagged tower seem familiar
 Okay
 Me and Caduceus again
 Want to do separate rolls this time
 Fucking horrible
 Eight
 They were like 
 Do you have the ability to let us breathe
under there
 Its cold already 
  That was for the crew
 What Nott
 Your flask is bottomless
 Do we see her go and sneak the mead
 If Ukotoa decides to show up
 Whats the plan
  Okay
 Still cool

 Can I because Ive got shit when it
comes to range cheat the distance and see if I

 While they do this Okay 
 While you guys sink I went and peeked
through one of those windows and looked down

 Pop pop Sentinel
 Well natural one doesnt and a natural

 No I rolled a natural one
 Yeah I rolled a nat one and a nat  so

 Everyones at such a loss
 I thought he had his little moment with
the little quick goblin
 You said you used the initiative of the
one that died by accident It was coming up on
this turn Its all on one round was what you said
 Because I tried to do Sentinel on it
 Okay
 Dope Im going to do a kick off the
ocean floor and Im going to jump I want to do an
aerial over the two of them to land towards Fjord
As Im upside down in the air Im going to take
my two attacks
 So dope
 Im going to go for the one thats not
stunned first
 Come on Thats good Thats a  I
really need to do math better  plus
 
 Yeah and then Im going to try and stun
him
 Oh Nine
 Jester sees an arc of my blood through
the water as Im bleeding and I cartwheel
 Second attack Im going to go to the one
thats already stunned
 This is just a straight roll right
 Ive been using my fists as magical Wow

 Double that to a nice awesome two Six
 My crit was less than my

 Mmhmm
 Right behind Fjord

 Oh my god
 Why does this always happen to me Yeah

 No for the disadvantage first attack

damage No sorry seven damage Three plus four
Then the next one is missing definitely missing
with a two
 Yeah I guess Ill just punch it one more
time
 Yeah Through the crowd grabbing its
hair
 Jesus I dont think thats going to do
it either unless 
 Yeah
 Fucking onehanded bandit
 Does this look bad
 I would like to go in and find a little
bed of seaweed and lay down for a minute
 Is anybody against a short rest
 Im pretty tapped on ki points and
  blood
 Thats old business Weve seen that
one
 Are you doing your thing No
 Copy
 Theyre this big
 Yeah I have a weird question because you
became a champion after well you became a
champion and Avantika was a champion When
Avantika died someone else become the champion
 He got one ball We put in one ball We
got another ball He has two balls
 And were about to put another ball in
there
 Im about to do that
 Yeah The feather was
 Caleb are you going to Identify these
things
 Well the glass sphere makes me nervous
I feel like I heard of things like this before
 Can I get a closer look at the skeleton
with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable
 No iconography No identifying symbols
 Dont fail me now Okay 
 Thats a good point
 My brain went super elaborate and thought
that this chamber crushes people if you fuck it
up That makes way more sense
 Oh man Reverse cowgirl death
 While all that was happening I was
picking up some platinum and gold that I found
 Combing the silt and Ive got the
armor
 Good luck captain
 I look at the runes in the armor that Im
holding
 Ill wait
 
 Just the three of us yeah
 So
 How do you feel
 Like durian fruit
 They smell like rotten flesh when you
open them
 Do you like durian
 As a first mate
 Do I get a dope first mate kit like a
spyglass
 Can I use the spyglass
 Oh I absolutely  and then
 Yes Argh Just straight perception
 Okay okay okay Wait what
 This literally happens to me so much
Thats better 
 And you said they werent flying colors
 Okay I turn around to Fjord relay that
to fire
 Im so happy
 Its a ship fight Im getting
emotional
 I thought was she the boatswain
 I dont know Who did the ropes and the
sails
 Wait I have this written down
 No youre a carpenter The boatswain was
Caduceus
 At least it was
 Oh because youre the master gunner I
see
 Hang on were digesting
 So we can do two of these right Thats
what you just said And the master gunner
 Its legit a minigame Its Pillars of
Eternity you guys
 So the captain the first mate and the
boatswain each have access to two special action
options described below
 Options Full Speed Ahead and Fire at
Will And then the master gunner has access to the
Pack the Good Powder special action
 Can we do each of these actions on our
turns or one of these actions a round
 You said run I think runs a good idea
 I think they wouldnt be here if we
didnt have something that they want
 Do you want to roll initiative then
 
 You want to do a hard degree turn If
we do that if we turn starboard side we can try
and hit them with our starboard cannons
 If I remember you could do a few
different things You could whirlpool
 Fire
 They might just be pirates
 Were thousands of miles away from
fucking Wildemount
 Captain I would like to point out the
more people we have to bring on board the more
people we have to feed or if we dont have enough
food
 We have enough food All right
 Sticking with it
 Sorry
 Theyre pirates
 I have a feeling Darktow would side with
these people
 Youve gotten good at those
 Right this way good Levar
 Work it work it work the gangplank

 Would I know that as first mate
 No for supplies
 I hand Caleb the leather armor as well
 Mmhmm
  silver
 
 I would like to point out that maybe we
should set a little bit aside to
  pay the crew
 Everyone took a second to be like
 Well I dont know I cant speak for
Caleb the other empire kid
 Huh
 Hes busy
 Im from Kamordah
 According to the information they came
all the way here to Felderwin which is where Nott
is from
 My concern was that they mentioned that
they used mountain passages If you took this
mountain passage all the way through Felderwin
you would go along this route My concern was that
you could easily go east in that path and hit
Kamordah I dont know
 I have no desire to go rushing back to my
hometown I think Id prefer to go back to Zadash
and check in personally
 What are we going to do to stop an
invading army
 I dont know I honestly dont even know
if theyd believe me if I told them to run so
whats the point Maybe we could better organize
our efforts together in a larger city like Zadash
or go check in on Notts family first
 Actually I got a note from my parents
when I was at the Cobalt Reserve at the Cobalt
Soul It seemed very clear that they didnt really
want me to come back My mother actually ended up
birthing a son while I was at the monastery so
they got what they wanted Got rid of me and
thought that it would be best if we all parted
ways I took that letter as a goodbye and decided
to continue on my way
 I have a baby brother that Ive never
met
 Nope
 I dont know I guess I never thought
about it like that I never met the kid Its hard
to feel concern about something you have no real
personal connection with whether theyre your
blood or not I dont know
 Yeah
 I guess he could be okay I dont know
Anyway what about you Nott Are you here
 Yeah I think so
 Should we go check in in Felderwin
 Interesting point though We forged
papers for the Mistake correct
 Do we have papers for the Balleater yet
 Ownership slips
 Might want to make some more
 You made the first one pretty good
 Well touch on Nicodranas forge some
papers check in with Mom From there head
towards Felderwin
 What exactly happened down there by the
way
 Are you afraid
 Are you in the slightest bit concerned
that Ukotoa might start speaking to you and
putting more ideas in your head
 Hey what does your falchion look like
Still have the eyeball in it Is that still there
 Cool that was my favorite part It
wouldve been sad if it went away
 Were going to go check in on Felderwin
 Time might be on our side Going off of
Jesters point a hundred years can sometimes seem
like five minutes for these godlytype beings
Maybe hell be content for a while
 Can it change colors
 Whats the other thing youre keeping a
rock thing
 Whats a lucky rock do
 Does it allow you to reroll things like
the lucky feat Said not as Beau just as Marisha
 So whats it let you do
 Not generally
 I like full range of movement in many
things that I do
 Oh fuck that would be great to have
 Everyone else can do that already
 Thats what it is Its studded leather
 Pretty much everyone can disguise
themselves
 I was thirsty
 For  hours
 Yeah thats legal
 Yeah did you learn how to do that from
him
 I tell Jester this My parents when they
were trying to form me into a functional member of
society thought it would be a good idea if I got
into jewelry making so I have a jewelers kit
 I could crush gems yeah Just throwing
that out there
 Just a light Divination
 I would like to go to Caleb really quick
copy of Avantikas code for me
 Can I get it
 Thanks
 Yep I go to my chambers and for the rest
of the time I want to try and memorize her code
 Okay At some point in time like halfway
through I go back to Caleb after  hours with
I figured it might be useful because you know this
code You memorized this code you have a
photographic memory I figure if were ever in
trouble we can write messages in this code Not
too many people know it
 Yeah Ive been doing that
  Will you help me Tutor me
It might go a little faster
 Okay
 I do
 I think I just got his name as
Wharfmaster Male dwarf
matted beard thick gold hoops
 And I brush my hair
 I grab one of Avantikas coats
rip the sleeves off of them put it on
 My kind of woman
 Ill go to the blacksmith with the guys
 Whats your name by the way
 Dreef
 Beau
 Yeah Like a staff
 Yeah I do actually
Do you sell staffs
 I know
 Are you all really just making
this connection Really
 Pull out my bo staff
 I put it away and I smack Fjord
in the face as I put my staff back
 Your lips bleeding
 Thanks
 Yeah its a little poofy Yeah Thats
a good one man I had good aim on that
  So tragic
 Sam attempted to have a dad moment
and it failed
 Its a very unhealthy relationship
with pink
 Yes beat me to it Yes
 It would have been so cool
 Yeah it wouldve
 Just you know as a
historical landmark
 Like a dick
 What happens in the cold
 Its just a Players Handbook
 What class do you play
 Weve got a little bit of time We still
dont know how to get into this tower Maybe we
could do a little bit more research before
the night is out before dinner time
 Ask questions I dont know
 Ill chip in for one  gold
 Yeah lets buy them out
 Two hours
 The Wayfarers Cove The Open Quay
 What do you mean Its not there
anymore
 Did we do that
 I dont know
 Yeah could you get stuck
 No doors nothing
 I get this feeling that this is all a
forced perspective thing like an illusion What
if we get in there and its actually just a
shack
 Maybe hes an enthusiast of tiny homes
 Compensating
 I dont know Just a theory
 I mean what do we want out of this
right
 Yeah but then what To immediately be
arrested and thrown out of Nicodranas
 No there definitely is Its called
breaking and entering There is a rule about that
 Whats it sound like
  Walking casual
 Hello
 With Yussa Yussa Errenis It would be
really fantastic to talk to him
 Yes Or at least if you can inform us how
to make an appointment
 Maybe its his assistant
 Listen Im sure youve heard about the
war thats happening in the Empire
 We have reason to believe that people
with magical interests might be threatened in this
time of war and having heard that Oohsah might
be a man magical prowess we thought that he might
have some information or at least we could hand
off our fair warning
 What was your name
 Tomorrow morning
 Yeah it turns out you could just knock
 We talked to a little goblin accountant
dude Made an appointment for tomorrow morning
but not really an appointment an offthebooks
appointment
 Toss it like SeaWorld
 Sorry it shouldnt have come out of my
mouth Its inherently untrustworthy
 Yeah honestly it was the path of least
resistance that surprised me as well Im used to
things being difficult Maybe I just make things
difficult
 Maybe Im having a moment of
selfrealization
 Anyway
 We have a ton of magical secrets
 We have the Happy Fun Time Ball
 We witnessed an attack on another
wizards tower in Zadash I wasnt lying when I
said magic people might be under attack
 I know
 I dont think we have to offer the
dodecahedron either We have our eyewitness
accounts of
 Dont get me wrong Caleb is very smart
I know we all know that
 But you guys have noticed hes not
necessarily the best talker right
 Well you can justify anything
 I feel like were bonding Why have
you never told me this before You should
have led with that
 Is that bad
 Dope
 Yeah appointment in the morning
he said come back in the morning
 We told him it was an emergency
so we still have to go forward with that
 For you
 But what is going to be an
emergency for a man thats not threatened
by the things that youre threatened by
 Is no one into talking about the
tower getting attacked in Zadash
 We could just make nice
conversation and ask for a book Oh god
Im starting to sound like Caduceus
 Look at the end of the day this
guy has access right Making him our ally
in some way could come in useful even in
ways we might not be aware yet
 Shes so poignant when she speaks
 Well this guy is antiClovis Concord
so I dont know I dont think hes
 I have a feeling this guy is a
bit of a rogue agent in terms of Right
Because the Clovis Concord Sorry a
little repeat of the Concord
 Theyre like the government
for Menagerie
 Like an oligarchy
 Theyre anti this guy because
hes outside of their
 I just wrote down the chagrin of the
Clovis Concord so Im assuming thats what she said
 Jester
 Its an emergency
 Earl Grey
 Natural one We dont have Earl Grey
 From Zadash from the Empire
 Eliminate your enemies
 Maybe hell see us looking at it
 I look up at Yussa Is he watching
 I go in
 Before we went in I wanted to
can I bring Frumpkin
 Yep Frumpkin
 Give me Frumpkin
 Do you not want to see in this
 Fuck it Ill leave He wont give me
his damn cat
 Sure
 I deeply You have a morning routine
Oh thats impressive Sorry Deeply apologize for
interrupting Were from Zadash We are a hired
mercenary group here to deliver very specific
information from Zadash about an attack
that happened on the Zauber Spire
 Well it is a joint effort between
the Hall of Erudition and the Cobalt Soul
 A lot of people are banding together
now that war is on the home front
So unlikely alliances are happening
all across the continent
 Just a friendly passing off
of information
 Of course if you would like to
discuss alliances
 Yes I guess just a friendly passing
of information and that maybe you would
like to exchange information in return
if you might know anything
 Fantastic thank you Uh

 Trying real hard here guys
 Well as we mentioned the Xhorhasian
army has breached into the empire We witnessed
an attack from crick assassins on the tower
 Sorry He wasnt with us at the time
but the rest of us did witness an attack and
encountered the Xhorhasian ourselves
 Correct I see youve heard
 Beyond that weve recently heard
that the Xhorhasians have reached Felderwin
 Our group has been on the ocean in
search for further information on behalf of the Empire
 Youre not wrong We got word halfway
through in a jungle that a lesser god that likes
to go by the name of Ukotoa might have some
sway in everything thats going on
 I dont think so I think hes on
the verge of returning and I think there
might be followers and patrons who
might be aiding that cause
 We have reason to believe that
maybe some Xhorhasian spies and soldiers
might be worshipers of Ukotoa
 Weve received a vision through mystical
means that I do not feel comfortable sharing of a
potential location for where Ukotoa is captured
A jungle landscape somewhere on the continent
You wouldnt happen to have any ideas would you
 Okay
 Beyond that
 We found a thing
  Which thing should I
tell him about
 It was presented to us as
the Happy Fun Time Ball
 Stumbled upon us through a little girl
I think she thought it was a toy
 Seems like everyone is getting butterfingers
with their magical items or magical folk
 Do you not find it concerning
that the Savalierwood is on the
borderlines of the Xhorhasian Empire
 Mmhmm Yeah I actually knew that
 Im sure you have very keen eyes
and you saw the artifact that I was looking at
before I entered into this tower
 It appears to be a magical geometric
orb that has the ability to bend
elements of time and space and fate
 Ive seen into it
 We mentioned we were not
your ordinary folk So as you can see
things happen to fall into our lap
 We need allies
 As you mentioned we have very powerful
artifacts that were not very sure about But our
options are turning them over to the empire
which doesnt seem attractive
 Depends
 Depends on whos offering at the time
 Correct
 I know
 I tend to like fellow trustworthy people
even though Im not necessarily trustworthy
myself but ironically I fucking hate
untrustworthy people
So if youre down Im down
is what Im saying
 No I didnt say I didnt have loyalty
I said I had loyalty to these people
 Of course and I have a few slots
open in my loyalty bank so if youre
willing to pay the price of rental
 Yeah
 We all know corruption runs rampant
in both the Empire and the Clovis Concord
I dont want anything to do with that
I just want the truth
 This is not my fucking best Im
better at lying Thats not too bad 
 Did I Yeah sure
 The Mighty Nein
 Beauregard
 How about a nonmonetary exchange
 Do you have any type of scrolls
or spell books
 Or candy that you could lend to Calebs
aid further advancing his ability to learn that
 As traveling mercenaries
were used to being in danger
  It does
 Zadash After the Spire attack
 Either it was in the TriSpire
and they successfully exited with it
or the Xhorhasian were trafficking it
 Thats what we believe
 Yussa do you know of the Empire the
Clovis Concord stealing artifacts from other shores
 We havent showed
 Oh bourbon
 It sounds really good
 Its like a Red Lobster biscuit
 Some places call them lobster rolls
 Was it made of marble
 Thank you I could barely speak
I could barely get words out
 See access Thats what
I said earlier Hes smart
 You met a rockstar and you
look like you want to barf
 Access The international sign
for entrance for let me in
 Thank you
 It started out as a halftruth We got
there without exposing anything too deeply
 He might think we work for the Empire
 Oh no not like that Thought about
it though Worst case scenario flash a guy
see what happens
 I did tell him wait I did tell
him about howd you know that Jester
Am I talking about my slots too much
 Fuck
 Yeah Good with me
 Caleb
 I didnt lie to him Not really anyway
so believe what you want And I walk away
 If we go through Alfield we can
check in on our old contact
 Bryce
 Is Bryce in Alfield
 Theyre in Alfield right
 Sorry
 Oh no Yeah no We Yeah
 I forgot about this Weve done this
before
 The way you did in Zadash
 Okay okay
 Yeah
 Field
 Is that what we were looking for
 Yeah yeah yeah Costa rosta
 Nine
 Do we have anything bad
 And one of these nights
I talk to Jester
 You have that spell that you can talk to
people Send them messages very far away
 How far away
 Thats awesome
 I do Could you do one of those for me
To somebody Is that a thing you can do
 Her name is Dairon
 She was a roommate
at the Cobalt Soul
 She taught me a lot of
really great things
 I just want to make sure shes
okay because she got sent to the war
front on the Xhorhasian Coast
 Yeah I think shes fine She was
just there to check it out
 When we were still in Zadash Last time
that I was there I talked to her and she was
leaving and then went back and she hadnt
come back yet so its been a few months
 Shes got a shaved head and she
wears darkcolored clothes
 Shes got super buff muscles
 Cause shes been working out
 You know I Weve had good times
 I think thats just the thing
I have notes somewhere in here
 Yeah Im meditating on Dairon
and as I meditate I
 Hey girl
 Heading to Felderwin
 This is Beau Might be
heading to Zadash after that
 You know if youre in the area
hit me up
 Booty call
 Call me back
 Nope
 Oh right but she kn yeah
 Ooh Shell be gone for the next month
to the Bladegarden to help with the assault
 Shes in Bladegarden Narrow it down
 I told her that though before
she sent it that she was in Bladegarden
because I would have known that
 Just straight intelligence
 Lucky jade Okay okay okay
 natural 
 Shes got a longer nose pointed
 Fierce eyebrows
 Thanks Dungeon Master
 What Really I mean
 Sure
 What
 Oh okay
 Okay
 Really
 Thanks Jester Thats a big deal Okay
 What Me
 Yeah Sup
 What was that
 Okay
 Did he say something to you about your
past when you were in there with him
 You think he saw into you
 Youre a man of
 The man in Rexxentrum or Yussa
 Do you have to go or do you want to
go Because what Im hearing from you Caleb
is that you dont understand that you have
friends Were here willing to defend you
and kick some ass just like we did for Fjord
 Is it though
 Caleb unfortunately you dont
get to choose who cares for you
Its not a choice you get to make You can
either accept this
 What do you want We cant find anything
out if we dont talk to people if were not
careful I dont like not knowing either Caleb
Its why I thought I would talk to people
 I thought youd be excited I thought
I did a damn good job in there I thought
me and Caduceus both did I was talking to
Nott and we thought for damn sure that
you would be so stoked about this goddamn
fucking tower
 Wow  Wow
Fucking cool Caleb
 Yeah hes cool 
Youre cool Caleb See Jester thinks
youre fucking cool Because shes
your fucking friend
  Sorry Fjord
 Yeah do we
 Thanks
 Thats exactly what I think
 You wouldnt happen to have any
handwriting samples of some lawmasters
 I know But for more other ones
Other than you know
 Stolen mail
 Signin sheets even
 Great We dont have to arrest you
 Yep
 Yep
 Oh no
 
 Oh shit okay
 Caleb
 You recognize those people
 My notes look like a serial killers
Its bad
 Antiquity at the Cerberus
 Largemont
 Oh jeez hes Homeland Security
 Wait Archmage of what
 Fuck Domestic Protection
 Same
 I mean did you want to finish that
 I have an idea I have my opinion Im
just curious
 Someone was interrogated
 What was yours
 Nott You clearly have some
personal attachment to this
 What would someone want from here
 Yeah
 That guy mentioned people feeling slow
 Time Yeah gravity and time
 We have a beacon Yeah
We have a piece of dunamis
 I think Jesters right I think
this dodecahedron goes into that tripod
 I dont think we should do it here because
like Yussa said we pull this thing out selectively
 Your people
 Its because they havent
he hasnt in terms of
 Oh Wow yeah
 Can I actually do a little pass
on the chair and see if I see any signs
that someones been tied to it
someones been questioned
 Things that Beau would know that
people would do in her realm
 Aww Jesus fucking Christ 
 We already knew that
 Yeah I agree
 Fjord
 Someones come back in Whoever
 Well the chair is facing the chest
correct is what you said I mean look at the
amount of time that weve all lost staring in the
dodecahedron
 Nott
 Where do we go
 You said Old Edith
 I agree with Fjord I dont think they
necessarily found what they were looking for
when they came here but I think they
didnt find it and they might move on
 Im making guesses like the
rest of us None of us can honestly
tell you what the right call is here
 I think we all need to talk
 Sam Riegel
 RIP ears Dont at me
 Are we being followed
 That didnt count Thats good 
 Like a thousand
 I hear you
 You collected wax seals
 You still have those
 Thats cool actually
 Oh thats not I went somewhere else
Yeah married Yeah
 Nott I know this place is
 This place is quiet but do you actually
know if there a waterfall upstream a little bit
or a brook Something with some noise that
might drown out anyone whos listening
 Further off the beaten path
We walk upstream maybe
 Any babbling brooks
 Which is I think where
all those soldiers were going
 Yeah you definitely puked all over that
apothecary so its clear that somethings not right
 What is dunamis
 Lets find a patch of woods to hide in
 Does old Edith know your current form
 She just thinks youre not dead
 Nott you drowned You drowned and you
just spent three months underwater
Thats incredible I dont know if you
realize that but
 Loops into Caduceus social worker plan
actually
 Do you think Bryce would be down for more
responsibility and obligations
 Yeah thats true
 Plus Alfield is near the border and the
gates Shorter journey out
 Then we try to find Yeza
 Is it one word Pleasehelp
 Youre cutting out and I cant
 Leaving
 Are you listening to where you can
contribute
 Hey Jester
 Since were going to try and be honest
with each other and turn a new leaf
 Well in a way I didnt sleep with
Dairon She wasnt my roommate
She was my teacher
 I dont know why I told you that
 Yeah
 No I didnt sleep with her at all 
I totally made that up
 Yeah
 Thanks
 How to kick ass and take names bitch
 Yeah I dont know I guess its 
easier to pretend like you dont care
 Yeah Im a little transparent sometimes
 Thank you
 I mean dont get me wrong Id totally
tap that but
 You got this man
 Ew
 Mister Fancypants
 For the record Nott I dont think its
us thats been rubbing off on you I think its
you thats been rubbing off on us
 Do you care about us Youve told us
several times how youve been using us
 The dunamis
 Im curious as to how much was for the
Empire and how much the Empire was a veil for his
own personal exploits
 Trent Ikithon was looking at Yasha He
was sideeyeing Yasha
 I feel like Ive heard these words
before when we were in that bar He looks for
prodigies people with innate talent I dont
think it matters
 The Cerberus Assembly actually has a
pretty heavy hold on Rexxentrum
 Id be willing to lay money on it
 Nott
 Sorry you were going to say something
 All right I was going to ask you a
question I dont think you know the answer
 though Your son mentioned that a
mean lady with pointy ears keeps coming by
 Well if hes talking about Vess DeRogna
 It sounds like theyve been here watching
your husband for quite some time which means
checking in on your son
 It feels like it is a piece of dunamis
right
 Yeah and this thing that we had was
called the beacon Right okay
 The people that we saw fighting having
the DC fight in the air full on anime battle
did we recognize the because I know they were
wizards that were fighting the crick assassins
that were coming in
 Do we recognise the clothing and
appearance of the Archmage and Lady Vess
Is it the same people
 But the same robes
 Caleb you were in the library of the
Cobalt Soul when you stumbled upon dunamis for the
for the first time
 What were you looking for when you found
it What were you trying to find
 You still havent answered my previous
question of how you were using us and what that
means to you
 Her guns are bigger than mine
 Okay Was that a compliment
 Okay
 Thats what I was going to say Do you
think that Fjord was using us You think that
Notts been using us
 You know were also here volunteering
our help
 Caleb you were right when you said
earlier that its too late now That were involved
But I dont think we see it in the same
way that you do Its too late now because
whether you like it or not we all care about you
and are invested in you know your happiness
I guess So
 Dont run You can say you dont believe
in anything and thats fine Believe in us
just a little bit
 Im sorry for not hearing you yesterday
Honestly you saying that you dont believe in
anything kind of put everything into perspective
about that conversation I heard that you were
doubting me and us and our friendship
 One last time
 Yeah Yeah I have
 Caduceus is a wild mom
 So many wine spritzers
 Close
 Im going to button up and go
full Cobalt colors
 Complicated Is that what you said
 Poppy seeds
 Chamomile Blackeyed Susans
 I mean its essence of flower and bee
puke Its a miracle
 Well its more of a its fine
 I have this red feather from Nila
She was also a firbolg
 Well Yeah thats fair
 Would Nott know of a general physician
a doctor Someone
 Local doctor
 It said in those papers about them
being sick from the the town complaining
about sluggishness
 I want to find Demi Leric
 
 Hi yes Im Beauregard of the Cobalt
Soul Ive been sent here from Zadash
 If you have a few minutes I would love
to ask you a few questions
 Were taking statements from people
trying to figure out some incongruencies that
might have been happening over the past
few months
 Did you ever notice any increased amount
of patients feeling sick sluggish anything off
 Not the most recent two weeks
burntinafiretype of off Before then
 Wave of nausea Anything else What makes
you think that they were related as opposed to
general food poisoning What was strange
about them
 Did they all happen to live in a similar
area of town
 All in a cluster Sorry just taking
notes just want to make sure I get
everything correct
 Okay Anything else that seems like it
might spark your memory of being a little bit odd
 Mmhmm Did you know a man by the name of
Yeza
 Did he come in around that time with the
batch of people who were feeling nauseous
 It was all one day
 Do you mind if I talk to a few of
your patients for a second
 If you think of anything if you remember
anything I dont have a card but Im staying
Ill be in town I might be back
 Thank you miss
 Okay Im going to go over to one
of the guards
 Is the one whos semiconscious
conscious enough to speak
 I go up and slap one of his wounds
 Sup Names Beau With the Cobalt Soul
 Yeah Whats your name
 Good to meet you Jeff You patrol the
cluster normally
 You look pretty badly burned obviously
 I give him a little bit of my wine from
my wine pouch
 Sorry
 Sorry Demi sorry
 Jeff I was curious if you happened to
know what happened to Yeza Berdegerdeger
 Brenatto or if you were around when the
apothecary burned
 Oh
 Really
 The cricks got him
 Did you see which direction they ran
 Youre sure it was the cricks
 Okay Did you see anything else
 You were the one who got Luke out
 All right Anything else you remember
anything spark in your mind trying to figure this
shit out I know thats vague
 Did you feel like they were looking
for something in particular
Were they targeting places
 Okay Well look you did a good thing
all right man You saved a kid
 My friends kid I dont really care
about the kid but it was my friends kid so
here I pull out  gold throw it on the table
 You can split that up with your friends
or if you want to keep it I dont really give a fuck
 Yep Bye Then I run away
 Oh my god its big
 Its coming from the depths
 Just potential dicks
 Are we meeting back up
 All right meet back up I kick down the
Then I fill them in
 Apparently he was taken by Kryn
 I talked to some soldier boy named Jeff
 I know right His parents must not have
loved him
 He said four Kryn came in scooped up
your husband and ran off
 Yeah he was there He ran in and
he saved your son
 So much nature poop
 I feel like we shouldnt try and
assassinate the head of the Cerberus Assembly
not right now maybe
 We just made an alliance 
sort of with Yussa
 We could also go back to Zadash
 Are you talking about the thundery one
thats real loud
 It wont collapse the tunnel on our heads
when you do it will it
 All right
 Guys Hot take The Kryn arent the bad guys
 I mean aside from the mindaltering
magic that weve already mentioned all of us can
change our appearance Maybe what youre talking
about about them coming in and using the crick
maybe thats what they did Maybe they did your
exact suggestion first and they disguised
themselves to look like the Kryn and came in
I dont know
 Rexxentrum
 Yeah Doesnt feel like too many places
on the map are off limits
 Speaking of when I was talking to the
doctor Demi she said she had a few instances
over the last month or so where people were coming
in feeling nauseous feeling not like themselves
in a grouped amount of time
All from the cluster
 You want to head towards Xhorhas
is what youre saying
 Thats the thing Youre talking about
poking that thing The dodecahedron
 No
 Caleb sorry Caduceus Freudian slip
 You said the life force was being sucked
away from your grave from your home
 You said also to look for answers
though right They left first
 You have any idea which direction
they were heading
 You can speak to the Wildmother Youve
checked in on a few of our friends Do you ever
check in on them see what the Wildmother tells you
 I do
 Its a great name
 Geoff with a G or Jeff with a J
 Yeah sure
 Jester you okay
 Whats wrong
 I mean nice is boring after a while
 We can get to nice Right Eh
 Im sure theres some beachfront property
open in Nicodranas Maybe if we work really hard
and pool our funds we can retire
 You didnt get turned into all
the things that youre afraid you are
Its not how this shit works
 Do you want us to still call you Nott
 Nott and Caleb it is
 The Mighty Nein Made of seven people
Works great
 Nope
  Was the chair made by Geoff
  Something Dranas Ghor Dranas
 I am
 Yeah I know Whats Yasha up to
 
 Would I know anything about that
 What was it that those letters
were saying was under Ghor Dranas
Or they were looking for things
 I oddly feel more comfortable going to
Ghor Dranas than I do going to Rexxentrum
 I agree with what one of you said
 Mmhmm That once we get there were
fucking nobodies What are we going to do
 How long have you two been married
  Happy anniversary Right
 Thats what people say right
 Congratulations

conversation

walkabout

Mercenaries friends who are semitrustworthy
 I need an escort to take a couple of
people down to Alfield

conclusion later maybe

confident if we had a vague idea of a plan Dont
get me wrong super down to fly by the seat of my
pants That type of girl But sneaking in killing
people in the middle of the night two armies
fight getting captured these all sound like
real big stories
 I like that better Goats are weird
Square pupils
 Encounter worm

 Can I keep a lookout to see if theres
any markings on the walls Any signs of
directional type of code or language
While were walking
 
 I have a question for Caduceus
 Cad do you have any idea how far
underground we are
 Okay That was my question

 Ive heard of faery creatures I bet they
live
 Its seethrough on the inside right
 Ooh
 
 Underwater water source
 I look to see if theres any signs of
life any humans that have been here before people
 Signs of life or signs that
people have been here before
 Yeah campfires that have been
extinguished
 
 Just looking over his shoulder
 
 Its not but no one else spoke up
 So Cad Caleb Nott
 I had a screamer earlier
 What did you roll
 Oh we might
 Miss
 Ah yeah
 Just grappled
 Strength check versus their
strength check if I remember correctly
 No dont Please stop please stop
dont touch me
 It was so pretty when we slept in a
geode That was awesome Remember that
 Okay Can I get closer to the roper
 I was hoping he would do the reel
thing but to me because Id love to get real
 So I can hit it
 Well I dont know what else
to do but to wail on this motherfucker
First attack is real bad its a natural two
Next attack is not that much better  total
 Okay then I will reroll that one
with a natural one So thats cool
 Thats two attacks so far
 I rolled a two then a one
technically but you roll disadvantage
Does disengage count if youre grappled
 So disengage wouldnt help me
escape from it
 But I already used my action to
attack so I might as well Flurry of Blows
 Disadvantage on the first one
Nope thats a two again second one is
a natural  and a  bringing me
to a  total
 Its terrible Two Seven damage
I think I broke my wrist Then thats it
 Yeah
 Can I do the thing No I have
to hit twice Never mind nope
 Oh Can I do that
 Stunning strike
  There is a god
Okay thats my turn
 Yes she is
 Ah Doobah
 Thats the way it works
 Im still restrained
 Im going to stir around my stick
and try and jab it into his eyeball
 Wait straight roll
 Im going to get rid of all those
It never happened I dont think it worked
nope Thats a 
 Second attack
 Now its a  so it definitely hits
 That was with my staff I said
so its a d Seven points of damage
 Im going to restun it Can I
do that Stunning strike
 Okay Im going to move on from that
 
 Flurry of Blows Wait why do I
keep rolling twice I keep thinking
I need to roll twice Just once Ah
Natural  Its so manic but its true
 Doubling the dice Thats a three
plus a six so thats 
 Going for the uvula Last one 
 For this one Im going to try and
grab onto its tongue because I know
lot of blood vessels in the tongue and
start trying to rip it Another  damage
 I say
 Drop it Drop it
 Caleb do you have any use
for this Nott Nott
 Roper tongue
 What
 Im still throwing rocks
 Fuck 
 Kill it with cantrips
 No
 I havent seen any form of
writing no offshoots nothing like that
 Its more information which is
always good
 Hey guys Im just saying if were going
to be underground in a blank boring shithole
tunnel for a whole nother day I still have some
of these mushrooms left over from Mollymauk
 Might just help make it fun
 Im real bored
 Im just so bored
 Yeah
 
 Okay
 It already starts good you guys
It was a glistening night
 The snow fell on the winding paths
 It was chilly She could feel her
nipples getting hard
It starts so soon it starts so soon
 She felt the warmth of a fire She could
feel his warm touch as it was grasping around
 As his strong burly hairy arms
wrapped around her waist she could feel
her breath leaving her bodice
This is so good Jester
  Thanks
As she reached down
 Thats funny that was exactly
what was about to happen Im sorry what
Im going to I bookmarked it
 Is there any remnants of precious
metals coals things that would be mined
 Weve got to be right
 Would I know the exact boundary
line of Xhorhas between the Empire
Do they use the mountains
 If were under the mountains it could be
a long way up and we dont know what those
mountains look like I mean I dont know it also
could be fall and temperate and beautiful
  Okay heres the other thing
though sorry Im dying at the hammer
This is arguably going to lead to a nexus
right Like an entry point
 So whats on the other si Did they
build a military base around the entrance
to this tunnel system and is that
what were about to walk into
 If we go forward If we keep
following this is it going to lead us
 Yeah no I know I was just
kind of throwing it out there
 Thats a good idea
 
 Oh jeez
 Talk to them
tell them were friends
 Yeah bot
 Oh yeah
 You were just lifting so many
pebbles youll be great
 Oh man not again
 
 I will head forward
  but power walking
like a badass strolling behind in case
I want to deck some kobolds in the face
 What Why though
 Thats pretty good
 Youre just dangling
 Beware the spirit of the Maine Coon
 I jump down and take out one of
my shurikens and chop Caleb free
 Ah jeez
 Make big mess
 Ah its rabies
 The thing is going to die in ten more
feet from something else
 Lets let them do it for a little bit
 They might have useful information
 Oh so theyre not even
being secretive about it
 Got it
 You mean like as in
 
Hey We should go to sleep Like that
 My feet they hurt
 Because youre a god
 Im glad to see your
true form mistress
 Ill try to look for firewood
but Im so exhausted
 No
 Just visiting

 Im interested
 No thats exactly what he said
 Do you have bug allergies Oh no
 Have you been stung
 It works Its amazing
 Dodge those juices
 Wait like the green slime you have
right there in the
 Oh okay

 Would you like to follow us towards
the light at the end of the tunnel
 Im dying I am dying
 Is it obsidian
 Goodberries
 Stop I just got better
 We fulfilled our end of the bargain
I feel okay
 Were stealthing
Natural 
 And where are we
 So attractive so sexy
 I mean use a distraction
get them looking at something else
 I am a great sprinter like
real good  meter dash
 Right just saying
 Which cave Our cave
 Ooh Lava monster
 Would I know anything about giants
reading up on them or anything
 Cobalt 
 So probably not amicable
or prone to negotiation
 And they craft things so
theyre not stupid
 Averagely smart
 Yeah I read this tome once in
the library but I was a little distracted
when reading it because the monks had also
drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting
horns up their butts in the margins
It just happens yeah
 In the Cobalt Soul
