 And welcome back
 Weve definitely returned to the table
Thank you Sam So
 Thats okay So
 Everyone Everyone
 Welcome to Wildemount The year is  PD
or postDivergence This continent is divided both
by jagged terrain and political powers The
Menagerie Coast a collection of citystates
united under the Clovis Concord monopolizes the
southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount
thriving on open trade and cultural freedom
Beyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive
region known as Wynandir bisected by the
Ashkeeper Peaks Eastern Wynandir houses the
expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of
Xhorhas overrun with all manner of beasts and
terrors relics from the final battles of the
Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape
Northward you would find the Greying Wildlands a
lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it
unconquered by human hands However this story
begins in the territory of Western Wynandir
within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire
Emerging  generations before the Dwendalian
Empire has slowly spread to encompass the
surrounding societies of the region absorbing the
peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley
before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and
taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the
Empire
 No This is let me continue Under the
rule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal now in
his th year most are left to their own devices
You live as you did before The crown only takes a
tithe of what you produce and earn You follow its
laws worship its gods and bow to its installed
local leadership In return denizens of the
Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and
shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the
civilized lands This accord has led to a
prosperous century for the Empire or at least the
political elite Tensions brew beneath the
chafing watch of the Crowns Guard Every temple
is governmentowned and run and worship outside
the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment
Rumors of military clashes at the eastern border
near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge Our
story however begins much smaller Here in the
southern reaches of the Marrow Valley beyond the
entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge lies the small
rural town of Trostenwald Bordering the blue
waters of the Ustaloch this town came to
prominence near the turn of this recent century
when the surrounding fertile farmlands were
discovered to produce a unique type of grain and
wheat leading to a boom of breweries When the
glut subsided three large families stood
triumphant in the local business of fermented
delights Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports
of fish crops and ale Here in this sleepy trade
stop along the Amber Road a handful of wandering
destinies slowly begin to intersect
We begin in the early hours of the morning on the
day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor
of the Nestled Nook Inn A blearyeyed bruised
man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his
lengthy sleep catching his small snoring ally
curled at the foot of the bed Liam if you would
like to describe your character please

 And your name is
 All right As your smaller friend curls
awake Sam would you like to describe your
character
 Well Whats your name
 So Caleb as you come to consciousness you
glance over and can see slowly snoring and
rousing at about the same time Notts eyes blink
open her slowly groaning face looking over
towards you
 At this point you notice the gentle smell
of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge
and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the
subtle floor of your room meet your nostrils
 All right so you prepare yourself with your
mask set over
 Which is helpful The southern more rural
region of the Empire especially near Felderwin
which is one of the largest tilling and farming
areas of the entire Empire has a very heavy
halfling population And so while this city is not
the core of it youd probably see a larger 
of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling
So you pass off pretty decently as long as you
keep away from discerning intent eyes So the two
of you manage to gather your things for the time
being wander down the stairs from the top floor
down to the base of the tavern which the air is
already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of
travelers preparing to take on the days
responsibilities Yorda the something woman
barkeep with shoulderlength blonde hair and
weathered skin that you previously rented your
room at the inn from frantically darts behind the
bar while the redheaded barmaid rushes from table
to table It seems that the clientele is a bit
more than they were expecting this morning Yorda
yells from behind the bar to the barkeep
Adelaine two more brats and a bit of mush at the
corner table She looks up Im working on it
And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen
Theres a faint bit of music as two
slovenlylooking musicians in the corner are
trying to work for tips with a small hat on the
floor that it looks like nobodys thrown any coin
into it The tables are fairly busy except for
maybe two that appear to be available between the
two of you guys if youd like to find a seat
 Yeah you walk over to it you sit down

 You sit down and due to the chaos that
ensues around you it takes a little while for
Adelaine the redheaded barmaid to come by and
she scoots by the table Im terribly sorry What
can I get you
 I can get you all three its fine What
you want
 For breakfast I like you All right two
Trosts and a bunch of meats Be right back And
she rushes off she pulls her hair back and ties it as
she goes into the kitchen getting ready for the
midst of chaos While you guys have a moment there
at the table you can hear conversation muttering
around you and you have a brief bit of privacy to
discuss
 A short time passes before the two platters
are rushed over and scattered across the front of
your table with a clattering Pile of meats there
set for you a little bit placed on the side
because you might need especially with the look
on your face Adelaine gives you a glance and
goes Put something in your belly Comes back
and slides two Trosts to you
 As you guys are partway through your meal
lets see this would be Caleb You notice out of
the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door
looking kind of meek Middleage looks
workhardened He has a heavy chinbeard that is
unkempt and a bit wild but his eyes are warm
Hes holding his hat in his grip and he scans the
room with an eager glance before his face
brightens and he begins to push his way across
the room in your direction it looks like He
scoots over towards your table and as youre
about to turn and see what hes about
 he pivots to the table next to you
instead He turns to you three

 Yeah Youve met this man the day before
Rinaldo the fisherman who you had aided And as
he approaches he goes Might I sit please
 As he sits down in his chair I would ask
each of you to please describe yourselves
starting with you Laura
 All right And you
 Well get to that Thank you And Travis if
youd like to describe yourself please
 As Rinaldo sits down clutching his hat
still in his hands says I thank you for your
time Fjord And I apologize I forget your
names
 Beauregard And
 Jester thank you You all came when no one
else would yesterday and because of you my
daughter is still alive
 Oh thats okay
 Youll do well this side of the Empire
Anyway I wont keep you but I we spoke
yesterday and I didnt have much to give you
Sent you away with nothing but my gratitude But
Ive been asking around the other fishermen
lochsmen and weve put together a little bit of
coin for your troubles so And he turns his cap
over on the table and this catches your
attention you hear this clattering of coin Your
eyes glance over especially you Nott and watch
as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly
copper and silver pieces with a couple of
glimmers of gold and as soon as it clatters
across the hard wood table here in the center of
the tavern other faces begin to turn gather
attention as to whats happening over here in the
back edge and he takes his cap back and pushes it
forward towards all of you his dirty you can see
cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in
your direction before taking his hat and placing
it back over his head
 All over the table I hope its helpful
But thank you
 I would hope that is the case Anyway
Thank you very much I am sorry for getting in
your way And he stands up and gives you all a
nod and rushes out of the tavern a little
embarrassed by all the attention thats now placed
on him by the other patrons and as he leaves
everyone goes back to their business a couple of
wandering eyes starting to count what coins are
there as you slowly mitt them in your direction
 There are four gold pieces amongst the pile
 silver and  copper pieces
 Perception check  copper
 First roll of the campaign
 And thats how you start it All right
 This is going to go great
 While youre counting this out and figuring
out the division of your gains Fjord you glance
about narrowing your orcish eyes across the room
and you can see two other tables there are some
gentlemen who are peering over and as soon as
they meet your gaze they go right back to their
business and completely shrink away Theres a man
and a hooded figure at a table immediately
adjacent to you The man looks rather filthy his
hair a bit unkempt and hes trying to finish his
drink However the smaller halflinglooking
figure is just glaring intently and is slowly
leaning in the direction of the table
 This blueskinned tiefling suddenly leans
over to you at the table
 Make a perception check Beauregard and
Jester
 Okay The somewhat meek female halfling
whos now suddenly very reserved and not as
filthy as the human compatriot that she keeps
seems less and less halfling the more you glance
in her direction The ears are folded inward but
elongated the tinges of green to the skin and
with the little words that have poked through her
lips you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged
than expected of the halffolk
 Eventually Adelaine comes by and brings two
fresh Trosts to the table glancing about at the
unique tension in the air right here Would you
like anything as well
 All right pork it is Ill be right back
She rushes off to the kitchen You guys continue
to awkwardly stare at each other
 With your perception rolls earlier Yes
 She rolled a 
 No you heard the whisper youre not sure
what the words are You can see that theyre
whispering Being mysterious
 Make an insight check
  I mean seems to be genuine Hard to
read through all the wrappings shadow and the
hood still obscuring the face
 Yeah its this porcelain covering that has
painted lips Its a little unsettling
 As Caleb finishes oversharing
 At this point there is a bit of a commotion
towards the entrance of the tavern Two shadows
step into the doorway of the nearishnoonday sun
The figures one eclipsing the other from behind
begin to step in You notice one of them begins to
step from table to table glancing about with a
sort of grace to the movement the other staying a
few feet behind Taliesin if youd like to
describe your character please
 As this tiefling darts from table to table
a few feet behind you see
 You watch as these figures slowly move from
table to table the tiefling engaging in some
distant conversation leaving a slip of paper
walking to the next table Gauging the atmosphere
not leaving a slip of paper and quickly moving
on and then eventually your eyes meet what looks
to be two tables with a very motley crew of
individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their
own tension and currently trying to figure you
out
 Theyve completed distributing so you dont
see any coin unfortunately
 Okay He goes and sits down at this table
finishing his presentation One of the barmaids
comes up to you and looks up Youre standing
almost a solid seven inches taller than her
Miss can I get you a drink
 Coming right up Any preferences for the
family Baumbauch
 Husseldorf then All right Be right
back And she wanders off
 Mark down your two copper 
 So as he pulls out a small set of cards and
begins to shuffle them go ahead and roll an
insight check
 Okay so you get a brief conversation here
eagerness and the exuberant interest in just
getting in your face that this person wants any
fortune you tell will probably suffice Go ahead
and roll a sleightofhand check as well
 Yeah And you feel pretty confident that her
eyes are locked onto your eyes at the moment and
not the deck as you set up a proper reading And
the cards are shuffled set you place them before
you and you may give your fortune
 Make a perception check
  All right Everything seems pretty
aboveboard
 Sure
 Yeah easy enough Even with discerning eyes
at the table you are at the top of your game
 You may You lean back and subtly begin a brief
muttering of an incantation your fingers wash
through the air a faint silver gleam across your
fingertips Nothing magical shows up in the
immediate vicinity
 You fumble for a second but the card still
finds its way through without issue
 Yasha at this point the barmaid Adelaine
comes up and hands you the ordered ale
 On the house
 It is actually the day of Grissen and your
first show is today
 And as they leave you Yasha just downs her
entire ale slams it on the table and they both
walk out passing a couple more flyers at off
tables and then exit out to the rest of the days
sun beyond your sight
 Both of them have small cloaks over the
shoulders Beau has a
 No you do not
 No you do not
 No
 You watch as just beneath the table this
orange patchy tabby leaps up
 Okay You watch as four of the nearby
windows slam open with a sudden burst of wind and
all the various bits of torchlight that light the
deeper and more shadowed corners of the room
suddenly darken and flicker The music suddenly
comes to a stop Everyone holds their position and
glances over at the table where youre all sitting
 They all slam shut a second time The light
flickers and then brightens back to its normal place
 One really crotchetylooking guy in his
early s with a super underbite probably missing
most of his teeth just goes

 Okay As soon as you sit down Frumpkin
leaps into your lap and starts purring and rubbing
up against your hand
 As far as you know right now Yeah hes
having an actual allergic attack A minor one
 Soltryce
 It is the CrickQueens Call
 So far
 Make a sleightofhand check
 Make a perception check
 Well first whatd you roll for
 Okay yeah so you only get to reroll one of
the dice
 Go ahead So make a sleightofhand check
 Well roll a perception check
 Thats a foursilver pot
 So you get to reroll
 And you get to reroll one as well
 Make an athletics check You make an
acrobatics check
 So the female goblin draws a shortsword You
reach out to grab and she slips out of your grasp
and is now holding the blade at the edge of the
table
 Yorda looks over and goes Any preference
of family
 Von Brandt it is
 Another round is brought to your table You
guys can share a solemn postgame drink amongst
yourselves
 They have Your meals been presented for a
while now Youve had the opportunity to eat most
of your meal
 That is actually real Thats the power of
imagination Sam That wasnt there a second ago
 So you all finish your independent meals and
decide to continue your conversations or go about
your business for the day
 If you have no other business we can wait
until dusk
 You go ahead and take a look at it There is
one sheet that pertains to somebody in the Hills
Ward looking for folks to go ahead and do an
extermination run near the southern portion of the
Ustaloch It looks like theres what looks to be
a vole infestation
 Its a small rat
 Currently it looks like there was another
sheet that looks like most has been torn off The
rest of the board is pretty empty at the moment
 You did yes
 It was to help move and load crates at one
of the local breweries
 Welcome to level two
 Okay so theres a slight sense of warmth
that emanates from under her hand and for a
moment you look over and glance instinctively
ready to almost draw your sword again But it
seems to quicken your reflexes You have this
surge of adrenaline that doesnt quite fade
 For the next hour
 You may

  If you want to go ahead and try and
lie
 So are you lying
 No I presume and we discussed this a
little bit we presume it may have been scavenged
from a porcelain doll
 The internets running with that now
 No that is actually the Baumbauch
 Yeah the Starosta is kind of tied with the
Baumbauch family
 You can totally do that
 Yeah we can do that Well say if you guys
decide to go ahead and travel the five of you
you make your way through the town for the day
you coast around the Husseldorf family brewery
you meet Voss and June who are the two very nice
ladies who run the facility The Husseldorf
family You avoid the Baumbauch but can acquire
Baumbauch ale from other taverns in the town of
course And the von Brandt family brewery All of them as
soon as you say Trost they correct you and say
the family name Theyre very intent on getting
rid of the name Trost as an overall discussion
of Trostbrand brews and trying to make it their
family name Theres an offense to the point
where youre like Oh Jesus I didnt realize
 But you manage to get nice and sauced
throughout the day
 Okay
 Okay
 All right well that being the case
 No make a constitution saving throw
  okay You get a little woozy for a
while and as the sun begins to crawl towards the
distant horizon you do not manage to allow your
meal to usurp your control
 Yeah Dont remind me
 So as the day comes to a close youre
fairly tipsy youre not fully intoxicated For
your trip you wanted to head to the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding
 Okay Go ahead and make an investigation
check
  You take the better part of  minutes
or so and you find theres a lot of books on
farming techniques Theres a lot of books about
how to grow care for different types of
vegetation plants various beasts of burden You
find books on the different seasons and whats
best for different types of grain and wheats You
manage to pull through and find a couple of books
that deal with discussion of the Menagerie Coast
that talk about whats called the Clovis Concord
Its more of a discussion of the political
structure that maintains all the citystates there
 Yeah Sheenah yeah
 If youre looking for some sort of a
library your best bet is to go to Zadash up north
 Thats where the Library of the Cobalt Soul
resides They have all the information you could
hope for A bit pricey to peruse their interior
unless you have proper coverage but unfortunately
if what we have isnt what youre looking for I
cant help you
 Oh Jamiesons Hoedown yes quite That
will be two silver pieces
 Please do Do you want me to hold it for
you
 Whats your name
 All right I will keep it here under the
shelf Thank you so much
 Its a boutique Its designed almost like a
cross Theres two crosssections of hallways that
have books across the walls and theres a window
at the end of each and then a door at the far back
 Go ahead and make a sleightofhand check
 Over the period of him searching and
distracting this man you have completely
rearranged the interior of this bookstore to the
point where even in the far corner you
Ghostbusters stack them in the center of the room
floortoceiling with him not even noticing it
 You feel confident and happy and a sensation
of approval washes over you All right so
 Okay You turn around from having this
conversation and notice the interior is not as you
last saw it and a bit of nerves begin to brew up
under you
  Frumpkin follows behind
 I didnt even think about that until now
God damn it All right so as you guys have
gathered at this point the oranges and the pinks
of dusk begin to peek through the quitecloudy
sky the chilled air of the coming night sky
signalling the Crowns Guard to begin lighting the
hanging lanterns that line the streets of
Trostenwald A renewed energy takes the streets as
the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the
night air
 Sure yeah Ill allow that All right
Folks begin to prod their heads out into the open
air curious about the source of this unusual din
and you find your vision capturing a small
procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading
through the central road A lanky man of some
obvious elven descent leads the pack his long
ashybrown hair curling eversoslightly past his
midback his long coat and tails knocking around
by his skipping step Two halfling women in purple
and green bodysuits dance from side to side
handing flowers to children and flyers to adults
as a bald man in a neckfrilled frock coat of
bright red his face adorned in vibrant orange
makeup to look like the setting sun behind him
plays the violin that you heard earlier in an
upbeat jovial manner A tall halforc masculine
man with a wellgroomed handlebar mustache that
curves out to the side billowing white silk shirt
and black trousers follows behind with a big drum
slung over his shoulder going  along with the
fiddle The tiefling man of lavender skin that you
saw earlier walks along with a grin juggling two
curved scimitars as he walks in place almost
loses one and catches it continues to go
Families are beginning to gather out to see this
display The two dancers part and then a woman of
short fiery red hair and dark skin walking
between them lifting a small candle before
fwoosh A giant burst a gout of flame emerges
from the front of her mouth brightens the
vicinity and everyone collectively gasps and
begins cheering and clapping as they continue the
walk There to the back of it you see the rather
burlylooking pale woman arms crossed just
following behind and keeping an eye like a
security guard to ensure that no business gets out
of hand The gasps and the cheers begin to follow
and as the procession continues down its way the
families and civilians begin to gather and follow
behind As the last bit of the sun sets behind the
mountain range the torches glowing the
procession curves through the center of the Loch
Ward to the edge of the Ustaloch itself Through
the fishing village more folks begin to gather
Do you all follow
 People following the parade you see faces
eager for this fresh form of entertainment
Children laugh and chatter excitedly while the
Crowns Guard in their familiar bronze and
vermilion uniform try to maintain order between
themselves being quite curious or visibly
mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have
usurped the evening air The procession continues
towards the eastern side out along the southern
edge of this Loch Ward to the Ustalochs
southern place towards the new completely
constructed large dark blue tent Lengthy
streamers of white and silver flap with the cold
winds from the top of the structure As you guys
walk you watch as the horned tiefling you had
approached earlier slowly saunters up to your
side you recognizing these individuals you had
spoken with earlier
 At this point a voice rings out behind you
you see as the carnival master Gustav glances over
your shoulder and goes You two skip ahead
quick We need to go ahead and set up Looks like
were already having quite a few people excited to
come here so at the door interior to set up
Meet us at the front Actually you know what
Youll be on card duty We need a little extra
change on the side
 All right Folks excited for your
patronage As he spins around and addresses the
whole crowd now and says Enjoy the night air
Walk slowly We need just a moment to set up And
the halfelf man bows and tips his large it
looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy
towards the top and flops forward and he puts it
back on top and begins sauntering continuing the
music but picking up their pace to get ahead of
the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the
exterior tent And thats where were going to go
ahead and take our break

Foster friend of the show is the host of the
show and hell be there Tuesday talking about
this episode tonight with some of the cast PM
Pacific time on Tuesday So Anyway

 Bringing us back
 Its so hackneyed As you guys begin to
approach the outside of this large dark navy
tent people are being inspected and ushered
through by the wellgroomed halforc on one side
and the pale woman Yasha you met for a second
time approaching the outskirts of this carnival
with entry fees being collected by both as people
begin to pass into this large structure A few
feet off to the side you see a small crowd
gathered around Mollymauk who is sitting atop a
small blanket and has cards splayed before him a
similar set that you saw Jester toying with
earlier and a farmer sits across from him
listening intently All right so what can you
tell me about this here cough
 Oh going on like three four months

 Oh right now Yeah
 From who What do the cards tell me
 Right Of course Oh thank you so much
And he places a
 Stands up Dear a physician And he walks
off

 Yeah he doesnt enter the tent He goes off
to the side
 A heavy greenishgreyskinned mitt slaps
onto Beaus shoulder as you glance over to see
the large wellgroomed halforc man standing
there Im terribly sorry but weve got it taken
care of If you wish to pay entry you can but
the rules are the rules So sorry
 Yasha does that seem all right
 Bo
 Thank you
 Really
 No no Im curious about this How do you
spell your name
 Oh mines just BO
 Its not inaccurate And he flicks the
side of his mustache

 Make a perception check
 Make an insight check Eight Thankfully
youre not in proximity enough to catch a whiff of
his mustache
 Okay Interestingly enough he seems very
well puttogether And he seems like hes just
fucking with you Hes having fun and hes
messing with you and hes just casual and
competent and actually pretty wellgroomed He
doesnt smell And he seems more just enjoying the
discourse
 Well If it helps with any other confusion
call me the Breaker Well if you see the rest of
the show perhaps youll see why I got my name
 And he cracks his arms I am Towards the
end
 Well then May I You can see now the
crowds starting to queue up behind you pretty
heavily Besides if youre going to enter weve
got to get through the rest of this riffraff Do
you wish to join in
 Sure roll an investigation check Ill give
you advantage because youre really good at this
 You find two books and a modicum of change
and nothing else on him Hes actually pretty
sparse as far as collectibles and keepsakes
 Okay make a sleightofhand check to try
and hide that
 You have advantage on that technically
right Dexterity checks
 Let me doublecheck that real fast
 What the heck
 No it is stealth Youre correct Yeah
 You see him slowly pocketing this crossbow
 What do you pull out
 A falchion a large curved sword emerges
from a sheath on his back
 Make a perception check
  thats enough As she spins the falchion
around you notice that affixed to her back in
uncharacteristically clean leather towards the
rest of her outfit what appears to be a
slungover sheath and a very large bladed weapon
larger than your falchion affixed to her back
 Both her and the halforc turn to you
 Just carries her right in Perfect
 At which point the other Bo Bo the
Breaker goes ahead and collects five copper from
each of you as you pass through so mark off five
copper except for the two of you you guys are
part of it
 So stepping into the interior of the tent
the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and
various flattened groundscape on the outskirts of
the Ustaloch you can see a thick heavy
tarplike material hitting the very edge where the
heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the
tent youre within You can see where the seating is
guided across the floor and there already in a
very packed room you see a few dozen townsfolk
that have begun to gather in a semicircle There
is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys
are walking in As soon as you walk in you can
see a central pillar a heavy column of wood a
tree that has been completely rounded off on all
sides held aloft to carry the top of the canopy
of the tent itself And across the way you can
see a larger flap tent that is currently closed
that appears to be probably the performers
entrance You can see above you four hanging
lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker
of light but the pattern to them is consistent
meaning its not probably natural flame Children
and people are beginning to mash around the sides
and the space along the edges of the interior of
this tent is starting to get a little cramped
Where do you guide them Yasha
 So theres if you consider a semicircle
pattern here theres if youre entering you
can go front to the right front to the left
front to the center anywhere in between Where
would you like to be currently sitting
 Front and center okay
 Okay
 So she places you on the ground as there
are no chairs
 Where are they going to transport benches
from place to place
 Well sorry you have Fletching and Moondrop
to deal with
 So as the music has died down and everyone
begins to crowd in and whisper to themselves
eventually it begins to quiet a bit everyone
having their seats The familiar sound of the
fiddle begins to play and everyone quickly gets
quiet down to a hush The music seems sourceless
in the interior of the tent Everyone begins to
look around to see where it may come from You
hear points of hushed looks pointing off in
different areas and at the top of the tent you
see seeming to stretch and fall like a slow drop
of water the man in red you saw earlier descends
from the top of the tent but now dressed
headtotoe in a matching deep blue outfit and
full makeup to where he appears out of the canopy
of the tent He hangs from a rope by one foot
its wrapped around and clutched as his foot
catches the edge Playing his violin
eversoslowly as he carefully descends and then
at the last moment releases the rope and lands on
his feet continuing the music hes playing He
slowly spins as the longerhaired elf leader of
the earlier parade that you saw the one that had
marked back briefly to your two new friends over
here enters the tent from the distant flaps the
performers entrance his head now sporting that
same tall hat flopping backwards at the apex He
extends his arms removing the hat and takes a
deep bow as the crowd begins to clap

 Ladies and gentlemen of Trostenwald I am
Carnival Master Gustav Fletching and allow me to
welcome you to the Fletching and Moondrops
Traveling Carnival of Curiosities

 I ask you each and every one of you You
hear some children giggle as he makes eye contact
grant us your imaginations this eve but a
trifle bit of time and allow us to reveal a realm
of laughter mystery danger and beauty I see
youve already met Desmond And he gestures
towards the man in all blue whos playing the
fiddle Hell be part of our story tonight so
keep a wily eye for the shifting fool But first
I tell you a tale of two sisters of the Fey And
as Desmond slowly leaves the tent you see two
armored guards by where he is now have entered
two of the Crowns Guard are stepping by the
entrance where he walked in watch him pass Lost
without form into the mazes of the underworld
There where the body would break they found a
teacher in a mystical serpent and the gift they
received was the ability to bend with this maze
that captured them and slither their way back to
the surface to reclaim their place in the world
May I present to you Mona and Yuli the Knot
Sisters As he slowly backs through the
performers entrance the two halfling dancers you
saw earlier in the full bodysuits emerge from
behind the Carnival Master as he discreetly exits
They sport serpentine makeup scales affixed to
the sides of their face and arms Approaching the
central spire the pole that holds the tent up
one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the
other bending her back a nearimpossible amount
creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the
front row cringe at the idea of the pain that
would cause an average individual But these
halflings are very nimble and able to create
almost a single form out of two bodies Their
rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move
and shift to the music the violin now sourceless
once again not seeing where this Desmond is
placed but they seem to move as it picks up
speed
 Suddenly the top one folds over and slams
into the ground tumbling across the center in a
wild display of physical control The two of them
begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes
their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the
rigid halfling forms you had seen and you swear
for a moment becoming serpentinelike as they
intertwine around the base of this pole Its
beautiful and violent at the same time Its
offputting And watch as they curl around the
base of this pole the lights above begin to
become a dull greenishblue and get darker and
darker presenting this imagery of the underworld
One by one they silently tell a tale of struggle
crawling across one then the other one at a
time using their serpentinelike forms as an
extending ladder folding over each other as they
use every muscle in their body to cling around
this pole and ladderstep up like a snake Its a
very strange but alluring sight and you cant
help but notice that you forget that these are two
halfling girls and you find yourself pulled into
this wordless story they tell of climbing back to
their place to the surface towards the dark sky
of lightless blue cloth As the baubles that
contain the interior light of the tent begin to
glow brighter and brighter their climbing becomes
more fevered The two of them arm into arm leg
into leg rolling up and swirling until
eventually at the apex they grab each others arms
around the pole before spinning downward
backtoback legs outward with a rapid pace the
music coming to a full crescendo Like a Maypole
they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the
ground before the audience with a flourish arms
in the air and the audience erupts in applause

 As they both begin to back away smiles on
their faces nodding to each other Gustav emerges
once more from the performers flap The fool
appears at the back entrance again taking an
ominous tune with his violin this time his outfit
no longer blue but deepset black The hanging
lights darken once again as Gustav takes the
center stage In a flash beyond the ash the
gods all went and gone The darkness came to
grasp reclaim and suffocate the dawn Suddenly
out of the darkness behind him a burst of flame
lights the room But from that night a burning
light doth keep back shadows bane The strength
to fight will set alight the morning sun again
Ladies and gentlemen I present to you Ornna the
fire fairy And Gustav leaves the tent once more
As you watch a pair of metallic fans alight with
flame now frame the beautiful woman of short red
hair you had seen before in the procession Gustav
slinks into the darkness and vanishes as Ornna
spins in hypnotic twirl her simple dress of golds
and reds almost glowing in the firelight around
her the flickering of the flames giving her the
visage of a warriorgoddess battling the dark that
surrounds The frenzied fiddle of the fool picks
up as she twirls the fans in her grasp her face
stoic and graceful simultaneously The hushed awe
of the audience fills the air watching this
magnificent warrior strike at the shadows the
lights above flickering brighter with each spin
and dive banishing the shadows from the room She
matches the pace of the music drawing to a
crescendo and leaps and barrelturns and
climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the
lights rocket to a victorious luminescence Once
again the crowd goes crazy

 Gustav enters as she exits with a bow the
fans flickering out He enters clapping at Ornna A
low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the
fiddle grows tense once more Even as the sun
would rise anew bellowing roars will quake the
lands of Xhorhas and beyond Terrible beasts now
freed from their dark masters scattered into our
world  A terrible guttural roar shakes
the room followed by the sounds of grinding and
dragged chains From behind the performers flap
the halforc Bo who youd met earlier the
Breaker and the fool who is now still playing
the fiddle yet the bow of it continues to go on
its own as he drags the other chain with his arm
wrapped around his forearm The two of them pull
something through the flap It swells and from
beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of
green scales slimylooking skin and a corpulent
form large toadlike legs frame a rotund torso
and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling
him in It fights and wrestles against the taut
chains as its pulled further and further towards
the center of the tent but is held in place by
the two men It roars a second time  The
front row immediately pulling back and screaming
You hear kids begin to cry A handful of townsfolk
shoot to their feet grasping the children in
fear preparing to run
 You have not seen this creature Gustav
continues seemingly unflinched by its approach
The deviltoad crawls hungrily
 into the land of the free folk lording
over nightmares as they say and what truth lies
behind the eyes of this beast What would be
learned when the guiding heart of innocence
pierces the hateful soul and brings it to see
beauty for the first time I present to you the
vivid voice of Toya And as Gustav backs away
the deviltoad struggling against the chains a
soft faint voice begins to slowly emanate from
the air


 Eyes previously locked on the frightening
creature now seek a source and find atop a
platform within the chamber high up on a small
platform set against the apex of the pole a young
dwarven girl maybe  years of age her braided
golden hair clasped and her hands at her side a
white dress obscuring her feet She sings with a
mystifying mature voice that pierces your hearts
with joy unexpectedly and uncontrollably The
crowd audibly gasps as one the entrancing song of
this girl bringing every person into this music
The deviltoad stops struggling against the
chains seemingly caught by the sound of her
voice Its face drops into a soft smile as it
slowly walks towards the base of the pole and
sits The halforc and the fool drop the chains and
back away leaving the beast free in its rapture
Her voice almost begins to summon a chorus from
the ether magical in nature as there are no
others but her joining into this piece Her smile
is infectious and you cant tear your eyes away
You only now realize the tears down your cheeks
but you cannot break your gaze From the front row
of the audience on the left a man stands up his
arms outstretched towards her His dirtied cloak
falls away his face and skin wracked with age
You see his legs shaking as he stands his cheeks
wet with tears He shouts  His arms
drop and clutch his chest Gurgles a burst of vocal pain
once more and folks nearest to him begin to lean
away as he begins to shake You glance over as the
old man yells out once more as the skin on his
arms suddenly begins to tear the bones splitting
from the flesh writhing cracking Dust and blood
shake from his wounds as his form swells Screams
begin to ring out from the audience around him
people rising up and running for the exit Chaos
breaks into the room around you Toyas song
abruptly ends the little girl looking down with
fright in her eyes the deviltoad glancing about
worriedly the halforc and the fool rushing up
beside him to look at the transforming man The
halforc yells escorting patrons to the exit
Everyone Leave the tent now Kylre As he
points to the deviltoad get her to safety
The deviltoad glances up and leaps with a sudden
gust of strength to the top and grabs the center
pole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to
his weight He grabs the little girl safely under
his arm and leaps back down What are you all doing
 You watch as her form suddenly dissipates
into multiple seemingly copies of her form as
Jester
 The old mans body stops quaking his flesh
now grey and mangled like an ancient tree trunk
He turns his eyes bloodred and bulging his lips
curled into a horrifying grimace The two Crowns
Guard begin to try and make their way through the
panicked crowd but the people like a wave of
chaos are keeping them at bay I need everyone to
roll initiative

 So you guys this guy is actually over here
You guys are all up here in the front
 All right so  to 
 All right
 Nice  to ten
 So  and then ten and ten Sorry  So
Yasha got  then we have Fjord And then  And
then we have Nott at ten And whatd you get
 There we go Okay so Top of the round as
this creature turns and glares about in the area
this swollen form over here to the side thats
what remains of the old man who had stood up in
the center of the chamber Jester youre up
first
 Okay as it turns towards you Its a saving
throw correct
 Go ahead and roll on that
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Yasha youre almost on deck
 How much damage was that d 
 Okay which for your duplicate I should
go ahead and grab something
 Almost I was like thats right you can do
this so I need to pull out well say for the
purposes of this youre well put you this
will be your duplicate wherever you want to move
it from where you are so she moves there
 Just let me know where There
 You can get there
 Okay so that ends your turn At the top of
your turn this creature closest to one of the
people nearby screaming this young woman whos
trying to back away it just turns toward her and
grabs and tries to tear into her with two strikes
The first one that is actually going to miss She
ducks out of the way and begins crawling across
the ground as it goes for a second attack That
however does hit its a  Thatll do it So
with eight points of bludgeoning damage it
reaches down and slams its fist into her chest
and as it does she gives out this horrible yelp
as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her
flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and
stands up its eyes scanning the room for the next
possible victim Its going to begin to stalk
forward coming up to that guy All right Yasha
your turn
 Youre right there Youd have to Youre
pretty close to everybody You could distribute
you could use your action to toss the weapons out
to everybody this turn Ill say
 Okay so youll spend your action throwing
them out to the individuals So your shortsword
and crossbow clatter to the ground and you
quickly scramble to grab them Calebs dagger
falls at his foot Your staff gets tossed quickly
from behind you Your falchion meets your arm
 All right That ends Yashas turn Fjord
youre up
 You actually rush through Jesters form You
watch the image dissipate as you charge through it
and meet up facetoface with this large
gnarled horriblelooking creature What are you doing
 You may
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Yeah
 All righty That ends your turn All right
youre done That brings us to Caleb
 Okay going through the crowd is
 Push through to about there You end up
pushing a kid out of the way
 All right go ahead and make a spell
attack
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Theres Prismatic Spray Chromatic is the
starter version
  All right very well done
Caleb
 So as you push the child out of the way
turn putting your pocketed diamond out in front
of you you focus and you watch as this beam of
light blue energy streaks past just barely
coasting between a few heads It slams into this
creature as crystals form where the
wound and impact was It cracks back into place
where it was End of your turn All right Nott
youre up
 Make a performance check
 Okay As youre singing out this discordant
sound folks nearby are covering their ears and
glancing back and looking in surprise at this
strange creature giving off this
 No However it now after taking a few hits
nearby its red eyes or at least one red eye
slips over to look in your direction Thats as
much of an effect
 Do you want to move or are you going to
stay there
 Okay You can get behind there Okay All
right that ends your turn
 Beau youre up
 You can certainly on the first attack Go
for it Make an athletics check
  You attempt with your first strike and
the creature just breaks away Its strength is far
more than you imagined it would be from what was
originally an elderlylooking frame
 That is correct
 Yes if youre using your ki point to do
that yes
 Both hit Roll damage for each
 Between both Great So after the grapple
fails and it pushes you away you go ahead and
pull back and then leap kick it in the chest and
then uppercut it in the chin
 Looks back towards you So that would be
putting you up basetobase with it there All
righty Ending your turn Okay at that point the
crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and
push in this direction These folks all begin to
run back and around this way This crowd begins to
push the guards are trying to push forward and they
can only get a little ways forward to there and
there Everyone just shifts out this direction
 Caleb and Nott I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws
 All right You both manage to just bob and
weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled
and backing away from the chaos as people are
pushing through The entrance is too small for
everyone to leave and theres now a giant
bottleneck thats beginning to push up as people
are now screaming and trying to get out Theyre
crying and the chaos is just swelling into this
absolute cacophony As soon as that finishes the
deviltoad carrying the dwarven girl who was
given a decree exits out back with her to get her
to safety These two begin to slowly back away
seeing that things seem to be handled And the
guards making their way in are looking scared at
each other not really knowing what to make of the
current chaos At that point you watch as the
woman whose chest was torn into by this creature
suddenly

 snaps up into place
 Top of the round Jester youre up
 What was your initiative again
 Ten oh shit Thats right youre with
Nott thats what happened So Molly you go ahead
and go for your turn as well My apologies
 Youre right there Youre in the middle of
the crowd as its swarming around you and Yasha
 You cant really flank it but you can get
next to it
 You can yeah
 Okay so you watch as Molly pulls the
scimitar out and as he unsheathes it draws it
across the side of his exposed chest causing a
little bit of blood to spill out and as it does
he pulls the blade out and you watch as the edge
suddenly ice crystals begin to build on the outside
of the blade
 That hits
 Okay so nine points of damage on the first
strike
 That was your bonus thats all youve got
Okay So one strike you cut across and you watch
as you cut this wide wound open exposing the
fleshy organs interior but theyre frozen where
the wound cut through and its still holding it
together Its looking like its starting to hurt
a bit and fall apart slightly
 Yes So that ends your turn Molly Brings
us to the top So Jester sorry back to you
 Toll the Dead
 Natural one Go ahead and roll a d
 Three points of necrotic damage So as this
deep temple bell rings out in the air above you
watch as this creature who has turned and is
beginning to just whale upon the surrounding
allies that are curling at its sides it seems to
retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly
before angrily lashing out
 Cool Is that your turn All right The
standing creature thats now been sliced
bludgeoned and wounded by all three of you is
going to go ahead and make two strikes at roll
randomly to see who it goes for Thats going to
be at Beauregard It swings at you twice both
with its giant massive clawed fists just striking
out towards you First one is  to hit
 Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the
first one just slams you in the chest You feel
the wind knocked out of you for a brief second
The second swings going to come at you Thats
going to be a  to hit
 And thats going to be six points of
bludgeoning damage to you
 It slams into you once with the fist and
the other one grabs into your stomach abdomen
region and the claws dig in and its jaw unhinges
and drops like a snakes
 The other one is going to rush over towards
you Mollymauk as youre the closest one to it
and is going to take one swing at you
 Okay so youre using a reaction You dont
have to roll anything for it He just has
disadvantage on the strike
 Thatll do it He rolled a  and then a
four So as it swings towards you you watch as
suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second
creature go black and it goes way too wide and
misses you You easily duck out of the way of its
first strike As it runs past towards you this
way you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves
your attack range to attempt to swing around Molly
for a second strike Go for it
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 With this brief opening as it rushes past
Mollymauk after its eyes go black you watch as
it stumbles its vision ruined With that moment
you swing out with your falchion thank you
Yeah its falchion thats right and strike
across the back of its shoulder You see what once
was this beautiful young woman is now this
swollen horrible undead form lumbering past and
you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder
It curves around and makes a second strike at you
Mollymauk This one without advantage Thats a
natural  Yeah thats a  to hit All right
You take eight points of bludgeoning damage as
the first one you manage to move out of the way
and as you spin your scimitar around you glance
over just in time to have it clock you right
across the jaw Your vision blurs and doubles for
a second Thats going to end their turn Yasha
youre up
 Yeah you can reckless attack any of your
attacks
 You roll at advantage
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Freshly purchased In fact this is the
first time its seen battle
 On the one thats already been damaged
 Yeah all right
 Yeah no it does not make the save it
rolled yeah So as you come down with your blade
and carve through its body you watch as it curls
back trying to reform and hold itself but your
blow was too strong and its zombieish form
cannot maintain a cohesive hold on its form and
you watch as it just crumbles to the ground no
longer moving

 Okay that ends your turn As youre there
growling animalistically towards the creature
 You have about five more feet of movement
if you wanted to move
 All right That ends your turn Yasha
Fjord youre up
 Okay So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards
it his large armored halforc form holding the
blade in his hand Puts his hand out and the
shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this
zombified womans form and cling to it like its
holding it in place So with it now hexed what
would you like to do
 All right go for it
 That definitely hits Go ahead and roll
damage
  points of damage
 So as you rush up after the shadows gather
around it it looks up to you and it pulls back
ready to strike and you just shake your head and
one large swipe of your falchion carves this giant
mark across its chest Where the cloth and flesh
opens you can see this blackened interior where
the muscles are trying to move almost like worms
to regather and tighen All right that ends your
turn That brings us to Caleb
 You can push right about there You just
barely pull through the crowd to the front to get
a clear
  unfortunately does not hit So as you
pull it out a second time youre pushing through
the crowd and you pull up your diamond and right
as youre about to release the spell one of the
people in the crowd slams into you with her
shoulder and you get jarred off to the side The
acid bolt of the Chromatic Orb flies off and
actually burns a hole through the distant tent and
then vanishes into the night sky
 All right that ends your turn Caleb Nott
youre up
 Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it
yes
 All right go for it
  hits
 Okay As you pull around the corner and
release your one crossbow bolt it hits the bottom
of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes The eye
goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is
now jammed outside of the socket The creature
turns glancing your direction It looks pretty
hurt but its still standing
 Ill say you can use your bonus action to
just look Theres nothing you can do this turn
but next turn you could So make a perception
check
 Nine Its hard to look You see this what
looks to be lates woman dressed in some sort of
general workers clothing with a loose apron and
shes just running and scrambling to get towards
the exit You dont see anything of worth on her
unfortunately Sorry All right Nott that ends
your turn Molly youre up
 Okay so you spin around You pull your
second scimitar out as part of the strike one of
them encased in ice crystals So the first
strike make sure you mark which ones which
  just barely hits
 That hits yeah
 Four points of damage
 Nine points of damage all right
 Okay So the first strike hits and as the
scimitar carves through the body snaps and opens
and it snaps back into place the torso locking
back in The second strike does how much damage
 Yeah The second one hits again and you
watch as the torso spins off It looks like only the
spinal column is holding it in place but its
managing to maintain its structure as it 
That ends your turn
 All right ending Mollymauks turn that
brings us to Beau
 Wham Go for it
 Thatll hit Damage
 Six points of damage Natural  You watch
as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and
then snaps back into place As you land pulling
it back you can see some of the teeth are
actually stuck in your fist as you pull back
theyve broken off into your knuckles
 Her teeth technically this is the woman
that was killed originally
 Go for it Two more strikes
 Natural one no So the second punch you
swing wide and hit the side of the head and the neck
snaps and its now stuck in a sideways position
As it turns the jaw it pulls back one of its
weirdly swollen clawed hands ready to go for that
open wound in your gut and as it does
how do you want to do this

 And as you do that you slam into its face
You watch as the skull caves in the teeth
piercing both of the red bulging eyes And with
this horrible sucking sighing sound it falls
onto its back no longer moving the shadows
released
 That was your turn unfortunately Thats
your turn At this point the current threats are
down and the crowd is screaming and rushing The
two members of the Crowns Guard are rushed to the
front weapons ready and they see both of these
creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of
this In the midst of the chaos one of them
points and goes You you Stay where you are
And you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly
pushes through you see as Gustav
manages to make his way in Dear god whats
happened here Looks over toward Bo the Breaker
the halforc whos now joined the rest of you
Sir I dont know how he got in here And
everyone looks around back at you Bo looks at
you Gustav looks to you Molly What happened
 Okay At this point the two Crowns Guard
that are there are trying desperately to maintain
control You can see theyre visibly shaken and
they glance at each other like theyre a little
out of their depths at the moment Stay where you
are Dont go anywhere
 And he turns to the one whos in the front
looks to the other one who just made his way
through and goes Sivelmen find someone Bring
the rest of the guard Please Right now sir
And he pushes his way towards the back as the rest
of the crowd runs out Now everyone in the crowd
has mostly pushed out of the tent the last few
dregs pushing through Children crying people of
Trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they
close and youre all standing there weapons in
your hands wondering what to do
 Theyre both unmoving ruined torn apart
 You can As you go to move to it both of
your forms merge The Crowns Guard goes like
Dont move
 Both Uh He looks genuinely confused
 Okay It mimics searching a body Its not
actually you Begins rifling imaginary things out
of the pockets
 Make a deception check to try and deceive
him to glance over
  He goes What over there Looks
over as you jump over quickly and begin searching
through it and you guys watch her do this and
theres a clear line of sight As soon as he turns
back hes going to notice her rifling through the
other corpse
 Gustav is now walking up and hes hands up
in the air Im terribly sorry I this has
never happened I dont know what happened What
happened
 Shes been singing with us for over two
years now
 She had no family and she was singing in
the street for change There was an opportunity
We seized it We gave her a family she didnt
have
 The Crowns Guard goes like  Its
fine just dont move
 Make an investigation check
 You manage to rifle through the old mans
body through the stringy bits of gore and you do
find three pieces of silver that are just coated
in blood A few moments pass The rest of the
people are gone and its just this awkward quiet
and at this point you watch as Ornna the fire
fairy who had previously performed walks in and
is like Im sorry What has happened here
 At this motion Gustav goes Its generally
just because we want to promote a space of
welcoming cleanliness When were working amongst
the outskirts of the Empire we dont want to
bring an element that reminds you of death and
 Well were in entertainment We have to be
cautious The single Crowns Guard guy whos
sitting there with his weapon out you can see him
shaking almost hes never had to deal with
anyting like this before
 Towards him
 Make a deception check
 He goes Dont try that on me Ive been
doing this for over ten years
 Make a sleightofhand check to see if you
can cast this spell subtly enough or not
 As you attempt to cast this spell a little
bit of spittle gets caught in your windpipe and
you begin to cough uncontrollably Yeah it just
falls away
 And that is extremely worrying Nobody
touch that body And he looks back and sees you
coughing over the corpse and the guys like
Dont you touch that body Are you sick
 Someone hold her down If shes sick and
turns into one of these I will not
 Make a deception check
  His face goes white and he goes Kill
the thing And rushes forward blade held above
 He holds back He turns to you and sees you
standing a full four inches taller than him with a
much larger blade with one hand and he goes
Look if shes going to become one of these
things we have to stop her now
 Immediately rubs his eyes You can see him
now that hes closer to you you can see hes
sweating hes scared hes generally trying the
best he can to use whatever training hes received
to deal with a scenario he was not trained for
 One of the Crowns Guard The Crowns Guard
are all generally hired and trained militia that
are sent amongst all the cities to keep the
peace
 Flynn
 Ten years two months ago
 No Dont move
 At this point the flaps at the front of the
tent the entranceway fold in and you watch as
one two three four six ten Crowns Guard
begin filtering into the chamber You watch as one
man the one who has his helmet off and under his
shoulder hes maybe in his early s or so short
brown hair with patches of grey Somewhat
jaundiced skin Molly youve encountered this man
once before when you entered the city He
approaches Gustav right now with a commanding
voice I had a gut feeling that you were nothing
but trouble when you came into our town Gustav
turns around I guarantee to you my friend I
have no idea What happened here The Crowns
Guard whos been shaken turns around and goes
Sir Flynn There was a creature This carnival
seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that
killed and then created a secondary beast I
watched it with my own eyes from the back row
And the man turns back towards Gustav and the rest
of you And who else saw that
 Flynn turns to you and goes Put your
weapons down or well arrest you immediately
 Flynn turns back and says Watchmaster
what should we do And the man with the helmet
under his arm walks forward walks to Gustav
gives him one look over still a few inches
shorter than him Looks at him with a sense of
purpose and social status that has a sense of
disinterest and disrespect You sir and your
orc and your circus are considered currently
under arrest Who else belongs to your merry
band He looks about the rest and Gustav goes
The orc Glances back at the two of you and
goes The rest of them are just purveyors of our
performances He was just joking earlier right
Make a deception check
 And you are also under arrest The rest of
you what are your names
 Do you Tell me
 Who is this
 Flynn escort this woman to retrieve this
individual she speaks of Flynn nods and walks
over towards you
 Stay where you are
 My men tell me that the rest of you helped
destroy these fiends Is that correct
 Then on behalf of the Starosta I
appreciate your aid But until this investigation
is complete you are all under investigation from
us Where are you staying
 Nestled He got it right
 Do not leave this city unless you are told
otherwise Should you do so I have your names
and I can have the full might of the Cerberus
Assembly track you down You Flynn Free this
girl While you all stand in the tent Flynn
approaches you and walks a little bit behind you
weapon drawn but at the side Do you lead him out
of the tent Okay So you walk through the
performers flap and as you walk out you can see
backed up into the number of tents that are set
up and some of the carts other members of the
circus are hiding and as soon as you exit out
the front and they see you before the Crowns
Guard they all immediately scatter and vanish to
the nearby shadows out of sight The two of you
walk out into the center the fire crackling in a
small pit off to the side All right where is
this girl you speak of
 Show me
 He follows you Which tent do you lead him
to Over here Okay theres a larger tent as he
walks by your side theres the flap thats
slightly open
 All right Gets his weapon ready and walks
into the tent
 Okay Theres a few moments before in the
distance you hear a voice say The tent is
empty What are you talking about Hello
Helloooo

 And you dont look back and you just run
into the darkness of night into the Marrow Fields
and disappear
 Okay Frumpkin keeps watch The Watchmaster
as you heard him notified earlier turns to the
rest of you So The investigation will begin If
any information comes to light that could
alleviate you of the charges brought to this
carnival come to me and let me know If you have
no answers before we complete this investigation
then I believe you all will fall into the judgment
 So the guards escort you out of the tent
Molly youre stuck behind with Gustav and Bo the
Breaker with a guard of five Crowns Guards set
to keep watch As the rest of you are sent to the
city the Watchmaster turns once more and says
Remember you flee Ill find you
And thats where well end tonights session

 And welcome back Last we left off our
slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to
have their stories intertwine in the city of
Trostenwald on the southern reaches of western
Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount Here we
had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling
southward coming and meeting in the center of the
tavern the Nestled Nook Inn with Jester
Beauregard and Fjord They were invited to a
nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their
performance later that evening in which they met
Yasha and Molly After swapping some stories
earning and losing some gold they began to gather
at the outskirts of the Ustaloch the lake right
on the eastern edge of Trostenwald for the first
opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop
Carnival of Curiosities
 Upon entering the tent they saw a number of
performances However during a musical performance
by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this
mysterious magically enchanting experience a
member of the audience rose up and began to
transform into a terrible undead creature that
began to lash out killing another member of the
audience who then began to become one of these
same creatures You all grabbing your weapons
from Yasha who had been keeping them stashed
away leapt into the fray slaughtered both of
these terrible beasts just in time for the
crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell
happened After information had been gathered of
who was immediately available and responsible for
this carnival Gustav Bo the Breaker and Molly
were marked to be arrested One of the guards was
escorted outside of the tent by Yasha who was
going to show him where this young dwarven girl
was currently resting and upon being led astray
to the wrong tent she just ran into the distant
hills and vanished And that is where we left off
 Youre still in the tent
 With the crownsguard and with Watchmaster
Jossyd The crownsguard that had left naught but a
moment before comes rushing in his breath
huffing sweat dripping from his brow his eyes
wild He goes Watchmaster The big woman is
gone Shes gone The Watchmaster turns to him
and says You three go with him Search for
her They all immediately run out back out the
performers flap and he turns to the rest of you
in the group Shackle and drag those three down
to the stockade About five guards approach and
begin to press Gustav Bo and Molly to the ground
and begin to put chains and shackles on them
 Hes in midspeech The rest of you keep an
eye on the performers here Ask around see what
you can find As for the others dont go far
 You may be innocent in which case you have
nothing to worry about However we have an
investigation to complete so I would ask that you
stay in the city and wait until you are called in
You will be questioned and when this
investigation is completed regardless of how long
it may take you are not to leave Trostenwald
 All the rest of the crownsguard glance to
each other he goes Well unfortunately that is
not for me to decide The Lawmaster would have to
be appealed to If you wish to come with us we
can bring you along with us to the stockade and
you can speak with her Then perhaps she may
grant you leniency but I can give you no
guarantee
 Well we could do that instead Well
have you arrested put you in the stockade as we
question the rest of you
 Were leaving The rest of you stay in here
Watch over the performers Make sure nobody
leaves Come if you wish Otherwise well be in
touch The Watchmaster gathers alongside the
other five crownsguard lifting up the shackles of
the three that had been arrested and begin to drag
them outside of the tent and into the night air
 Okay
 You may if you want to So you send
Frumpkin just to follow them You guys are staying
behind then
 The Watchmaster is going with them or at
least hes exiting the tent with them It looks
like there are five crownsguard attending the three
of them that are shackled
 Okay
 Okay so the two of you are following
Anybody with them Currently its you two and
Frumpkin
 All right so as you guys exit keeping
a pace behind watching the
crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards
the actual city Frumpkin keeping a zigzagging
distance behind and following
 Yes
 I would say yes but you are purely like
because all youre doing is walking forward and
you need someone to guide you
 He can talk but he cant hear you
 All right So first off Beauregard
 As you back out of the performers exit of
the tent into the center of their encampment the
immediate exit there are already four crownsguard
currently searching around and setting up a watch
perimeter around the different tents Theyre
gathering and making sure none of the other
performers have fled and a lot of them are being
brought out into an area where theres a number of
tents all facing towards a large campfire in the
center Theres a couple of chairs set up there
its kind of the common area for the performers of
the carnival and it looks like theyre all being
put out there so they can get a bead on it and
make sure they know where everyone else is
 Are you trying to stealth out of sight or
just trying to not draw attention
 Okay all right Go and make a stealth check
just to see if
  Okay As you kind of dart through the
flap of the tent and move behind one of the large
carts that currently is still affixed to a horse
that is currently just chewing on an apple and
you hear the crunch in its teeth you glance over
past the edge of the immediate near tent and you
can see this group gathering there and it appears
that no ones immediately aware of your presence
 Toya You do not see her yet The guard just
got out there and theyre just beginning to pull
people out You do see the fire dancer brought out
there You then see the two Yeah Ornna The
Knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there
and theyre all looking very frustrated
 Yeah theyre not shoving them around
theyre just calling them out to the front so they
know where they are
 Make a perception check
  Okay as you glance about you dont see
anything lurking in the shadows What you do
notice though is one of them bring Toya out of
one of the the tent thats on the southern side and
as he brings her out theres a heavy thud sound
and you see coming out from behind the tent the
large form of you heard the name Kylre once but
the devil toad The obese lizard man whos
stomping up behind
 It looks like a lizard man so scaled
humanoid but extremely thick bulbous belly
large almost froglike legs
 Due to the size of his form mostly all
fours and lumbering forward on all of them but
sits back on a bipedal situation
 The toad is hiding behind the tent and as
soon as Toya comes out comes up to the guard and
puffs up its chest The guard spins around and
goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully
 The horse is currently still up on the cart
but is about  feet from you
 You know what Lets go ahead and make an
animal handling check on that
  will do It wasnt a hard DC but it was
more knowing where to hit it to where it would
cause it to bolt versus just get angry
 So going for not to actually hurt the
creature but just enough to spook it you hit it
in the right place towards the back of its
hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up
  and go into a
sprint The cart begins to bounce and smash onto
the ground You can see the wheels clattering into
the rocks and the stone between the bits of
 Make another stealth check please
 Okay You dart around the north side of
these tents and youre pretty sure you werent
seen As the cart begins to bolt off behind this
horse you see all the crownsguard turn The one
that was currently staring at the devil toad
glances off to the side As he glances off the
devil toad takes Toya and just pulls her to him
protectively and the guard puts his sword away
Check Points to them and then bolts off to go
after the horse The other three stay watching
over the group
 I mean theyre scattered a bit but
theres
 Oh yeah Make another stealth check Youre
running through open areas each time youre doing this
 As you come up around the back of the devil
toad the guard that runs past doesnt immediately
notice you because hes focused on where this cart
is running off and you can see another guard that
was far away from this encampment thats circling
back with him The two of them are now bolting in
the direction as the cart begins to slow Its not
just going forward forever but it spooked him and
its starting to slow down Theyre just going to
inspect it However as you slink up behind the
devil toads head curls back towards you and you
hear this deep guttural 
 At which point a voice says Excuse me
And you can see the three guards are there
staring at you
 I did say there were three guards The three
guards watching them
 One of them left
 Its a bad stealth check Im sorry But
theres now three crownsguard right there and
theyre like Can I help you
 The guard thats closest to you glances to
the other guys and goes She was with the group
right They recognize you and they look at each
other Youre going to the stockade my dear
 The three guards slowly approach and they
begin to take out chains and manacle you up
 I know
 So youre shackled and begin to be dragged
toward the stockade
 Its the two guards now As youre being
brought back you can see more guards are coming
from the city to the carnival Theyre keeping it
under surveillance
 Theyre taking you to the city yeah
 Theyre leaving them behind currently with
the guards that are there Theyre not arresting
anybody from the carnival but theyre not letting
them leave But theyre keeping them there
 You are
 Okay Go ahead and
 First go ahead and make an athletics check
 As you go back to elbow you get halfway
there before your chains go taut Theyre both
holding the chain at each side and you see the
tension of it you cant even get him from behind
You imagine in your head you go over it two or
three times As you go through the first step
 doesnt go anywhere
 No Im sorry
 No Honestly the devil toad and her seem
pretty close He is grabbing her in a protective manner
 Two bad rolls in a row I know Level two
 You will shortly Ahead of her along the
way Gustav is just quiet Bo the Breaker Bosun
as you know him by his full name is grumbling
under his breath and is trying to outloud piece
together thoughts on what may have what
transpired saying things like I dont know you
think its done on the inside Or is this somebody
trying to sabotage it
 It is quite possible
 One of the guards tugs on both of your
chains and says Quiet now Save it for the
lawmaster They bring you in you go in through
the Lochward into the Hillsward which is the
southern portion of Trostenwald You are brought
to the outside of the stockade which is a large
singlestory tall rectangular building of large
stones and masonry Its built for function Its
not a very beautiful building but its
defensible and it seems fairly wellmade However
there are the banners of the crownsguard marking
the doubledoor entrance As youre brought
within you can already see there are two central
chairs where two current watch sit just watching
the front door Beyond the right you see is an
office that you guys are dragged to and the rest
of you eventually catch up to the group You are all
brought inside this darkened office Inside
relatively simple This isnt a librarytype study
office This is very much for function Theres a
couple of small crates that contain materials that
are too far in shadow to see the details of it
Look to be pieces of paper probably gathered
evidence or weapons that have been reclaimed
There is a stone desk on the far end and there
within this office already accompanied by a
messenger dressed for immediate travel is a toughlooking 
dwarven woman in her middle years rapidly
scrawling on parchment Her black hair is streaked
with silver tumbling past her red and gray
leather armor She finishes writing on this
parchment rolls it up and hands it to the
messenger who immediately darts out of the room
without a word past you guys giving you a brief
look as he continues on whatever his business is
As soon as your eyes pass off the messenger you
hear a loud slam and you glance back Shes put
her hands on the table She glances up All
right what riffraff have you brought in to me
this day The watchmaster takes the chains of the
three of you and pulls you to the front of the
group and says Sorry to be a bother but we have
three individuals arrested in connection with as
you have heard so far the deaths at the carnival
performance this evening She rolls her eyes
All right bring them forward They go ahead and
pull the chains up The watchmaster bows his head
and then leaves the room She steps forward and
goes I am Norda It is my job to keep this city
safe and keep shite like what happened tonight
from happening I approved your second time on the
outskirts of our town and you have killed two of
my people What have you to say about yourselves
 She glances over at you Glances over at
Gustav I have been told by my guard that you
gave performance and as part of this performance
you released two beasts into the midst of the
population
 Gustav interrupts you and says Im so
sorry my liege Please I take full
responsibility for what happened this evening on
myself These people around me had nothing to do
with this They are not part of the carnival they
were just merely helping It is my carnival and
whatever judgement there lies I take upon myself
and my head At which point Bo the halforc steps
forward against his chains and goes Gustav
what are you doing Hes like Shut Up Please
whatever judgement there is put it upon me and
he bows his head low Is that the case Is he the
only one She takes a good hard look at you and
Bo the Breaker
 Make a persuasion check
 She gives you a look Looks over at Bo the
Breaker Shakes her head Keep these two
downstairs This one let go He seems to be free
Well be talking to you very soon At which
point the crownsguard drag the chains back and
Gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and
goes as theyre pulled out of the room out of
sight She glances to you Well youre out of
chains Thats great Doesnt mean youre absolved
of the investigation So where are you staying
You and your compatriots
 Well technically as far as Im concerned
youre all together as part of this
investigation
 So were going to have our investigators
come to wherever youre staying which and she
looks down at some papers here  looks to be
the Nestled Nook
 All right Dont leave the city Well be
in touch
 Do you have something to say
 Good Dismissed She claps the edge of the
table The remaining crownsguard whos left there
to keep watch escorts you out off the stockade
escorts you onto the street
 Sorry
 Yeah but youd have to stay within  feet
to maintain that
 You did hear all that Okay and Id say as
theyre making their way out you can probably
duck around without them seeing you as they left
Yeah you can do that So you guys are jettisoned
into the street Its now probably just past
midnight
 You hear the footfalls of guards approach
and the rattle of chains as you see Beauregard
 As opposed the rest of you who are gingerly
brought up you see Beauregard being pulled
forward but now the chains around her are being
pulled taught on two sides Shes being brought
forward like a wild animal almost
 And shes just being led towards the
stockade
 Which is the last thing you see as she is
yanked into the stockade and out of sight
 You walk in behind her You watch her being
pulled to the stairs Shes bypassing the office
of the Lawmaster right now and is being brought to
incarceration before being questioned They bring
her to the stairs and a torchlit subterranean
basement area As you begin to approach and follow
behind you can see one of the guards who is
currently on watch He sees you guys just exit and
then walk back in following another prisoner And
stands up and goes Im sorry where are you
going
 Well see her into her cell and please exit
the vicinity
 Appreciate that He follows behind you
guys Theyre on high alert and theyre a bit
scattered You get the sense right now that they
have a lot of their initial stock of guards
offsite right now So theyre doing the best they
can to hold on to what they currently have in the
stockade
 You guys follow down to the basement portion
of this Which theres a heavy locked door
immediately that is opened from the opposite side
You hear a couple of keys turn and the shifting of
wood against metal before the door opens and
reveals the rest of a long hallway that is flanked
by two rows of cells Iron bars about maybe two
inches apart going across the entirety of this
long hallway You cant quite see the end of it
until you step down to where the door frame is
And there is probably a total of ten cells to each
side As you walk through you can see in the off
shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies
hunched or asleep Keeping to the shadows and out
of the light The smell of mildewed wet compost
and piss hits your nose like a wall
 You get about five cells in where you can
see the guard that was previously in there just
finish off closing the cell that contains both
Gustav and Bo the Breaker They move to the cell
just beyond that open that cell and then go
ahead and put Beauregard into that one
 As he closes and locks it Because she
decided not to come helpfully
 The three guards walk away not caring Who
were there previously and
 At this point a man who is on the far end
of the hall walks up And you can see him hes a
man with a heavy bushy beard that obscures a lot
of a dark leather mantle over a general cloth
tunic He has burly arms heavy torso super
scrawny legs a widows peak and he looks to be
the jailer He walks up and puts his hand on the
bars and goes Oh well if you want to be
patient Im sure the Lawmaster will be here
sometime in the morning and you can discuss
whatever this business is But if you want to say
goodbye nows the time
 Thats sixteen kittens Kittens have half of
a hit point I dont think kittens have more than
that
 Make a persuasion check
 He gives you a look and says All right
but if she gets angry its not on me
 He gives a whistle Another crownsguard
comes up and approaches him and he goes Im
sorry Could you go and fetch the Lawmaster They
are requesting an audience If she gets angry
just add it to this ones sentence The guard
exits and a brief time by you can hear the slight
muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the
stairs You can see she has an overcoat on was
halfway out of the stockades finishing up her
evening in her office
 So as the Lawmaster approaches now pulling
the coat over herself she goes Okay so youve
returned apparently needing to poke into what
business now before I go off and get some food
 I hate being troubled twice in the same
evening
 Okay I would like a deception check
 Modified by their answers
 She gives a narrow look through her eyes
looks to one of the other guards that you can see
standing in the back a familiar one to you Beau
and goes Is this true He goes It appeared to
us that she was attempting to escape upon us
trying to bring calm to a very tense situation
but Ill leave it in your realm Lawmaster She
looks back So your sister apparently is part
of this scenario as well
 Okay Well your sisters under
investigation
 At which she looks to you now and goes Are
you saying you might have been infected by this
beast
 Theeds And she looks over to the jailer
who goes Aye And she goes Could you have a
look at this wound for me real fast I want to
make sure this isnt something thats going to
spread
 The jailer Theeds takes a quick look at
the wound and he goes No it appears to mainly
be just bludgeoning I mean well keep a close
eye on her You can see now the Lawmaster is
rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes I just
want to sleep
 Fine Well have guards posted at the
outside of the inn Youre not to leave until this
investigation is complete It may take days Until
we find out whos responsible for these deaths and
bring them to justice you are not to leave the
tavern
 Not until this is done
 Because otherwise youre welcome to stay
here instead
 Get them the fuck out She turns around
and sighs heavily as she stomps out of the
chamber The jailer opens the cell door and allows
Beauregard back out and he looks a bit confused
but amused at the same time The guards that had
originally arrested you escort you out not
leaving any element of their sight off of you
They escort you guys to the actual inn itself to
the bottom floor of the Nestled Nook Inn watch
you enter and then post up right outside the main
entrance to the tavern
 Are you guys up in your room or are you in
the tavern
 Youve come through once but that was a
while back and you werent really paying
attention
 You spot around the interior of the tavern
They dont appear to be nearby
 Okay Yorda
 Oh hi Everything all right You had a few
bruiser types leading you in here some of the
crownsguard huh
 I heard about that I didnt go in there
but people are coming in here saying
 I heard that Thats incredible
 Yeah they came in not but a few minutes
before you did They went upstairs
 Meanwhile the two of you are upstairs in
your own chambers
 You guys head down You get to the bottom of
the stairs just in time to see Jester Beauregard
Molly and Fjord looking across the tavern making
their way in your direction and you guys notice
them meeting you in the tavern room as well
 Sure
 You look over and see a woman with darker
hair the general barmaid Adelaine
 Go with the von Brandt
 We can get you some liquor aye
 All right She walks away
 They are keeping a tally of the table
 Make an investigation check
  Everything seems to be in order for
you
 Everything seems to be in order
 Whats on your waist
 All right make a sleight of hand check
 You close your eyes and feel a tug and a
shake
 Whats your passive perception
 So yeah you totally feel
 Do you give him the gold
 Perception check
 You watch that copper piece become silver
magically
 Being about one oclock in the morning at
this time and the energy in the tavern has come
to a quiet crawl those who are keeping their cups
are either snoring or in the process of preparing
to go to sleep you watch as Adelaine the
barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and
suddenly all the windows in the room slam open
with a heavy impact and theres a burst of wind
that comes through The two crownsguard that were
outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush
and look in and look about at the lot of you
 They both just slowly curl back to their
perimeter
 Theres some claps in the back rooms You
see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to
semiconsciousness and goes Thats impressive

Then passes back out on the table
 You concentrate for a moment Make a
medicine check
  You focus on the bruised area exposed
out of her monk robes You watch as the slight
bruising suddenly turns like a sickly green
 In a very unhealthy way
 Right now shes inspecting it You take a
fork off the table and poke
 She pushes it in and the bruise hurts a bit
You watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour
out with a thick viscosity and a lot of it You
all of the sudden feel like youve punctured a
balloon thats beginning to erupt and you feel
awful Then you blink a few times and its just a
bruise You hear this distant 
 No you werent part of that formal
instruction The rest of you were told not to
leave the tavern until further notice
 All righty Fairly decent sketches
actually You eventually find yourself to sleep
The rest of you go to your respective rooms and
find yourselves falling into a nights rest As
evening comes to a close and the morning brings
you to consciousness you are rested You are
healed up your spells are restored
 Coming to consciousness in your respective
rooms cold morning air Its a bit frosty The
windows to each of your rooms have a bit of that
curled bit of frost on the outskirts of the glass
point in time and the day is yours What do you
wish to do
 As a note too for all the drinks you guys
drank last night that probably put you back about
one and a half gold
 Yes you may
 This would be deception
 All right
 Sure
 Okay the two of you come to consciousness
What are you up to
 Youve already gone down there
 Okay
 As you guys wander down you find Caleb and
Nott already at a table and Mollymauk returning
from the bar after delivering that note
 It means he can use to try and disguise
himself Hide features
 Yeah upstairs at the very end of the hall
is the communal washroom
 Sure what form so you want to take
 Okay easily enough Basic browns and tans
and general farm workers tunic and supplies
 Yeah easy enough
 All right Go ahead and make a dexterity
check
 If you want to
 So take it with advantage
  okay You actually manage to sell a
decent disguise
 At a distance at like three or four feet
would be passable and walking quickly by Upon
close inspection you could see through it
 More or less
 A medieval version of that
 But impressive Using the kit and using
whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass
you manage to get a relatively topknot Silverlake
hobo version of Beau functionally ready to go
 Okay Just doublechecking here Disguise
Self lasts for is it an hour Yeah I thought it
was an hour So while theyre doing that are you
using your disguise kit on yourself
 Yeah with a cloak and hood and makeup you
can probably pass for human as long as you keep
the hood up and keep most of your more
ostentatious garb hidden
 Go ahead and make a dexterity check for your
disguise kit
 All right Between making your skin tone
more of a natural tan peach humanoid color bring
the hood up You actually pull some of your hair
forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so
that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the
front You manage to tuck in and tie your robe
behind you your usual clothing and then using an
overrobe to hide most of the material and you
look like a dude passing through So with that
your disguises are complete your spells are cast
 Okay As you exit there are two gentlemen
in full crownsguard gear One is standing outside
the other is currently sitting in a chair and as
soon as you walk past they both scan you up and
down continue to watch you pass by
 Just the two that you can see at the front
yes
 Okay in what order are you leaving
 I imagine you guys have been using your
disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers
Other than that no one immediately seems to be
noticing Make a perception check
 You do see Yorda the barkeep in the
process of wiping out some glasses at the end
shes occasionally giving a glance over to you
guys as youre walking around
 Ill say for the purpose of this each of
you make a performance check
 Okay The both of you exit out holding your
breath Out of your peripheral you can see the
deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor
flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the
tavern stepping down into the dust to the main
street You curve to the left and see nor hear any
reaction from either of them
 It may not have been the snitch after all
you asshole
 Apparently All right you saunter by
without an issue By saunter I mean you stumble
through You hear a cough at one point and it
causes you a moment but you just continue on
without notice
 You guys dont have to make a performance
check because youve exited before and youre
completely visually a different individual so you
guys pass through without an issue Caleb you can
follow up behind as you are not currently under
direct guard in the tavern They do notice you
exit and theyre aware of your presence but you
are not confined to the tavern So you guys all
manage to slowly come together a few blocks down
and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding
the Nestled Nook Inn and where are you off to
 They dont have a large bazaar but there is
an area that is generally where a lot of the
simple wares and vegetables and meats and people
who sell small things that they craft their own
at its a small market If you want to make an
investigation check
 Okay by going around asking questions and
inquiring and trying to prod people to talk about
what transpired the night before the information
you gather involves the man who passed away His
name is Enon Brinjay
 Brinjay Hes a standard human being in his
early s Hes old but healthy it seemed
 Seemed to be in good health for his age
 Apparently
 He seemed to have been retired for quite
some time but had been making little bits here
and there helping the fishermen move fish to and
from the outside of the lake He wasnt really
well known The reason people are talking about
him now is because the word is gotten around and
gossiped about but for the most part he was one
of the many faceless people that live in the town
A handful knew his name
 Actually he was known often to be drinking
at The Old Mud Hole Tavern
 No just old
 I know
 You dont find any of that information That
would be an intense investigation You would have
to go beyond asking questions around a market
 Its technically considered part of the
city It might not be an issue
 The Mud Hole Tavern youve been to before
 Yeah when you first entered the city so
you can
 The Lochward is where the Old Mud Hole would
be at The Lochward is to the eastern side of the
entire city The Lochward is the central one
 So you make your way to the Old Mud Hole
Entering inside this is a dark dive of a bar
youve been there once before It smells heavily
of old wet wood ale stains and peanut Its a
very small area and of the four tables that are
there they are mostly empty except for one old
man who is sitting there in the process of playing
a game of solitaire with his cards and a man in
his s thumbing through a book who would be the
barkeep if there were more patrons at the moment
Hes flipping through and glances up and gives you
a look as you enter Can I help you Are you
looking for drinks Can I get you anything
 We have liquor
 I will get some whiskey for you then
Whiskey everyone
 Make a deception check
 He goes and lines up a few small containers
fills whiskey for all of you All right that
will be eight silver for the batch
 He takes the silver and puts it away slides
the drinks to the rest of you and goes back to his
book and starts thumbing through again
 He looks up and goes Enon its sad to see
him go and many of us were wondering what day it
was going to be
 He came in here most every day to drink
Hes a lonely man
 Doesnt bother me one way or the other
Just sad to lose a patron
 I dont recall Sometimes he would tell
stories to whoever was willing to listen and not
most were willing to listen
 Yesterday
 I think he came in briefly for a drink
before the carnival but that was it
 Its this very whiskey you just had
 I dont believe he was ill I hope not He
seemed to be rather wasting away You shouldnt be
doing so much manual labor at that age
 He carries stuff around from small tasks
to
 The docks up at the North Ward He carried
crates boxes Just odd jobs ways to get by til
the end of his days which now that theyve come
may he rest and not have to do odd jobs ever
again He pours his own bit of whiskey
 To be honest if he did I wasnt paying
attention
 Theres nobody nearby He had a son about
 years ago but he got married and went up
north
 I dont know Maybe
 He points over to the not the table the guy
is playing solitaire on but the empty table to
the right of him Usually right there in the
corner
 Okay make an investigation check
  It looks like probably old person
touching has been all over here Yes The table is
very old and warped in places stains all over it
Its not a very good table Its seen some rough
days
 I apologize I served him drinks and
pretended to listen to him many times but I
wasnt really paying attention
 Maybe I apologize I spend most of my days
reading He lifts the book
 At a glance at it its in Zemnian which
you can read The translation would come about to
The Rosed Embrace
 Probably
 Its not trashy Its very tasteful
 Have you
 I didnt realize there was another Samuel
fan in here Which is your favorite
 I havent read that one
 What is it again He goes over and grabs a
piece of chalk in the back and starts It was
 Mein Gott I did not know about this I may
have to send out Zadash and see if we can find
some of those books Thank you
 Just recently Samuel I read on occasion
It depends on what you can find
 The parchment place is good for trash If
youre looking for unique stuff theres a few
places you can go
 Here in town yeah If youre having a hard
time finding a specific book I would recommend
going to Burnished Bibelots
 That is in the North Ward just on the
outskirts of the main market street Its a bit of
a cluttered mess but Oglen would be happy to help
you
 Oglen
 Not to worry
 I imagine so It cant be that bad
 Of course I have a contact in Rexxentrum
If I cannot find it in Zadash I will get it from Rexxentrum
 Whats your name
 Caleb Pleasure to meet you I am Vosna
 Of course If anybody else is a reader as
well come by and talk sometime
 Pictures are up in here
 Okay
 Correct
 Are you a devil
 I dont play with devils
 Enon wanted to go to that bloody circus
 I told him not to go Stupid it is for the
common folk and the young Hes always had his
head in the clouds
 Other people are stupid
 Hes lonely Dont trust the carnival
Nothing but spooks and magicians and things that

kidney beanshaped lake
 Do you speak Zemnian
 Do you know
 I just wanted to fuck with you
 Essentially it just means an east lake
 Not too complicated

Ustaloch and the Dockward there well go and take

Thanks Sam Congratulations to AvilynRain
AvilynRain in the Twitch chat You won the awesome
Wyrmwood prize package Danoba will be in contact
with you to get your contact information and get
that sent out to you Congratulations
 Yeah we did Most of them As you guys make
your way across the streets of the Lochward you
find yourself to the docks which are about five
or six main dock structures that protrude anywhere
from ten to  or so feet into the loch itself
There are no major ships The biggest river that
exits the loch heads towards the mountains so
there is no direct path to the inlet All the
boats in here are small fishermens boats theyre
designed specifically for the lake for freshwater
fishing and whatever needs to be transferred from
bank to bank As you approach you can see a good
amount of the boats are still out on the water
You can look out and see the outline of them
against the horizon You see a couple of small
landmasses in the center of the loch that are
barely out of view You approach and the first
couple of fishermen that walk past you both look
to be hardened in their years Their skin is very
battered by the sun its wrinkled and dark from
constant beating of the sky upon them They glance
over at this uniquelooking troupe as they
approach They stop and dont say anything they
just look at you like What are you doing here
 You have it for maybe ten more minutes
 Crownsguard Make a perception check
 Glancing about you dont see any
crownsguard in the immediate vicinity of the
Lochward Youve seen them they patrol the town
and walk through ward to ward but you dont see
any at the moment no
 You remember where he lives mostly because
you were there
 You guys make your way along the edge of the
loch to the outside of the fishermans house The
house is currently being repaired You can see in
the main doorway the door is off the hinges and
theres a large pile of ruined furniture and
cabinets that have been shifted out of the
building You can also see a long serpentine
body that is currently being skinned by a younger
man probably  or  Hes in the process of
carving the skin off of it This thing is about 
to  feet long
 As you approach the young man with this
large sharpened knife it looks like it may have
been a heavy butchering knife that hes using to
fillet and pull the skin off the snake Looks back
at you guys and doesnt know whats going on You
hear a voice go Hey You look up and you see
the fisherman that you saw before the one who
came to you guys in the tavern Hes up on top of
the roof and hes currently boarding some
portions of it It looks like a part of the roof
had been damaged in the fray He goes Hold on
gets up and comes down the ladder on the side and
approaches You can see hes sweating Im so
sorry I didnt know you were coming What can I
do for you
 No actually This is an interesting point
 Thats right no thank you for reminding
me He comes out and he goes How can I help
you

 He goesAh
 Im very confused
 Rinaldo
 No weve been doing repairs on the house
and getting everything underway This is the first
thing thats come on this side Most of them live
toward the center of the lake and stay underwater
Its been two in the last few months that have
come up Its a bit of a nuisance
 Zombies What are you talking about
 Enon
 Yeah I worked with him a couple times He
comes through looking for work asking to see
whats available
 No Thats the big blue tent right
 No whats going on
 Im sorry to hear that Thats terrible
Wow thats really terrible Im sorry
 I havent seen him at the docks in a while
Not for a week at least
 Other than a giant fucking snake ruining my
house but not that comes to mind no Circus
coming into town thats a little weird
 Im not going to let it go to waste Thats
some good meat Some good skin
 Because theres a circus in town
 Yeah We dont get many shows and traveling
folk Last time this was here a year ago it came
and went in a week
 No I didnt keep up with him He came
through every now and then I had a little cash
and needed some help hauling things around I
asked for his assistance He was an old fella and
it was less that he was helpful and more that we
wanted to help when we could
 Your guess is as good as mine To be fair
although were a community were also relatively
competitive You understand
 I dont think so Hes an old man I
havent seen or heard anyone his disposition
seemed positive enough if a little sad and
lonely
 Of course Let me finish up here with the
roof and Ill ask around see if anything comes up
 It just wasnt expected
 No shes doing great Shes been a little
spooked but she slept well last night Shes
doing fine Thank you again for what you guys did
for me
 I will You were so kind to help me when I
saw a snake I figure if I see a zombie youd
also be helpful
 You can inspect it if you want
 Make a nature check
 Nine You dont know much about snake
biology Its hard to tell if its out of the
ordinary Its just a big snake
 What are you guys doing Where are you
going
 Yeah
 I cant say I do Im sorry My apologies
Wish I could be of more help
 I didnt even know he had a son
 He climbs back up the ladder to the roof
 He has this puffy red fro going on He
looks pale fresh to this scrawny Hes stopped
drawing his blade across the snake Yeah
 No I live about three houses up
 Last night Yeah I was there
 I actually snuck in under the tent after it
had started
 I saw him a little bit He was in the front
and I had people in front of me but I think I saw
some of it It was pretty cool
 My grandma told me a ghost story years ago
about these giant badger creatures that live on
the hills of the Ashkeeper that can stand up on
their hind legs and they come down and they eat
kids that dont go to bed in time
 No not since that
 I have to finish the
 Okay
 Yeah you guys were at the docks
 Yeah its about to fade
 Probably
 Its a twostory You guys are up in the
second story
 All right so you guys are setting up a rope
to climb up the back You go in on your own up
to the top you put a rope through
 Easy enough to do so those of you who want
to wait and can take the rope up you wait for a
moment where nobodys watching and climb your way
up into the inn safely and get to your rooms You
two what are you doing
 All right
 Okay that would be probably closer to the
Northward
 Okay make an investigation check
 If you want to
 You aiding him would give him an advantage
in the roll
 You take a couple hours wandering through
the Northward asking questions and most of the
information you get is they have no idea who that
is or like Ah he died Its about time
 Id say yeah based on that roll
 I believe you are correct Yeah its in the
southern portion of the Northward by where it
borders the Lochward
 Easily enough You eventually are led to it
and you come to a closet thats affixed to another
building The wood used are almost driftwood and
heavily weathered and the front door is closed as
you approach It looks like a glorified storage
shed that has been bolted and put up against
another structure
 Okay  No response
 Visual glance there look like theres that
space underneath the door
Probably not enough for a cat to slip through
 There are windows but if you look at the
back of the windows all you see is scraps of
material stacks of books piles of boxes and
crates its literally blocked out with things
stacked up against it from the interior
 Not busy at all its just the two of you
right now standing at the front door
 Its not on the main street its a little
pushed back recessed about ten or  feet from
the main road so theres no one immediately around
you But there are people walking back and forth
on the road behind but youre out in the open per
se
 No ones come to the door yet no
 Okay A moment passes and you hear Hold
on The door opens It was open Theres the
sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the
interior of it and you glance around and you hear
a voice go Can I help you
 You look down and theres this
crotchetylooking scrawny old gnome whos sitting
there in the doorway Hes got this vibrant puff
like a cotton ball of hair around his head But
its this perfect U of bald on top No glasses
eyes are very small and beady and he has this
bulbous round nose at the front with this little
bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the
cotton ball tuft on the sides Hes sitting there
clutching the top of the knob on the inside which
is actually affixed shorter on the door and he
goes Well come in
 Always open come on in
 Turns around and musters his way inside As
soon as you step in the door and look around this
place looks like an episode of Hoarders It is
just floortoceiling walltowall stacks of
stuffed animals toys books glasses and
goblets It is the biggest crammed fleamarket
into a small shedlike space youve seen
 
 Well weve got books here
 Oglen Oglen Hornsblower
 And welcome to my collection You want to
buy something let me know
 Right Boughten traded for found
 Im sure weve got a few Look around See
what you find Its half the fun half the
journey
 Make an investigation check
 
 All right
 All right In thumbing through there are
plenty of books that within a first glance
This is not of interest to me You have to move things
out of the way and push things aside
The smell in there is dusty and moldy 
and you do find there is
some subtle water damage and some mildew growing
in one far corner and youre like ugh put that
back However you rolled really high Two things
catch your eye One there appears to be the
remnants of some sort of notebook a sketchbook
that is written in a language you do not
understand What languages do you know
 It does take ten minutes
 But you glance through the book and while
you cannot read the text you do recognize that
there are elements at the back of the book that
have a hint of arcane nature Thats one of two
books you find with that roll
 I know The second book you find is written
in Zemnian which you can read
 The title translates to Fiends of Folklore
 I know I do
 Good choices good choices
 Thats too bad
 Hes pulling the books away from you
  He holds of the Fiends of Folklore
book Three gold pieces This one 
ten gold pieces
 The Fiends of Folklore is the three the
other tome
 Youre not quite sure whats in it
 Im sorry
  He like throws the books and grabs
nearby this large sack and starts
angrily beating the cat
 He does hit Frumpkin Frumpkin takes one
point of bludgeoning damage
 Yes
 There you go Frumpkin immediately darts off
jumps on your shoulder turns around and

 Sorry it caught me offguard
 Okay
 Can you make him go away
 Thank you Now we can continue to talk
money
 Of course Sorry about your cat friend
 Youve been hearing all of it but youve
also found amongst the chaos a brass baby bottle
thats fairly dented but its very shiny and
polished you can already see on the inside You
find a new flask actually Its very tarnished
but you spit and rub it a little bit It looks to
be of very fine metallic material Youre not
entirely sure youd have to clean it but it
looks like very nice quality material
 Make a sleight of hand check
 Now your flask which still has liquor in
it is left behind for the empty flask you
receive However without an instance of anyone
even paying attention It is yours You can write
in your inventory you are now the owner of a
platinum flask
 Baby bottle Looks like it was used as a
bottle for a very upperclass family
 Make another sleight of hand check please
 It just vanishes into your cloak Its the
craziest thing It was there and its gone
 Ill hold these books for you Come back
when you can
 All right Have a good day little girl
 You guys exit the building
 You glance throughout the interior and you
dont sense anything magical unfortunately
within the piles of rubble
 The books not radiating any magical aura
But he answers Oh All hours I dont really
close I dont really sleep
 Sure
 No worries See you then
 Pee shmiter
 No he does not
 While theyre away you guys wait there for
a bit getting stir crazy in the process of
waiting in your room Jester and Beauregard
theres a knock at your door
 Please open its Crownsguard
 The door opens and there are two
crownsguards there standing shields to the
side
 Were here to notify you that the
investigation is ongoing You will not be needed
today Please remain in your premises Be back
tomorrow
 Yes you are
 Yes what is your question
 Possibly
 They look at each other look back at you
I am Jonas The other guy pipes up hes a
little younger he goes I am Lucas
 Very well Have a good day They look at
each other like What and close the door
 Onto Fjords door
 Same two guards there Lucas and Jonas
Jonas and Lucas Hello The investigation is
ongoing Youll not be needed for today We will
return tomorrow
 Theres a pause and then you here the subtle
shifting of greaves against the wooden floor as
they slowly walk away
 You guys return to the inn
 Yes you do
 
 At one point Adelaine the barmaid comes up
Im sorry can you please stop
 Thank you
 Yes
 Not that you noticed unfortunately
 Hemp rope can be pretty heavy
 This is true
 It was one block north of the Natural
Remedies
 Yeah Jackalwere Smiths
 There is no window in the hall only in the
rooms
 You have three rooms between you
 Correct
 Not medical tape but there are clean strips
of cloth and some adhesive bandages basic
general
 You can pull one bandage out and affix to
one of the chair legs nearby You could do that
 Okay so you toss the room a bit muddle up
the space and you guys one by one climb out the
back of the window down the rope and into the
alley behind the inn Looking about youre
waiting until about postmidnight you said
 Okay so its dark The various lanterns
that dangle on the hook poles at different
intersections of the street are lit Other than
that you have a faint bit of moonlight thats
coming through the sky There are some clouds but
theyre a bit broken up so every now and then the
moon cover can vanish and then return but for now
you have moonlight in the city Where are you guys
going
 A little ways north of Natural Remedies
Okay I would like everybody to make a stealth
check please
 You guys following Nott dodge between
alleys there are a few patrols of the crownsguard
that you see passing by and you wait for them to
just cross paths and then move on Eventually
finding your way to Natural Remedies seemingly
unseen Its quiet you can hear the sound of
crickets in the distance The cold night air is
causing your breath to show every time you exhale
you all bundle your cloaks as you move on The
moonlight fades a bit things get darker but you
follow Notts lead travel from place to place
You finally get to the outskirts of Natural
Remedies and to the northern alleyway where youd
originally seen those figures pass Youre there
 As you guys fan out a little bit everyone
make a perception check
 Okay so all of you except for Jester
manage to get a clear view of your vicinity
Jester you somehow get an eyelash caught in your
eye and spend the next hour trying to get it out
but its in the eyelid
 Occasionally you can hear the crownsguard
approaching and they carry their torches with
them You can see the light crawling forward so
you all duck out of the way and let them pass
About an hour passes Two hours pass Around the
third hour you get the sensation that whatever
you saw the other night is not arriving on a
clockwork time or not arriving at all Its about
three in the morning in the center of the city by
yourself What do you wish to do
 Yeah
 Okay
Make an intelligence check
 Pouring over the details of what has
transpired and what you guys have done so far to
find information there are still things to
inquire about There are still things to wonder
and discover and there are a few places you
havent been to A few places you havent returned
to A few people you havent even inquired about
closer to the investigation
 From the inn About a  minute jog
 Make a performance check
 It takes a little convincing to have them
see the poop in the drawing You can see it but
youve seen better
 It helps but
 Whos going where What are you guys doing
 All right I would like for all of you to
roll a stealth check
 Okay you guys make your way through most of
the Docksward on your way to the large blue tent
that still stands ominously in the distance
Thankfully the moon has come out and cast this
rimlight against the structure so its easy to
see As you guys are making your way outside of
the Lochward you immediately see the approaching
torchlight of crownsguard One of them you just
faintly hear  or  feet ahead of you Who goes
there
 Its two guards side by side These watches
they patrol in pairs
 You guys are keeping off to the side Youre
all on the outskirts of the lake and almost made
your way out of the city towards where the
 You do as well
 All right So you both become crownsguard
Youve all of a sudden are adorned in the goldish
brass and red armor
 There are some small alcoves but you guys
are out in the open now Theyve seen you
 You dont know Theyve seen you Theyve
called to you and then both of you guys
disguised yourselves What are you doing
 Jester walks up and wades in about six
inches of water and just gives her best duck
impression
 Make a deception check
 Yes
 Sure make a deception check
 Okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see
this they go Shit They pull their blades and
they start charging you Nott to try and protect
their other crownsguard
 All right as you rush up in a jog blades
drawn one of them is going to go ahead and
attempt to strike
 That is going to be a  to hit
 So you manage to  and narrowly
dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of
your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden
pole that is on the outside of an overhang where
some of the fish are being left out to dry and
turn into fish jerky It holds you in place as
youre snarling and looking scared The other one
pulls out his blade and says Where did this thing
come from
 All right you take one point of bludgeoning
damage Nott and blood just  from
the nose
 I need you to make a deception check on that
one
 You see a look of disappointment come across
the two crownsguards faces in their inability to
help you skewer this small feral creature They
both put their blades away All right if you see
anything else give a shout 
 They both continue their walk past the rest
of you
 They look over at the tiefling partially
crouched in the water
 Hey Not in the Ustaloch

 Your legs are soaked from thigh to foot and
they both eye you warily and slowly walk past
 Eventually they pass beyond a point where
you feel absolute dread of their presence
 All right you guys are make the rest of the
path to the outskirts of the circus You see at
the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard
whos like  sitting there his arms crossed
to the front keeping an eye out he is doing
lateshift You do see the faint distant
flickering glow of firelight from the back side of
the circus
 Yeah you saw it earlier you saw the
campfire
 Yes
 All right so what are the groups here
 Molly who are you going with
 All right so the three of you are going
forward What are you doing I guess I should
ask
 Eh nothing yet Mostly I hate this Ugh I
just wish this whole fucking circus would just go
I need to sleep Regular hours
 Until they finish this fucking
investigation They keep bugging people for
information but theyre all just clammed up and
not saying shit
 Its bullshit I wish they would just go
ahead and execute them That carnival master or
whatever and get it over with
 They investigated the corpses and found
nothing yet Still in there if you want to take a
look at it
 I mean I suppose so Make a deception
check
 Okay He thinks a second on it Oh I
suppose so Go on in
 Please get it over with He stops you
If theres any way to expedite this if you can
pin it on any of them we can just kill them and
take care of it Let me know
 You guys look inside the tent is dark
Theres no light inside
 All right so you have this selfmade hooded
lantern with the hood you have over it
 Okay
 And Nott youre going with them
 You make your way inside the smell is
pretty bad You can smell the flesh beginning to
decay
 With a bit of looking the bodies are still
there where they left them They have not moved
you can see a couple of remnants of notes and
sheets that have been crumpled but the bodies
have been left where they are
 Go and make a religion check
 Unfortunately you dont have a lot of
research on the undead or whatever might be the
essence of this creatures creation and the more
you look at it youre like This is not my
specialty
 Make an investigation check both of you
 Glancing about you can see the track marks
of everyone fleeing You can see the spatters of
blood You can see the place where the
transformation occurred There is a horrible
shedding of certain layers of flesh You can see
previously existing layers of flesh and muscle
that were shed as whatever this undead thing was
fell to the ground Once again you make a
religion check as well
 Yeah This is not your specialty You have
little experience with the undead and this type of
magic
 Two of them Theres the main one the
ground zero one which is where you were putting
all your attention and then theres the woman
who was transformed as part of the first
 With a squishy sound you place it within
your pack
 All right The four of you I need you to
roll stealth checks please
 Without issue you guys quickly dart around
the side of the tent and make your way right
towards the central area where the multitude of
tents to this back encampment is placed There is
a single campfire The embers are burning out It
has not been kept up You do see two crownsguard
who are currently keeping watch One of them is
slumped in a chair across from the fire and is
nodding off The other is doing a basic patrol and
looking around Other than that you dont hear
any sounds you dont see anybody else Just the
two crownsguard
 There are four main tents There are two
very large ones one of which generally contains
Toya and Kylre the devil toad Thats on the
south side Theres the north largest tent this
one contains the Knot sisters and Ornna Then
theres a very small tent to the south side that
would be Bo the Breakers tent but hes not here
Then theres a medium sized tent on the north
side Who would be in that one
 Desmond would be the other one It would be
Gustav staying there as well but Gustav changes
between the tent and the cart
 Maybe  feet away from it
 Do you want to go to the north side or the
south side of the main tent
 The Toya tents on the south side thats
the opposite side you guys would have probably
come in from the north end
 That would be the one that contains Ornna
and the Knot sisters
 Okay Theres actually no response
 The other tent you get to and you make the
same sound This would be the one that Desmond
usually is in too Theres a pause and then you
hear a very faint 
 Okay You glance inside and you can see
leaning up from a bedroll Desmond who is
halfawake and glances over and sees you Hes
out of outfit out of makeup and he gives a nod
 Yeah
 Theyve come around asking a few questions
were trying to figure it out ourselves Are you
okay
 Hows Gustav And Bosun
 Were still trying to figure this out
ourselves Are you alone
 Well bring them in
 You guys all enter the tent and you see
Desmond Previously you saw him in this very
colorful outfit with the frilled neck piece and
the full facial makeup Now you see a man in his
late s with a very scarred left side of his
face It looks like it was shredded at one point
in his youth that the makeup hid during the
performance As soon as you enter even upon
greeting him he has a very sad presence to him
Even though youre all under the cover of night
and having this conspiratorial conversation he
has this melancholy about him that permeates the
space inside the tent He says So youre all the
ones that helped earlier Thank you It would have
been far worse if you hadnt
 Theyre thinking something about the show
Theyre thinking Gustav made this happen I dont
think its Gustav hes a good man He makes poor
choices and its plagued him his whole life you
can see it in his brow But good intentions have
grave consequences No one that good comes out of
Shady Creek Run without some mistakes behind them
but I dont see him doing this
 No
 Weird things All the time Were a bunch
of weird folk work with a lot of weird people
Bunch of strange freaks gathered to this show
 Yeah she apparently ran off
 The sisters are bitter but its no fault
of theirs
 Because the world is cruel
 I wish I could help them but it
 Magical whisper Cone of Whisper
 Have you been around Have you travelled to
see anything
 I dont know Ask them
 They dont seem to take much of a liking to
me anyway so I cant really tell you myself Im
sorry
 Theres a lot of people that dont like
me
 He looks at you and goes Same reason folks
probably dont like you youre different
 Other than those two everyone else is
here Were just keeping under watch until their
investigation is complete
 Okay
 So you cast it You concentrate You reach
down and grasp the bottom of your symbol that
hangs around your belt and theres a faint rush
of divine force given to your consciousness You
dont sense within  feet of you any fiendish or
celestial or fey or undead or aberration
 Nothing from this tent or within  feet
 Its like a radial thing
 There are two tents to the north Theres a
bigger one and a medium one The one that youre
in right now is the larger one to the north and
as such contains Actually no The one that you
guys are in right now is the medium one The one
that contains Desmond The larger one contains
both of the sisters and Ornna
 Correct The big tent is about ten to 
feet from the one youre in right now
 Okay Is everyone else staying inside or are
you going with her
 He thinks for a second I dont want this
all to fall on Gustav Hes done a lot of good for
all of us and the way theyre talking about the
investigation theyre looking to make a scapegoat
of this
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Another stealth check my friends
 With advantage
 Okay You guys make your way up to the edge
of the tent
 Right As you make your way over to the edge
of the tent where the sisters and Ornna are you
focus and concentrate Nothing from the radial
thing One of the guards whos standing up and
making a patrol looks over right as you duck
behind and you hear a Huh
 You guys all dodge under the tent just as
the guard begins to pass around You hear the
footsteps around As you step in you watch as the
two Knot sisters
 They both curl into a ball and stay really
quiet All of the sudden Ornna comes to
consciousness and 
the footsteps finish the circle
and then go back towards where the fire is
 Ornna leans in goes like Okay what is
going on
 What do you want to know
 I dont know I looked and I saw what you
saw
 This is Ornna yeah
 Shes like Right
 Well the sisters over here think its a
hit job but this isnt a hit job with zombies
Are you fucking kidding me
 Thats not surprising
 Theyre both just quietly curled up and
watching you guys talk
 Not yet If you want to ask them something
you can
 Make an insight check to find out
 This is a bit of a leap This goes about 
 feet south of where you are around the campfire
thats open
 Go ahead and make your stealth checks
guys
 Okay What was your insight check
  They both look nervous but just
untrusting of the scenario You cant read
anything deeper than that There is definitely a
hmm but you cant quite get a full bead on them
You guys as you curl around the outside theres
the one guard thats sitting in the chair by the
fire that goes like  and opens his eyes a
little bit and looks over in your direction
Jester and theres a brief moment where hes just
looking right at you Do you do anything
 Stands up
 Youre around you dont see anything
 Sorry he doesnt see you
 Okay As he stands up he goes toward you
and he goes for his blade and he has to make a
saving throw
 Which he does not make I dont think so
its like a six
 So he goes like
 Okay
 Make a persuasion check
 He doesnt seem to buy the dream thing but
hes like
 He doesnt go to sleep but he knows
youre there and hes keeping an eye but
hes not doing anything
 But hes definitely aware that youre
there
 Okay Really quickly just to check because
its Thats right Charm Person is not
 Okay Its at this point that you turn your
attention to the tent and focus There is a hefty
radiating warm fiendish source from the inside of
that large tent
 The cat goes 
 
 Turns around and sprays you and then keep
walking
 You guys carefully maneuver under the tent
As soon as you curl into the interior of the tent
you hear a very heavy 
 No its the one on the south side of it
 You see the slowly expanding and contracting
form of Kylre from the back side You see this
giant scaly somewhat oily exterior of the body
 
 Make a perception check
 Okay thats better You just stare right at
the body of this toad going Nope
 You glance and see a faint bit of a whitish
material from the crook of the arm You take a few
steps forward and glance from the side and you can
see asleep cradled in his large lizardman arms
Toya dwarf girl is curled up and asleep
peacefully
 Its the large source
 It could have been yeah
 The radiance is around the large creature
 The breathing stops and theres this
stillness in the interior of the tent
 You hear this faint sound of squeaking as
lubricated folds of lizardman flesh twist over
each other as the devil toads head kind of curls
back to look at you quietly the mouth slightly
ajar You can see rows of teeth and this bit of
drool down the edge of the chin onto the ground
What you want
 At which point the little girl  begins
  and rotates in his space He
takes up almost the entirety of this tent And
slowly rotates around inside Surprisingly quiet
for his size And still clutching Toya Toya sits
up and is like Whats happening 
 Hi
 She takes her braids and holds them with her
hands its almost a safety blanket she curls into
herself She looks about  or  This close you
can see she looks younger than she did from that
distance Whether it be the presence or the mature
voice But she seems pretty young But shes not
childlike
  Well
 I dont remember I got scared
 Thank you
 She begins to chuckle And the big toad
 I did It was really scary I didnt
like it at all I didnt do that did I
 No The guards are saying I probably did
that theyre saying I might have done that Its
interesting you notice now listening to her she
has this beautiful voice but her speaking voice is
very crackly It sounds almost damaged
 I sing a lot Its what keeps me alive
its what gets me money
 Yeah Its the one song I know
 It felt the same
 Its an old dwarven tune My mother taught
it to me before she passed
 Its a tale of the angels and how they came
from the realms beyond of the gods They granted
each to us our sparks of life
 It sounds vaguely religious but
 No not beyond the ordinary Then I saw
that poor man just start tearing through people I
got scared and Kylre helped me She puts her arm
up and pats and 
 They brought me into the circus I was up
in a city north of here far north of the Marrow
Valley and I was just on the streets singing And
this carnival came by and I met Gustav and he
invited me to join and thats how I met Kylre and
I met all these wonderful people
 No
 The newest people weve had are Mollymauk
and Yasha
 Comparatively Mollymauks been here almost
two years now
 He came after I did We both found our
voice together I was very scared and he wasnt
talking and together we helped each other learn to
have fun again
 No
 I didnt see anything
 At this point in time you notice 
Nott going Shoo Cah Go find help and you hear
a   Yeah
 Frumpkin starts heading back around towards
you
 Briefly as you keep concentrating Frumpkin
finds his way under the tent and comes up to you
 I hope not I know him and Ornna argue a
lot but
 Yeah So while theyre gone the two of you
are in the other tent with the sisters and Ornna
 Theyre both sitting there knees tucked to
their chest
 Yeah youre telling us
 Im sorry who are you
 The two halfling twins look at each other
and back at you
 Okay well I mean whatever you want to
know
 Mollys great why are you such a dick
 Make a deception check on that
 Okay They both All right so what are you
trying to do
 All right well get it over with Soon as
this is done were out
 Theyre not going to kill us all The
other goes Theyre not going to kill us all
 
 Thanks
 Oh you guys are going to the main tent
 Not too far away from where you were
because youre backing out the side of it So you
can go ahead and stealth around Make a stealth
check
 Nice and what did you get
 The two of you without issue make your way
around towards the large tent without being seen
 Nothing
 To be honest if its any easier its
probably Gustav
 It probably is you shut up Hes a prick
he doesnt know what hes doing hes going to run
this whole carnival into the ground I dont want
to take the fall for it we all get away on this
 Because hes in prison hes the leader
hes fucked this whole thing by letting this
happen
 Yeah Its impressive
 Ornna goes Yes
  Id say Bosuns a stand up guy if
a bit of a selfabsorbed dick at times And we all
knew Gustav was going to shit the bed sooner or
later I mean this is his karma I just dont
know how or why but I can guarantee you if this
was my carnival this shit wouldnt have happened
 Mmhmm
 Well first off I would have made sure
that we had better support from the guard before
this all happened so nobody else got killed
 Secondly I would have made sure that there
werent any old folks that made it in to fucking
turn into shit
 I dont know
 At which point the flap of the tent opens
up and its Jester
 The two Knot sisters immediately go Ornna
Is it you Did you kill that guy Ornnas like
I dont know what youre talking about What the
fuck is this Who the fuck are you
 Go for it
 Ornna goes To be perfectly honest I have
no idea whats going on Yall just came in here
started throwing accusations at me Gustav got
arrested Bosun got arrested Molly got
arrested Im glad you got off that But to be
perfectly honest this whole things a shit show
And the circus is probably not going to be the
same after this
 Insight check on Ornna
 Yeah Im sorry
 Kind of hard to read She seems genuinely
frustrated and caught off guard by this
 She looks at you Molly
 Fuck you
 Youre for real worried about this You
Theyre cunts But theyre not going to kill
anyone Desmonds a weird fellow Theres
something dark in his past you can see it in his
melancholy
 Theres some untrustworthy intelligence in
those lizard eyes of that devil
 Theres this moment of silence like Hes
supposed to be lizardfolk
 You guys what are you doing
  Nice As the cat darts under the
tent and makes its way through you glance over to
the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from
one of the tents and you watch as one of the
guards whos sitting in the chair stands up and
crumples onto the ground without a sound You see
the other guard look over go over and run up to him
and start to check on him You guys hear a voice
in the back start saying Damon Damon
 You watch as the dark figure spins and two
flashes of red in the shadow nearby and you watch
as the other guard suddenly grabs his head and
grasps at his chest and falls on his back as his
legs curl up
 It is to the east of you about  feet
 Correct You watch as the shadow bounds like
a giant frog
 northward
 You guys hear the name calling and then
silence once more
 You guys go ahead and you look just as the
guard on the ground is like  and just
stops moving You see all the veins bulging
 As you come out of the tent you watch as
the flesh on his neck and throat splits and a very
familiar transformation begins to take place as
both of the guards begin to 
 As you guys rush underneath the big blue
tent you watch as the two guards that are quickly
bulging and mutating bits of their flesh
dislodging from their body and falling You watch
now up close similar to the last time but now
that you are looking intently for this you can
see where there should be blood its almost like
dust and sand begin to spill from the wounds
Something you had noticed a little bit in the body
of the old man before but you didnt know if it
was decomposition or just general dirt
 You watch as the two halflings are like
Fuck no
 The two mutated guards now their armor
bulging and broken in places turn to the noises
in the tent where you guys are
 You guys are all in one tent with the other
girls You are all jammed into the space The two
of you make your way outside of the large tent as
you watch these two bulging zombified creatures
making their way towards the tent And thats
where were going to pick up next time

 Because it is  now
 It looks like it leapt about  to  feet
in the air and traveled about  feet with the
leap It was a large arc
 You saw it escape northward from where you
are
 Yasha ran north northeast This is just
straight north of where you are
Towards the Ustaloch
 No
 No they just suddenly began to erupt in
 Look at that silver lining
 Thatll be fun
 Well pick up there next week The chase is
on apparently Thank you guys so much for being
awesome Thank you guys for coming along and
watching with us Well pick this up next Thursday
where we left off right in the middle of this
campsite Until then have a wonderful week See
you guys then And is it Thursday yet
Goodnight


 Welcome back Last we left off this
intrepid band of slowly converging individual
stories into some semblance of an adventuring
party have found themselves caught up in an
investigation There was a carnival you attended
which Mollymauk was a part of that had a terrible
scenario occur An older man who was at the
carnival had been transformed in the middle of a
performance into some horrible undead creature
that attacked and assaulted other people within
the tent You defeated it and since have all been
under investigation and been told you cant leave
the town To try and absolve yourselves of any
sort of doubt youve begun to investigate what
the cause is for this strange transformation
Youve gone around the town asking questions
meeting individuals eventually finding yourselves
back at the tent in the middle of the night past
midnight in the early hours of the morning
sneaking into tents and asking members of the
carnival what they may know about what has
transpired Upon speaking with a number of members
of the carnival two of the guards that were on
site suddenly fell dead where they were standing
writhing in pain as they passed You watched as a
large shadow which you had confirmed being
fiendish in nature leapt northward towards the
Ustaloch and out of sight as both Fjord and Caleb
rushed out of the main tent to see the center of
the camp where these two bodies begin to rise up
two more of the freshly transformed undead
creatures now angered and looking about for
something to feast upon And that was where we
left off
 Okay there you go So how many spells do
you have left
 Well
 I would like you all to roll initiative
please
 Yeah
 All righty  to 
 Beau at the top  to 
 Ten to five
 That it is You
 So Five
 The good news is they didnt roll very high
either but still better than a lot of you And
then three and three
 Okay there we go
 You watch as these two zombified guards
their brasscolored scale armor clanking as their
forms rise up looking around peer past the
shadowed darkness around the campfire lighting the
interior The horses grow nervous as you watch
both Caleb and Fjord emerge from the tent right in
their sights You watch as they both 
begin to lumber in your direction
 They come right up to you
 Well thats all it can do It dashed It
lurches towards them They move a little bit
quicker than youd expect but not necessarily
that quick They both spend their full turns
trying to close the gap For the horses
 Thats going to go ahead and end their go
Beau youre up
 You watch them as you peek under the tent
and they both just ran to the right
 Thats as close as you can get right there
You can go into a dash if you wanted to engage
directly
 Actually this is my fault I rolled for the
zombies to see who they saw first but technically
their turn hadnt come up yet Thats my fault
because their initiative is lower in the order so
were going to retcon a little bit of that Thats
still there
 Because your initiative was super high
Thats totally my bad Its early enough in the
combat where its not going to make a huge
difference But you do watch as they turn and they
look past the direction like theyre ready to dart
towards the actual large carnival tent
 You can at this point yeah Its two
squares to get there
 Its not a huge blaze but theres some
flames in it Its starting to burn out a little
bit
 Sure Id say go ahead and make an athletics
check
 Make an athletics check
 Rolled a natural  on his end
 As you swing with the staff it slams into
the side of the guards leg and you hear the
slight crack of wood as the armored exterior of
the zombified form seems to stand resolute against
the strength of your blow Its head which was
turned off angrily towards the shadowed direction
of Caleb and Fjord turns back the red burning
coals for eyes now glaring in your direction What
are you doing
 Well you did your one attack to sweep him
Its an unarmed attack for your next two
 Right Misunderstood Okay go for it Roll
for the attack
 You got it
  hits
 You guys with the ones at the start of this
fight
 Roll damage for the first one
 I know apparently
 Eight points of damage As you elbow across
wham You watch as the jaw hangs and dislodges a
bit and as its head turns towards you you reach
with your other first and it catches it in the
middle of the air and it tries to bite at your
arm but the jaw hangs open not able to actually
find any purchase in your arm I believe that ends
your turn Caleb youre up
 Right there Okay So go ahead and roll your
attack on that
  definitely hits
 Nine points of cold damage to it You watch
as its trying to bite with no effect towards
Beaus arm as shes pulling away The sphere slams
into the side of its shoulder it would be this
side and it pulls back You watch as the arm
breaks a bit and the ice shards coalesce around
the outside of the armor and linger with this
frost and mist that sprays off the impact It
looks fairly damaged
 Technically by the rules yes But it might
be easier to have you guys go at the same time
 Sure for now
 This one here
 Easy enough Frumpkin is underneath there
 That your turn
 Molly youre up
  You can indeed
 Go for it You see half of its body encased
in ice now and its still lashing out in Beaus
direction as you rush up
 Okay then
 Those both hit
 Yeah
 Which ones which
 The first attack is that die so thats not
the critical
 Well just double the die its fine Its
fun to do it that way Less dice to have to roll
  points of damage
 Ha nope So you watch as its slashing at
Beau The ice explodes in its side and Mollymauk
comes walking out of the tent both of the
scimitars spinning in his hand like this dervish
entity As he slams both blades simultaneously
into the sides of this creature he cuts a v shape
into the upper torso and it slips out of it The
central portion of its body slips onto the ground
with a splat and the arms fall to the side and the
body collapses onto the ground
 Which is now its turn Having you rush out
of the tent its attention once in the distance
it traces you over as you attack its ally It
lunges over towards you and makes two strikes in
your direction
 The bulging red eyes suddenly go black and
thick droplets of bloodlike ichor begin to spill
out the corners of the zombies eyes
 Oh are you
 You take three damage This attack and the
next attack he has disadvantage on
  and an eight for the first attack so that
bring it down to a  to hit
 As it rushes towards you you can see the
opening as it swings too wide and you duck right
out of the way Second attack with disadvantage as
well Thats a  and a  so the  plus four
thats  so it still hits
 The first one you duck out of the way
However the secondary slam hits you for five
points of bludgeoning damage across your shoulder
You get pushed back into Beau and Beau catches
your fall
 That ends its go Nott youre up
 Yeah
 She cant unfortunately
 No its  You can get to right
there
 That hits

 There you go
 Correct as it is adjacent to Molly
 Okay
 Thats a full ten points of damage to him
 You cant hide behind it because youd have
to get behind it but you can use your bonus
action to dash and get behind it Youre not
technically hiding but youll move in this direction
 Yep You get behind Oh god That finishes
your turn Nott That brings us to Jester Youre up
 And look out
 You see this sudden interaction of everyone
or at least Beau and Molly leaping towards the
standing zombie
 All right so Sacred Flame is a saving throw
for the
 It actually rolled exactly a  with no
modifiers so it does succeed
 Well what does it say on the spell is it
half damage or no damage
 Okay then yeah sorry
 Let me double check that
 That finishes Jesters turn Fjord youre
up
 Thats about as close as you can get right
there
 As you hold your arm out in force the edge
of the pommel glows with this dark black purple
crackling energy and this single bolt of Eldritch
energy fires out in the direction Roll for the attack
 That hits roll damage
 Nine points of damage nice It hits and the
armor dents inward to the point where if it was
still a living human it probably wouldve caused
some serious internal bleeding or bludgeoning but
the creature seems relatively unphased by the
impact other than being pushed onto one foot then
back on its twofoot weight That ends your
turn
 Beau youre up
 All right you have to move over to him
though
 You vault off of the corpse of the other
zombie guard and then leap down with your staff
towards him go for it
  still hits
  points of damage Wham You slam into it
and watch as it  Its starting to look
pretty beat up but its still standing
 You have a bonus action if you still want
it
 Every turn as long as youre attacking with
your action you can bonus attack with you unarmed
strike Then use a ki point to double attack if
you want
 Go for it roll for the attack
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points
 Thats okay Six points of damage Whack
You slam it in the side of the head with a
roundhouse kick and watch as the neck snaps and
the head is stick there like  Its
trying to snarl but you can hear the windpipe is
closed off at the angle that it got snapped and
its making this horrible choking sound
 Caleb your turn
 Roll for the attack
 That hits go ahead and roll damage
 Four points of damage All right The bolt
slams into the side of its head where it was hit
by Beau and actually snaps it back into place
You watch its eyes lull for a second and it comes
back with renewed undead strength
 Renewed in the sense that for a second you
watched the light flicker out but it seems to push
through by the force of the enchantment that holds
it aloft
 Youve got ten feet
  Whats the movement on Frumpkin
 All right Thats your turn
 All right Molly youre up
 Two more shots
 Eight Misses
  does hit Go ahead and roll damage
 Nine points of damage
As the blade sinks into its shoulder and you
see it carves in and jams halfway through the
torso the armor stopping it part way before it
lodges in and it leans forward  Its
still standing and your blades stuck in the
abdomen
 All right that ends your turn Molly Its
going to take its first slam swipe at you Since
youre immediately in front of it Thats a
natural  Im rolling some good s tonight
 What other dice
Of course its the snitch
  points of bludgeoning damage
 It clocks you across the side of
the temple Youre vision goes blurring for a
second You spit across the ground Youre used to
the sight of your own blood but now its across
the grass and dirt at your foot You start to feel
yourself get a bit woozy Its going to go ahead
and spin around and strike you with its open claw
with the other arm
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 That is nine points of bludgeoning damage
 You guys watch as the first hit clocks Molly
hard The second one is this clawing uppercut He
goes backwards dropping one scimitar the other
one being left stuck in the body of the undead
guard As it now glances back towards Beau to
its right Thats the end of Mollys turn and the
zombies turn Nott youre up
 No he fell straight back
 If he rolled a one wed talk
 Fire resistance
 Nott what do you got You just watched
Molly go down
 Unconscious
 All right
 How do you want to do this

 It doesnt even matter the damage you deal
If the damage from a critical hit it doesnt get
its undead fortitude

 Molly as you watch it turn around towards
you suddenly it lurches as a crossbow bolt
shatters its kneecap from behind Its other leg
which had been partially damaged from the process
of getting up and combat thats happened isnt
enough to keep it aloft It tumbles back into the
fire and immediately begins to burn as it begins
to scream and squeal See the flames begin to burn
and engulf its body before eventually it comes to
rest no longer held by this undead magic that
keeps it standing Quiet falls over the
encampment
 That being the case you become stable
 Youre not conscious yet but youre stable
You dont have to make
 Do you have a healers kit
 Beau as youre standing here Molly is no
longer bleeding out Hes breathing and coughing
in the unconsciousness from the pain You watch as
Jester is fiddling through her bag pulling things
out
 Ill say for the instance of this since
its not necessarily immediate danger of him dying
off Go ahead and make a medicine check
 Okay Ill say  Hes still
unconscious Given a little bit of time hell
come back to consciousness Ten minutes or so You
can probably eventually through the use of strong
vapors or something you can bring him back from
the brink At this point the rest of the carnival
currently within the vicinity begin to emerge from
the tents seeing that the danger has passed
 Make a perception check
 You glance around the interior of the
chamber which has a unique smell to the inside
You smelled it before but it catches you very
strongly now that theres quiet and youre not
focused on anything else A very faint smell of
brimstone lingers within the tent mingling with
the wet grass You look around and see no girl
 The one that he cleaved the armor is not
functional at all The other one the last one to
die the armor is still functional It is dented
and beat up but its still functional Theres
the slightly tarnished brass armor Then theres
the red maroon color Its like a scale mail
chestplate and armplates for it It could be used
but its still a big piece of armor Youd have to
lug it around or wear it
 You both do currently
 About yeah
 The Knot twins emerge like Where are the
guards the rest of them Are more coming or is
this all of them
 Do you think we should run
 As you continue to search through aside
from the armor that seems functional each of them
have a basic longsword
 Yes Which can be pulled out Between the
two of them you can gather about six gold pieces
and four silver pieces
 Glancing off to the side you can see the
lake is maybe  to  feet north
 Its pretty burned The maroon robes on the
one armor is damaged and can possibly be salvaged
The armor on the one that is burned can be used
The robes or the maroon cloth is burned away
entirely The armor looks like its been burned It
has blackened charcoal edges to it
 Okay If youre right there youre not far
from the tent You head back and see hes not on
the outside of the tent
 Make a religion check
 You believe the little girl may have tooted
before where she went to where she is
 You glance over and you dont see Caleb You
do see Fjord is in the process of looking in the
area You walk up and Caleb is nowhere near the
tent on the outside You dont know where he is
 An impressive display of physical strength
The little adorable tiefling without an issue
lifts the body out of the charred bits of burnt
wood and charcoal
 Ornna gives a hand and helps you The Knot
sisters look like they want to be absolved of this
whole scenario and look like theyre about to flee
at any moment
 As youre dragging Molly Molly your eyes
lull open and youre at one hit point Come to
consciousness
 Youre being dragged
 Okay Youre hooking them all up to
 As you guys are doing this the two Knot
sisters talking to each other look around and
they go running to the southeast
 Theyre out
 Sure
 No no it is
 Roll a perception check
 That is a mustang
 You guys have the bodies loaded up both the
charred and the slashed one onto the cart
 All right Easy enough to find any sort of
material if you wanted to cover the contents of
the cart You guys are ready to go Ornna is
standing there alone I think I should stay here
 What and be a fugitive I can explain what
happened Hopefully
 Exactly what happened The same thing that
turned these guards ran off and youre hoping to
stop it
 Okay I can do that I cant leave Gustav
and Bosun in prison to take the fall for this
 Im quite good with fire Thats not
entirely impossible
 No Never trusted anything that looked the
way Kylre did Everyone seemed to put a lot of
trust in him Gustav did Toya did I dont know
if this is still a misunderstanding but She
points over to where theres splatters of blood in
the middle of the grass The leftover carnage from
the battle Just get this figured out please
This is all I have left She looks around the
empty encampment She stands amongst the four
empty tents by herself
 Toyas gone
 Its okay Its hard for some folks to
trust carnival folk Just as hard as it is for
some folks to trust little green folk

 You hop on your mustang
 You have the cart and the horses at your
disposal What are you guys doing
 Okay The two of you saddle up on the back
of the cart as it makes its way northward
 All right The horses pick up and begin
heading northward towards the Ustaloch
 It doesnt take you too long to get to the
southern edge of the Ustaloch You can see the
muddy lake bed that gives way to the water itself
Number of scattered stones in the muck and
occasionally you hear the lapping of waves The
very subtle wind flowing through in the night
Its about two in the morning Theres some
moonlight in the sky It looks like a waxing moon
At least the one you can see because there are
multiple moons
 Theres two moons in Exandria
 That was established in the last campaign
 One of the moons is so faint
 Theres one Anyway theres a faint bit of
moonlight which gives you folks without darkvision
a little bit of detail that you can make out in
the vicinity You come to the lake edge and
theres the water
 Perception check
 Okay Couple things One
 you dont see any
guards but you do see a few hundred feet to the
west of you along the edge you see a boat that is
about a hundred feet out on the water You see two
figures that are in the boat Possibly two
fishermen or two guards but you cant really tell
from this distance There are two figures in a boat
a little ways out on the water
From your current visual
perspective you dont see the other end of the
lake Its a pretty decent sized lake but you can
see the very faint bump of a landmass that breaks
the horizon of the water
 Like an island possibly
 Yeah it breaks the waters horizon from
here
 Theres a faint bit of lantern light thats
the only reason youre able to make them out at
this distance but thats as much detail as you
can make out Theyre a few hundred feet away from
you
 Oh man
So what do you do
 That would be very confusing
 Make a survival check
 Even with your darkvision its hard to make
out too many details Theres a lot of foot
traffic along the banks of the river at different
points in the day Theres not a lot of light
Youre unable to pick up any tracks
 Okay so you remove the bodies from the
cart Are you dumping them on the shoreline
 Okay  The two transformed guard
corpses now lie there One an ashy mess the other
in three pieces Left along the bank of the
water
 Okay 
 Make a survival check
 All right You guys

 You glance back over and you can see the
boat seems to have moved a little bit further away
and has come up to the bank and looks like its
hitting land
 No a little bit further away and then has
hit the land The figures are currently taking
things out of the boat
 Okay which direction are you moving
 Well north is into the water Like you hit
the water of the bottom of the lake
 Thats the direction it was traveling
 Make a survival check sure
 Oh Sam
  Its hard to really make out what tracks
are what You do see a few heavy impacts in the
mud Some of them looks like it could have been
the bodies being rolled but not too far from
where you are theres one big smack in the mud
Like something heavy impacted
 Make an investigation check
 This will break your short rest
 You can see the heavy impact has a few
subtler imprints There do appear to be two hands
and two feet though the water has washed in and
gotten rid of a lot of the details at this point
You can vaguely tell they appear to be facing
towards the water
 Two people in the boat
 They look proportionate to each other
 They both look vaguely humanoid and
regular
 They are a little bit to the west along the
bank in the direction of the city The city is
northwest of you currently If you were to
continue around the lake
 Exactly
 I mean if you want to You havent yet
decided to
 Actually Id say for the points of
expediency with the time it has taken you and
have these discussion at the edge its pushing
finished the short rest
 You get your blood maledict and you can use
your hit dice if you want
 Yeah its gone
 Thats better there you go
 Better than one
 Make a survival check
 You have advantage on it because its a
feat
 Looking at the imprint you follow back the
direction of the carnival and you can see the path
because it was a beeline toward the Ustaloch The
best you can tell because the water picks up
theres no trail to pick up in the water Looking
at the trajectory it was very intently making its
way towards the water either avoiding making any
more tracks and making it difficult to follow
 Not near you Theres the one that you saw
the two fishermen are at right now Then further
into the city the docks theres plenty of boats
that are tied up and locked
 The other side of the lake from what you
know because you were traveling southward towards
it theres no major landmass on the other side of
the lake Its just open field You notice what
looks to be some sort of a bulge in the landmass
in the center Too large to be the toad but it
does seem to break up the water horizon from that
vantage point
 Its not like a mental tracking ability
Its to be able to see details of the specific
type of tracks
 Just like any other tracking you still need
to have things to follow You can read damage in
the forest to see if something barreled through
You can follow tracks You can see blood
splatters Any sort of thing that can give you an idea of
where something went that is of those types of creatures
 With the knowledge of it being a fiend go
ahead and make a religion check
 You do actually
  Now that theyve mentioned a fiend it seems
familiar but the most you can get is
a memory that you dont know where it
came from this memory of horrible toadlike
demonic creatures that exist to the far east in Xhorhas
Thats as much as you can recall But youre
definitely sitting here now with this memory
that comes to mind going This whole time This 
whole time
 Technically elements of that guards body
are charcoal now
 Okay so the cart makes its way 
The two fishermen you see are in the process
of tying up nets and bags of things and they just
stop and watch you guys ride by then go about the
rest of their work You continue with the cart
pulling it up toward the southern edge of where the
Ustaloch meets Trostenwald and you can abandon it
there or you said you wanted to send it somewhere
 So what are you doing
 I see Okay
 Okay so you guys head the opposite direction for a
little ways after the field All right Whos spooking the horses
 Make an animal handling check
 Whats your armor class
  As soon as you hit it theres a
 and theres a splitsecond where you watch
its back leg muscle twitch and you duck out of the
way just as its back hooves  past your face
 Yeah
 Make an animal handling check
 No You knew the animals but you werent
the animal handler
 Okay Ill give you an animal handling check
with advantage because its fun
  Its above a ten guys Awesome
 Yeah I know With a crack and a heavy
echoing snarling sound in the vicinity both
horses kick up and go into a full gallop sprint
away from the direction of you the cart being
dragged behind it They continue to go into the
shadow You dont know how long theyre going to go
 By the time you guys make it back to the
inn
 Are you guys being careful or are you just
walking back
 Id like you all to roll a stealth check
please
 All right thats fine You manage to make
it to the Nestled Nook Inn without any prying eyes
seeing too deeply into your movement You get back
to your rooms as the very faint distant change of
black night begins to turn to the faintest of blue
of morning curling over You guys go to your
respective rooms and you take a rest
 Okay The owner watches you do that and
shes just Whatever
 Dont get anything else dirty
 You guys complete a long rest
 Your max hit points I mean your max hit
points are your max hit points
 With full rests completed consciousness
comes to on the outside of Jesters room with the
heavy sound of 
 You open the door The same two crownsguard
that had come the day before
 No We came to tell you that youll be
needed for the investigation and questioning
within the next three hours to arrive at the
behest of the Lawmaster at the stockade
 Well be back in three hours
  Habit of creeping out guards
I like this The rest of you come to consciousness
Youre rested At this point in time its
past noon Its about two in the afternoon
 Well no Its these two currently 
for the moment Then 
 Just finishing up with them
 Yes
 Two guards are there
 Sorry to disturb the investigation will
require you in about three hours
 All right so What are you guys doing
 Correct
 Shes right in the middle of pouring a drink 
shes like Right What do you need
 If youre looking for strange wares in
general then your best look would be Burnished Bibelots
 You might be able to talk to lets see
here Lochward General might be interested in
buying a few things
 Lochward General
 Aye its about three blocks up north
 It looks very pretty Make an intelligence
check
 Yes just your modifier
 Its very shiny
 Yes
 All right you guys make your way to Burnished
Bibelots It is open though there is nobody
currently inside the interior As you go to the
door it opens up and you see the same cluttered
mess of the inside There across the way you see
the tiny gnome gentleman whos up on top of his
desk his legs folded over each other Hes
looking through a book right now as hes thumbing
through Hello
 Yes Okay Good I have them held right here
He reaches back and then has to arrange himself again
 Eventually he crawls off the top of the
desk gets down there puts the two books on the
top Wonderful doing business with you Slides
them forward to you counts
 Those are the ones you told me to hold for
you yes
 Yes they are
 You guys make your way back as the rest of
you have come to consciousness and you head
down to the tavern
 So itll take you a few hours to go through
those books
 You begin to read through it In the tavern
at the table or do you want to read in your room
Up to you
 Its an interesting book It talks about
different forms of fiends and demons and the
hierarchy of the Nine Hells It talks about myths
and stories of devils and demons interfering with
the lives of mortals A lot of it is fables a lot
of it is warnings and things that parents would
tell to keep their children from wandering in the
darkness But it does have little tidbits of
information about different types and they talk
about horned devils and they talk about the great
and terrible balor and pit fiend and it seems to
be a jumble between both demons and devils
 Sure if he lets you
 Right now its about three
 Yes
 You do find one interesting tidbit of
information that piques your interest
 If he decides he wants to share its up to
him
 As Fjord slowly walks away from the table
not engaging with your comedic advances
 No you didnt inquire or question
 Oh no its a general book about
 Anywhere anything it doesnt even mention
locations Its just This is some lore about
devils and demons
 As soon as he says that it triggers
something in your brain and that thought you had
the other night clicks Like thats what it was
that was escaping you Nergaliid
 He ate what was given to him
 He seemed like a lizard man from what you
knew and experienced He thought it was fine
There was no draw to it
 Make a religion check
 Sure Ill let you roll for it
 You dont get the idea that most devils or
demons have a vulnerability to radiant or holy
damage Some might some dont but youre
unable to take a bead on this The book you have
is informative from an encyclopedia standpoint
Its sort of storytelling and an informative
thing but its not a catalog about all the
aspects and details of each creature
 Yeah you were like wait
 In comparison to some maybe Youre not
Johnny Fivestyle I know kungfu
 Yeah you can read pretty quick lets say
You spend a lot of time by yourself reading
 From the window to the wall

 As you guys are having this discussion the
two guards that had come in earlier come through
the main door earlier than the three hours you had
anticipated with another guard in tow As they
rush in they glance around the room and see you
and make a beeline to your table in a very huffed
bit of energy They say You are absolved of
meeting this afternoon Well pick this up
tomorrow
 There have been a series of murders within
the Crownsguard that we are investigating as well
This will be part of the investigation tomorrow
you are not to leave this inn
 You are absolved of it today Were still
going to come by tomorrow and have you questioned
Weve arrested Ornna and we have members of the
carnival that have fled that were currently
seeking at the moment
 Well return tomorrow They leave in a
frustrated huff
 Youve got about eight silvers worth of
incense and thats a lot
 Its masking the faint scent of horse dung
 Yorda is currently in the process of sitting
down and checking something underneath the bar and
goes Im sorry what was that
 How much is the
 No youre going to need to go out and buy
some
 There is the remedy store that youve seen
before and that would be the place to have
incense andor herbal type
 All right so you have ten gold between you

nine from Fjord and one from Molly
 Okay so eight off All right you have the
gold Well say for the purposes of expediency
its easy enough to go and purchase the necessary
incense and its quite a bit For the purposes of
this ritual which youve done before its quite
a cluster you have to assemble for this The
chalks amassed the other materials you need for
it
 I dont know you guys have made me facepalm
pretty long before
 What form
 As you finish the concentration the cat
form shimmers and condenses into this tiny little
cluster of coal before it sprouts wings and you
glance on your shoulder 
 You guys after waiting patiently and
talking amongst yourselves Caleb reemerges with a
tiny sparrow
 You can only see through Frumpkins eyes for
up to a foot radius
 Let me doublecheck
 I have to recall the specifics I may have
confused
 The wording is a little squirrely Yeah you
cannot communicate with it telepathically but you
could technically still see through its eyes I
suppose
 Right Whats the command
 All right As you go up to the window and
release Frumpkin
 Its curious when Caleb is focusing the
pupils go to a very faint sky blue You see
flickering in them though you cannot make any
imagery out of it its just the strange movement
within the pupil
 As you concentrate the birdseye view of
Trostenwald Frumpkin carries up high into the
air For the large lake that it is you can see
two smaller land masses in the center of the lake
Technically not north from where you are now
since youre back in the city its more of a
northeastern direction Theyre both relatively
small ones maybe a few hundred feet across
another one is maybe  feet across Its a
smaller mass Watching as it coasts downward and
does a pass over the larger one make a perception
check for Frumpkin
 There is a faint treeline on this island
The island has a few small trees which is mainly
what you had seen during the night when you looked
out over the water Beauregard The land mass was
actually the very top of this tree line Its a
small grove that has clustered there on the center
of this island Unable to make out any other
details other than the tops of these trees and
theres a few spots in between where you can see
overgrown grass and general ground rock
 The bigger one yeah Make a perception
check for the smaller one
 The other one has maybe five or six trees on
it but most of them appear to have either died or
be standing alone on this small mass That one
looks pretty barren Even with as bad of a look as
that was it doesnt look like theres anything
visible on that land mass
 It does
 The larger one has much more of a cluster a
grove
 Yeah theyre roughly  feet apart from
each other
 Yes basically
 Sure what would you like to make
 Okay It requires half a day to make that
 Okay
 Okay
 Thats easy enough
 Okay
 Make an intelligence check adding your
proficiency modifier
 For the supplies that youve spent Youve
used your one set of acid supplies you had on you
so youll have to buy more to make it again As
you begin to make it it becomes caustic and
begins to melt through part of your glove You
immediately freak out you drop it and it hits
the wood Splatters a bit and begins to melt
through the wood
 It is still slowly eating through the wood
 Eventually Frumpkin begins to return having
done Frumpkins full watch
 You come out of it and the first thing you
see is all of them gathered around this hole in
the wood
 As you concentrate the area and the wood
around where that hole is all of a sudden begins to
turn darker and more solid While the texture
remains of wood suddenly it has the appearance of
a dull reddishbrown metal
 There are some fishing vessels out there
and there are a number of them that are still at
the docks
 No
 By now its 
 in the afternoon four
oclock
 Actually its probably closer to five at
the time that youve spent with Frumpkin so its
starting to get closer to dusk
 From where you are right now Id say a mile
and a half
 As long as you can remember yeah
 Sure Easy enough The sun is close to
setting youve got about another  minutes
or so before it sets
 Okay well say for that thatll run you
about Fine liquor About two silver pieces
 Its a hefty flask too
 Mark that bar tally All right Liquor
refilled you go towards the window you all
gather and glance out and in the alley below the
inn is a stationed crownsguard that wasnt there
before You immediately get the sense that with
the sudden murder of two crownsguard being
discovered in the vicinity they may have beefed
up security a little bit
 Only one of them is guarding the alleys
exit onto the main street and theyre looking
away at the moment out into the road but occasionally
glance over their shoulder into the alley But
there appears to be a little more of a security
setup
 Okay you exit without issue
 Easy enough and as you exit the tavern you
can see where once there were two guards sitting
at the front theres now three and there are two
guards stationed across the street that are
keeping a watch It looks like everyones on high
alert since theyve had some of their own
crownsguard killed You make your way around the
corner through the Tintersection to the other
road that meets with the main street that crosses
in front of the Nestled Nook and you see the
guard stationed outside whos currently leaning up
against the wall arms crossed looking back and forth
 Make a deception check
  He goes Which way Please point and
show me
 He grabs his blade and draws it out and
gives a jog after you The rest of you guys make
your way down quickly outside into the alleyway
Make a stealth check
 All right
 All right Between the three of you making
the check thats still a majority success But you
do pop your ankle when you land
 I was being kind You sprained your ankle a
little bit as you land and you kind of hop behind
but the three of you make your way past the alley
without issue
 No

 The three of you dart on the outside and
make your way down the alley behind what looks to
be a cluster of empty rain barrels that are set up
to catch during storms and you appear to have
managed to just avoid the sight of the guarding
crownsguard on the outside of the inn Caleb and
Nott what are you guys doing
 So they darted off into the alley what are
you guys doing
 While he was distracting them you saw the
guard leave with Fjord
 You arent there You havent caught up with
them yet theyre still out in the open
 So the two of you make your way towards the
docks slowly
 Right I see everything
 You guide for two and a half blocks and the
guards still like Where is it
 You called me You said there was one of
them
 He sheathes the blade
 He walks up and slaps you across the top of
the head and just goes Dont go wasting our time
 He spits on the ground towards you and turns
around and heads back to his post
 You all manage to slowly make your way to
the outskirts of the Ustaloch down to where the
majority of the docks are set up on the lake
itself Since the lights have gone out most of
the boats have now come back in and they are
bringing in their hauls out and have small nets
and baskets filled with fish theyve caught while
theyre out there small crustaceans most of them
are in the process of just offloading and locking
up and tying their boats What are you guys doing
 You are actually
 One of the larger fishing
vessels that can carry a group of your size as
well as a couple of others has already been
pulled in and most everyone has been loaded off
You can see theres one gentleman in his
midforties a little bit of a five oclock shadow
on his chin a small scar across the bottom of it
He has a heavy knitted cap thats folded back onto
the top of his shoulders and a long coat and as
hes standing there he looks over at you and
watches you approach taking the rope and tying it
around the edge
 If youre looking for someone to take you
around the lake I could do that for a bit of coin sure
 He glances at your hands as youre talking
You look like a hardworker
 Where are you from
 I see youve been a shiphand before I can
see the cracks in the fingers
 He looks at his own hand So youre just
looking for a joyride
 Ill tell you what Ill take you around
You get a bottle to take more out there well
call it even
 All right He goes and starts getting the
boat ready to go back out on the lake
 Hes getting ready The trade was to bring a
bottle
 A bottle of fine wine runs you about ten
gold pieces A bottle of basic wine about a gold
This is some TwoBuck Chuck style of wine
 You spend the gold and you get a bottle of
cheap wine make your way back to the boat
 Yeah
 As you return with the bottle you all get
onto the boat The older gentleman as you all get
vessel Ill take you where you need to go Now
if I can ask where youre headed Want to do a
pass on the lake and back or
 As he pulls the rest of the rope in as you
guys are on board he stops Beautiful
 He goes and gets his paddle out and begins
making his way Well theres only two islands
out there Ones a piece of shite and the others
Crookedstone
 Crookedstone used to be where and old witch
lived about a hundred years ago

 No one goes over to Crookedstone
 Well it doesnt really have a name Its
too small
 Can I ask you where youre going
 He puts the oar down
   
 Fair be it to me to judge To Crookedstone
then He picks up his oar and begins paddling
 I dont know Probably died many years ago
and no one goes around seeing as its cursed
land Youll see for yourself soon enough
 Probably
 We dont really deal with witch folk
 Id only expect as such
  Takes another swig as you guys
begin to make your way towards the center of the
Ustaloch
 Sure Both of you make a perception check
please
 Sure
 Okay
 Okay For future note if everyones going
to make a perception check I may have a few folks
you know to helm it and other people aiding
their roll with advantage Just so we dont end up
having a barrage of perception like They failed
I do it They failed I do it Because that
gets a little lame All right as you guys keep
watch over the edge of the water heading in as
the sky darkens heading towards Crookedstone the
island in the center of the Ustaloch Prepare
yourselves for whatever youll find there and
were going to go to break
 Its time Were going to go ahead and take
a quick ten minute break roughly We have ten
minutes so we get a little bathroom break Well
be back here shortly Make sure to stick around
for a video at the break in which we have our
Wyrmwood contest to win some awesome Wyrmwood
stuff so keep an eye Well be back here in a
little bit See you soon

 Welcome back Sam
 Oh Im going to get you guys back one of
these days real hard
 Welcome back
 Our winner of the grandiose collection of
Wyrmwood elements is koehlerart Congratulations
youre the winner Danoba will contact you and get
your information Pretty nice win on your part
Well have next week another giveaway to look
forward to that
 You swooed Dont do that
 The sun has set as you guys approach the
outer banks of the Crookedstone Island in the
center of the Ustaloch You can see the grove a
clustered central conglomerate of trees that all
create this mound of brush Now that youre up
close against it you can see the bit of moonlight
thats starting to come over the horizon dancing
across the upper part of the canopy The trees at
most are about  to ten feet tall Theyre not
incredibly huge some even hovering around the
five to ten foot range on the outskirts
 He was about eight feet tall hunched
forward
 As you approach the bank you can see
already theres a lot of heavy rocks This is not
a soft muddy embankment like the outskirts of the
lake This has a lot of jagged rock and your
shipfinding friend is carefully making his way
through as close as he can before he comes to a
stop pushes off with an oar and says All
right I think this is as close as I can get What
are you doing here if I might ask
 Make a deception check
 Sorry I asked
 Ill tell you what
 I get the sense the less I know the better
off I am Go about your business Ill be waiting
here Dont do anything stupid Im not getting
involved with anything If theres some illegal
business here and I see something shifty Im back
on the shore and you have to swim your way home
 He takes the bottle and takes a big heavy
swig and sits down in the boat
 All right As you guys step off the boat
into about ankledeep water traversing the broken
bits of sharpened stone making your way to the
actual island of Crookedstone you begin to slowly
approach the outside of the treeline What do you
guys want to do
 Make an investigation check
 What are you doing Are you looking around
for details
 Make a survival check with advantage
 Its hard to tell Because its such a rocky
shore there arent a lot of signs of landfall
 Moonlight and a little bit of a dissipating
orangepurple glow in the sky
 Oh no
 Whats the plan guys
 Perception check on Frumpkin please
 With disadvantage because of the lack of
light
 Yeah the lack of detail nothing really
catches Frumpkins eye from above
 Make a perception check
 Are you glancing about or are you going to
wade through the forest to look for things
 Make an investigation check
 Which is good because the first roll should
have stayed anyway Works out well
 Seven Its hard to tell in the dark
unfortunately Your human eyes prevent you from
finding any details in the vicinity without a
light source The faint bit of moonlight gives you
the general structure of the island but beyond
that even looking close you have a hard time
making out details
 Okay What is the order in which you guys
are walking or fanning out
 Technically youre in the Well go with
this
 You guys all carefully make your way into
the treeline The smell here is definitely that of
low tide You get that unearthing of sediment and
the occasional whiff of dead fish
 No not at the moment You guys push further
in Are you being quiet about this
 Then I would like you all to make a stealth
check
 As you guys slowly become a cohesive unit a
true adventuring party you begin to carefully
make your way through Thankfully most of the
small tree cluster this small glade the floor of
it is soft and as you step theres no heavy
snapping of twigs or crumbling of leaves
Something does catch the edge of your foot on the
outskirts Fjord as you glance down You see what
that have been fished out of the nearby lake and
have been completely eaten The inside has been
cleared out
 Something about being deflowered
 You guys continue about  or so feet into
the treeline before you start finding I wouldnt
say a clearing but the trees arent as closely
placed together There is some semblance of an
opening here and there
 Unfortunately youre having a hard time to
make out any sign You guys make your way towards
the center of this cluster of trees
 Okay Make a perception check Well one of
you do the other can aid if you want to and that
gives you advantage on the roll
 Yeah
 You dont see any more crab shells but you
do glance a bit ahead and amongst the trees you
can see stonework Stones stacked in a wall that
is toppled over and fallen A small ruin Some
sort of a structure once a singlestory structure
that seems to have fallen inward and been
destroyed Partially overgrown and what little
moonlight comes through you can make out the
shape of it Theres corners still standing but
other than that it looks like its been toppled
over and left to ruin
 If you get a little closer you can yeah
 Okay You creep up and you can see its a
ruined building It looks like it was  feet on
one side  feet on the other Its destroyed
 Theres no hut Its a ruin
 Like The Secret Youre manifesting a witch
fight here Wheres the hut
 You guys approach Whos keeping visual
point on this
 Whos helming this Ill give one of you a
perception roll to help on this
 Technically I should have given Beau
disadvantage because of her human eyes I let it
slide because you were looking for crustaceans
 Im not used to you being a human
 I know It worked out fine for the
narrative
 No
 Its too dark to see anything even with
your darkvision It looks like a ruin It could
very well be that this island is abandoned
 It looks like whatever roof was has fallen
in and all there are are some semblances of the
wall still standing and corners to the structure
but most of it is either crumbled in entirely
 Yep
 Okay You climb up onto there is no roof
to it per se Its all fallen in
 You want me to put a witch in this You want
me to throw a witch in this There can be a witch Sam
 I got rules for this shit in the book
 Yeah going back to my first campaign Roll
for number of witches As you vault up to the top
edge of one of the stronger walls you head up
onto the side and glance to the back right as a
pair of red eyes  right up at you and
this 
 I need you to roll initiative
 Nope
 All of you
 Theres Beau right there
 Whereabouts are you guys currently
 Fjords right there giving you the boost
up You and Molly were close to it
 You guys are next to each other because
youre holding there Molly moved up to probably
here Around there
 Okay
 Lets go ahead and oh shit okay
  to  anybody Nott since you got
high You got higher than that last time  to 
 Hold on We have Molly up front at  Whos
next after that
 For the ease of this were going to run
with Frumpkin on your initiative order because
otherwise its another initiative we have to worry
about
 Yeah All right so Caleb  to ten
 All right Nott What did you get Fjord
 Top of the combat round Molly you hear
this growl and you watch Beau begin to react and
get the staff ready and you immediately know this
is not good but youre up first
 You can only apply one per round on a bonus
action
 Oh youre doing both right now
 Technically its a bonus action you cant
convert an action to a bonus action
 No Unfortunately
 Yeah you could apply it once and then you
still have your action if you want to
 You can mark down you take down your
temporary hit points or your max hit points to 
 Okay You move there
 It is now Kylres turn
 All right seeing you right there the devil
toad turns to little Toya to the side who looks a
bit dirtied at a glance and goes Theyre trying
to take you away Come sing for us Stop them
 All right The devil toad is going to
straight leap which would pass through your you
get an attack of opportunity and land right
there
 Make your attack if you want to
 Its just a hit with your staff yeah
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Correct
 Seven points of damage You smack it on the
way with this horrible wet thud to the back of its
body but it moves through with immense speed
especially with the density and the weight of this
thing as it lands the ground shakes in the area
the vicinity and as it lands it uses its action
to Summon Devil
 As it lands it begins to mutter a language
under its breath Anybody here speak Infernal
 You hear an incantation that essentially
amounts to a faint Come protect me brothers
beneath its breath and three bursts of flame
 As three imps apparate in the vicinity
 Here and here Roll their initiative Okay
 Thats his action and Toyas up next Toya
actually rolled initiative just below
 Toya is looking around looking scared
looking at you motioning towards her 
Her haunting voice begins to spread from her and I
need all of you to make a wisdom saving throw please
 Okay Thats some good saving throws guys
your eyes move towards her and theres an
enchantment that pulls your attention You have
disadvantage on any attack rolls you make for the
next turn She scared sees you and begins to
walk back this way and hide behind the wall but
continues to sing giving this aura in the
vicinity That ends Toyas turn Beau youre up
as well as Jester
 So thats your action Where are you placing
your
 Let me see real fast Still getting used to
these new abilities
 It appears anywhere within  feet of you in
an unoccupied space
 You can go around this one there
 That gives you some cover Thats your turn
Beau youre up
 All right make an acrobatics check
 Yeah You make the landing roll and go
towards her Youre going to use your action to grapple
 Go ahead and make an athletics check
please
 As you land you manage to grapple Toya and
using the staff you press her against the wall
and the scared dwarf girls eyes are open wide
The singing falters for a second but she
continues to still sing and you see her eyes
looking around desperately for
 I mean you have a bonus action yes
 Technically a grapple is an attack so its
an attack action so yeah You can
 Just a straight attack If youre just
hitting or pushing ahead with it Ill say
  Does not hit actually
 Its more that fact that as youre pressing
in shes adjusting her body and shes reaching
up grabbing and trying to keep her voice
emitting from her throat You cant seem to get a
beat to press She looks genuinely really scared
and freaking out at being put in this position
 Okay That ends Beaus turn Caleb youre
up
 Yeah theres no light in here
 Most any roll youd be making would be at
disadvantage
 Actually we have a light for this Forgot
about that I shouldve put that on Hints of
moonlight
 Well say within this vicinity here the
entire center of the island now glows You can see
the ruins casting shadows off against the rocks in
the vicinity from where each globe is placed You
all have a pretty good view of the battlefield at
the moment
 You can get right behind Fjord if you want
to That ends Calebs turn Nott youre up
 One way to find out
 Okay go for it
 Eight
 As you swing wide it flaps its wings
backward and the tiny demonic humanoid creature
with its wings in the air goes 
 Okay theres that
 Okay so youre all clustered up here behind
the ruins
 All right so that finishes your turn Nott
Fjord youre up
 You can With the light thats burning up
there it only goes about maybe five or six feet
there You have a good view of the creature
 That you can
 As you focus on it and you condense your
attention you guys watch as the blade in Fjords
hand shimmers slightly What was previously a
faint bit of polished metallic suddenly begins to
grow something organic looking A cluster of
barnacles begin to appear out of the hilt of the
weapon and curl down about three or four inches
down the blade and it begins to drip water
sourceless Like it was freshly pulled out of the
ocean The shadows that had been drawn from the
nearby bits of stonework begin to tear into the
body of the devil toad who looks around at the
ground as theres now this squirrely swirling bit
of black energy thats wrapping around and causing
it to look about confused at its torso Thats
your bonus action
 All right
 Youre shooting Toya Or are you shooting
the toad
 For the Hexblades Curse well have to
double check
 It is for your melee I dont think its for
spells unfortunately
 Yeah that hits Go ahead and roll damage
  Slick
 Because its plus
 The hexblade is that also for a melee
weapon though
 Great yeah Thats  With that as you
snipe through the pommel of your blade the energy
blast strikes and the toad as it impacts the
shadows seem to grab the bolts of energy and tear
them back towards its torso causing additional
damage as it 
 Okay Thats the end of your turn Top of
the round Now the imps go
 Yep
 Two three four
 Oh no its a  foot fly speed

 All right cool
 With that all three are of
them are going to make a sting strike Thats one
against you Caleb Thats a natural three plus
five Thats eight
 Misses you Against Nott that Jesus
Nine
 Then Molly A  plus five
 You would have You take your strike as it
comes into range
  does hit Just hits
 Nine points of damage As it swings down
with its wings you arc out with your scimitar and
you carve through its body It looks horribly
hurt blood spatters across your arm and across
your forearm from the creature
But it still survives and jams its stinger
into you You suffer from that
Its cocked That is five points of
piercing damage and you have to make a
constitution saving throw please
 Correct
  is just what you need to succeed You
only suffer four points of poison damage
 Nine points of damage total
 Correct
 Oh wait Okay good to know
 Thank you for clarifying Go ahead and roll
another die
 You rolled a ten
 Well its the additional die
 So  damage on that one nice Good to know
thank you That brings us to the end of the imps
turn Molly youre up
 Well no You have to attack with one hand
and then as a bonus you can attack with the
other
 You can attack with the one thats not
enchanted if you wanted to
 Okay
 Go for it
 That hits go ahead and roll damage
 With a scream and a burst of flame and
sulfurous cloud the imp flickers out of
existence
 Okay you used your action you still have
your bonus action
 You can still attack with your bonus action
if you wanted to Okay then back away Thats
your turn then Mollys done Kylre lets see
here Hes going to make a standing leap
 Lands right next to you Caleb you get
knocked almost off your feet and barely hold
yourself there As it lands you glance over your
shoulder at it its eyes burn ever bright and you
feel this horrible sickening sensation crawl
across your body make a wisdom saving throw
 That succeeds the saving throw
 You are not stunned as the siphon life
deals four points of psychic damage to you
 Yes The life that it pulls from you
bolsters himself and it wouldve been a lot worse
if you had failed so thats good All right
thats going to end Kylres turn Now going to
Toya whos still singing I need everybody to
make a wisdom saving throw please
 Yes You guys are rolling some crazy fucking
saving throws
 Jesus Well Toya keeps singing Shes
starting to cry now you can see tears running
down her face as youre pushing her into the wall
That ends Toyas turn Beau and Jester youre up
 You dont know
 All right
 Okay go ahead and roll for the attack
Guiding Bolt is a ranged spell attack correct
 Seven is not a hit As you attempt to fire
the bolt outward the devil creature glances up
and sees your secondary form and then ducks as it
blasts into the ground right by your feet arcing
past and exploding across the dirt and bits of
whatever it is there The word escaped me in the
moment
 Yes Well no I was going to say compost
There you go compost was the word I was looking
for
 Okay As you come out of the way the toads
longarmed reach swipes out at you as a reaction
 As you run and dart you see the giant arm
coming down towards you and you pull the shield
up and it almost causes you to trip from the sheer
force of the impact But the brunt of it is taken
by the shield as it scrapes off and you hear this
horrible grinding of metal as its claws scoop
across the outside of it That ends your turn I
believe Beau
 Are you trying to cover her mouth
 Okay Go ahead and make an additional
athletics check
 All right Make an athletics check
 She rolled a ten as well That is
considered
 No I believe for contesting
 Right Im looking at contesting grapple
checks here real fast
 Doesnt say as part of the rules Ill say
for the hell of it lets roll it one more time
 Yes
 Natural  This tiny little dwarf girl her
stout form still manages to pull your arm back
from her mouth The voice continues to
billow outward
 Yeah it was an attack yeah It was a
grapple attack You do
 I mean what you want to do
 Okay make an attack
 That hits roll damage
 Eight damage Whack As you smack her in the
side of the head her eyes loll back and she falls
limp in your grasp Shes unconscious
 The singing immediately stops
 You have your movement You are holding her
there
 Okay its half movement to drag her Thats
as far as you can get
 As soon as the singing stops  The
toad looks over the shoulder and sees you dragging
her back What previously was this low guttural
growl becomes this bellowing scream of hatred
That ends your turn Beau
 Caleb your turn
 All right You are in melee range with a
creature doing a ranged spell attack so go ahead
and roll your attack It has disadvantage
 Unfortunately as youre scared the sound
of its screaming causes you to shake as you
release the blast Unfortunately your fingers
lose the hold of your diamond for a moment and you
have to actually catch it As you do the spell
dissipates and fumbles Anything else on your
turn Caleb
 That ends Calebs turn Nott youre up
 Which one the toad
 You will get an attack
 Im sorry
 Exactly As you push away from the imp as it
tries to strike at you seeing your friend in
serious danger here you dive into the shadows
leap into the air Go ahead and roll an attack
  hits Go ahead and roll damage plus sneak
attack because Caleb is in range
 All right So  points of damage As you
drive the blade into the devil toad you see it
plunge right to the hilt and it begins to bleed
from the wound but its attention is still focused
on the unconscious dwarf being dragged off by the
monk But that was a pretty sizeable blow That
ends your turn I believe Fjord
 Does it say its concentration
 Then I would say its not concentration
 Yes you may
 That you can As you run through the space
between that large rock and the exterior of the
ruined building your large blade water drifts
off of it behind It seems to almost perpetually
emanate its own source of water You arc with the
blade forward Go ahead and make your strike
 That hits
 Is it onehanded or are you holding it with
two hands
 You did not
 Was it plus four right
 Your charismas plus four Then you get a
plus two because of your Hex so technically its
 Sorry 
 That is going to be a  Whats the DC
 As you rush through the air and the blade
arcs the water seems to glow as it comes off
like it becomes phosphorescent and as he impacts
the blade into the side of the demon toad theres
a flash of light and whats left behind is the
scar that youve cut through its body is now
burning with this reminiscent ember where you just
carved through its hide It looks down at you
averts its gaze from the monk for a second and
goes  For a split second for
the first time you see fear in its red burning
eyes
 How long does that last
 Again Okay So he has disadvantage on
attacks and cannot move closer towards you
 That ends Fjords turn The imps are up now
This imp here is going to turn around and dart
towards the cleric who ran off to the side and
that ones going to attack Caleb Caleb that is
going to be a  to hit
 That hits
 Okay So you suffer as the stinger hits
you for seven points of piercing damage I need
you to make a constitution saving throw please
 A  succeeds So you only suffer five
points of poison damage
 The other imp attacking you Jester That is
going to be a natural  Pretty sure that hits
you at  You take six points of piercing damage
and I need you to make a constitution saving throw
 Actually thats not too bad Six points of
poison damage
 Correct
 All right thats going to end the imps
turn Molly youre up
 Thats  feet there
 Variant tiefling
 A wisdom saving throw
 That is going to be a no with a seven Im
pretty sure
 All righty good to know
 Vicious Mockery is an action
 Okay That ends your turn It is now Kylres
turn who is  oh man yeah He was about
to go right after Beau but hes scared of you and
cannot move closer towards you Hes going to take
a swing at Nott Hes like 
and try to squash the small thing right there
with disadvantage That is 
 s your armor class That hits  points
of piercing damage as the claw strikes out at you
and I need you to make a constitution saving
throw
 Ten is just what you needed to succeed The
poison from the claws of the toad does not set
into your system
 Kylres going to out of sheer panic now
from you try to flee So hes going to leap and
land over here You do both get attacks of
opportunity on the toad Would not have fled
except for that fear effect Hes like Fuck I
got to run
 That hits
 Hits
 Sure
 Eight points of damage You added sneak
attack to that right
 Because he is next to it
  points of damage Nice
 How does the effect on that work
 Yes it does
  points of damage All righty
 As an action it has to try and save against
the spell ending the effect Damn thats crazy
All righty so that being the case thats going
to end Kylres turn Lands looks over at you
hiding behind the tree
 Toya death saving throw Thats a success
All righty that brings us to Beau and Jester
What are you guys doing Beau and Jester
 Youre right here next to Toya
 Yeah
 Its half movement with her if you bring
her
 Okay Double move
 Thats right So you can get there
 You have your bonus action
 Kylre between the trees and being
frightened of Fjord doesnt seem to notice you at
the moment Hes currently focused on the fear
effect
 Thats all good That ends your turn
Jester
 Okay
 Well youre still in his combat range
actually He has a tenfoot range
 He does have disadvantage on the attacks
because of the fear effect so thats helpful Do
you want to run through this way
  that puts you there Both the imp and
Kylre get an
 The imp because
 Oh thats right yeah Thats right
 That Vicious Mockery brings the imps attack
down to a nine so the stinger whips past you
Kylres giant claw reaches out and tries to catch
you as you run past Natural  and a three

 That puts you at a nine which Im pretty
sure misses As you rush past you hear the 
of the ground behind you and bits of dirt and rock
throw up tapping the back of your head from the
impact of Kylres grasp hitting the ground
 That ends your turn
 That brings us to Caleb I need you to make
a death saving throw
 Okay thats one success in that Nott
 Yes There is an imp that just knocked Caleb
to the ground
 Yeah  feet from him
 You pull out your hand crossbow
 Ten That does not hit unfortunately It
ducks out of the way
 You move onto Calebs space and use your
body as a shield Okay that ends Notts turn
Fjord youre up
  is as close as you can get right there
 You are in its melee range which means
youll have disadvantage on Eldritch Blast
Knowing that you can take a step back
 That definitely hits Is it a natural 
 Dont do additional psychic damage it has
to be a melee weapon to do that
  points of damage All righty Fjord how
do you want to do this

 As the creature pulls its jammed hand out of
the ground after trying to strike at Jester it
turns around to watch as you approach and as you
hold the pommel outward the blast lighting up its
jaw its eyes go to a bright pink with fear as it
recoils from the blast As it hits the blast
seems to be absorbed by its blubberous form This
crack begins to  across its body Its
trying to hold itself together and the scales
begin to turn to ash Like the inside of it
burning out like the end of a cigarette the
embers glowing incinerating the interior of its
body as it slowly tries to hold its body together
It falls to its knees and then slowly the rest of
its body tumbles away into ash and dust
 The whole body doesnt burn away
 The wound where it impacted is burned up at
this point
 Two imps are still active yes That ends
your turn Fjord
 That imp is going to go after Nott who is
currently protecting the body
 Which one the one that is attacking Nott
 Okay so disadvantage on that one That puts
it at 
 As its eyes cloud over it swings with its
stinger and you feel it just barely hit the tip of
your hood and pull it back But no impact from the
stinger One will attack you Fjord That is an 
 Yeah it hits
 You suffer seven points of piercing damage
and I need you to roll a constitution saving throw
 d of poison damage that is  points of
poison damage
 That stinger is no joke man
 After the creature that summoned it is gone
the imp turns and as it runs toward you you try
and prepare and its stinger pushes past your
leather armor and pierces right through your
sternum and poison hits the inside of your system
right where the heart and lungs are and you feel
them seize up Your eyes and sight go to darkness
That ends both imps goes Molly you are up
 You can get there
 Go for it
 No You try and swing the blind rage in
your eyes but the imp whose eyesight you had
cursed hearing you approaching manages to just
get out of your range Sorry man that sucks All
right that brings us to Beau and Jesters turn
 What is the spell
 Constitution saving throw Thank you
 Five and  The one over Fjord succeeds
the one over Nott does not What does it do
 Six points of damage to the one over Nott
 Thats the one that someone damaged
 Yeah with Vicious Mockery Thats enough to
do it This bright whitishblue light begins to
burn up its body As it tries to fly away you
watch its body burn away like flash paper
 No thats a feat
 That ends your turn That brings us to
Beau
 No
 Actually I need to make another Okay
success
 Sure well call it an improvised weapon
 Youre not proficient So go ahead and roll
a straight attack roll
 Yes with disadvantage
 You hear it clatter against a tree in the
distance
 Caleb make another death saving throw
please
 Two successes All righty Nott
 Okay Go for it
 Thats what happens when you dont look
 All right Roll one more attack roll for me
please
 Six You hear a  across your
shield as a bolt from a hand crossbow almost hits
you Jester
 All right Nott does that end your turn
 Fjord I need you to make a death saving
throw Its been a long time since youve had to
make one of these in the game
 Thats a fail All righty
 Top of the round The imp Im going to
make a perception check for that imp Thats not
good enough The imp is going to go ahead and fly
over and attempt to take a swing at your duplicity
illusion
 Okay Does anything happen when the illusion
is hit
 Let me check just in case
 Okay yes So just an illusion So it
strikes and its stinger passes through with no
effect and it seems confused and figures it out
So now it knows that its an illusion but it
wasted its attack that round Illusions come in
handy for that All right that ends their turn
Molly youre up
 All righty
  does not hit Its too quick You swing
twice more and its doing figureeights around
your blades Its frustrating the shit out of
you
 All right Toya
 succeeds on her third death saving throw
and stabilizes No shes stabilised A natural 
is what wed need to see for the one All right
so that brings us to Beau and Jester
 No It doesnt work that way
 Thats right
 I mean if youre flanking it Ill allow
advantage on the attack Which is like as long as
youre on the complete opposite side of the foe
 So you can Ill say you can get
advantage
 Essentially yeah
 So yeah you can if you want to
 So youre going to try and knock it to the
ground and stomp on it is that what youre doing
Because its flying in the air All right first
strike So attack with advantage
 Yep
 All right so the first attack crushes the
imp and it hits the ground the wings go limp and
its dead but you still  and stomp down
just crushing it more and more And then its body
eventually just burns away into ash So all the
threats have been neutralised and you now have two
friends that are bleeding out
 You come back to consciousness
 Caleb I need you to make a death save
 All righty Make a medicine check
 I will say for the purposes of this you
watch as Nott pulls the porcelain mask back and
just gives Caleb the most terrifying
mouthtomouth youve ever seen Caleb the
darkness fades and you come to consciousness The
first things you notice are the cold temperature
the taste of iron in your mouth and the vision of
Nott pulling away from you like a terrifying
Nosferatu
  Temporarily blinded
 You watch as two Jesters start doing a
little skip
 A large part of the torso just burned away
The inside is partially burned out to embers in
the blast but theres still probably  percent
of the body remaining
 You would be at one hit point when you come
to consciousness Im giving you that because of
the natural  Any other roll you would just be
stabilised
 Exactly 
 This is investigation because youre poring
through the
  You find a small pouch of flesh like a
little hiding pouch that you kind of reach in a
little bit and it has kind of a mucusy liquid on
the inside As you reach in your fingers find
what appear to be a few small stones you can feel
at the tip of your fingers Do you pull them out
 You pull it out Its a handful of jewels
Looks like rings necklaces Theres actually a
few stolen pieces of jewelry that are in the pouch
as well as a few coin
 But other than that it is devoid of any
other items or objects and it looks like that was
its running fund
 Theyre still slick but easy to put on
because theyre lubricated
 You can do ritual spells and it wont take a
spell slot just takes ten minutes more of casting
time to do it
 You may So you take a little bit of time
concentrating on it At the end of the spell you
send out your extended consciousness but they do
not resonate anything magical
 They are pretty
 It just helps stabilise Theres a feat you
can take that makes it do more
 All right As you guys sit here in the
quiet you can hear the crickets now the rest of
the sound of the forest has fallen away and the
din of the battle has vanished The moonlight gets
a bit brighter as the moon climbs higher in the
sky And you all kind of look around at each
other Through this haphazard series of events
youve come to assemble a skillset that seems to
overlap pretty well And hopefully its enough to
clear your name But well find that out next
week So were going to end the episode Well be
back to continue that thread next Thursday
 I know but its 

 Sleight of hand
 I dont even think you have high enough
perception at all You have a very nice
 Yep

DD Beyond for being our awesome partner and
sponsor for the leg of this campaign Hope you all
have a wonderful weekend and is it Thursday yet
Have a good night
 Welcome back Last we left off our group of
adventurers had found their various individual
fates come together here in the city of
Trostenwald where they had attended a carnival
that had blown into town had watched a horrible
occurrence happen where one of the older attendees
transformed into this terrifying zombie creature
Upon defeating it you were all put under
investigation as possible culprits for the reason
that it occurred In trying to wander the city to
investigate and try and clear your name you
eventually found that there was a fiend hiding
amongst these carnival workers This large
devillike toad creature which through some
research you had found to actually be called a
nergaliid had killed two more of the guards
leaving you to fend with their transformed forms
and then fled deep into the center of the Ustaloch Lake

 Thank you for the punctuation Upon
gathering your supplies after a nights rest you
managed to through the trade of a bottle of wine get
passage across the lake onto the central island
which at one time housed the abode of a witch that
had long collapsed Waiting for nightfall you
approached the center of the grove that existed there on the
island and found near this ruin this same fiendish
nergaliid as well as Toya the yearold dwarf
girl who had been affixed to him for the
performances in the carnival You did battle with
this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster
of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty
heavily to the ground before you finished it off
We left off as you all were finishing licking your
wounds catching your breath and now as the
moonlit night gets its darkest in the sky you
figure out what the next step is in gathering means
of absolving yourselves of suspicion As youve
all now taken a moment to yourselves you can hear
the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and
more deafening as the silence crawls over the
center of the lake Toya the young girl still
lies unconscious The remains of the devil toad
still partially burnt from the final blow
delivered by Fjord are mostly intact above its
shoulders head and its legs What would you like
to do
 How much of the body
 The whole body with all of you could
probably fit It doesnt have the usual you
could probably fit it
 The head it would probably do but the full
body Id have to make a few rolls
 You already did
 No you do not
 Its mostly intact There are a few gashes
on it from the general fray but for the most part
its still a solid head
 Okay Its a tough form Not only is the
exterior of its flesh blubbery and a heavy
rubberlike substance that is glistening with
whatever mucuslike liquid it naturally produces
but then beneath it the muscle sinew is extremely
tough It takes you the better part of  minutes
to finally get the head entirely off the rest of
the torso It weighs enough to the point where
youre going to need one or two other hands to get
it anywhere
 Toya is passed out Youd have to try and
rouse her
 Yes they turned to ash
 Along the brow line there are these small
holes that could be breathing holes Youd have to
carry it from there under the socket or under
the jaw
 You approached just after dusk so between
the slow moving in there the combat and the rest
 At this point Molly as youre ahead of the
group and youre making your way through the
trees Toya begins to stir in your grasp Her eyes
open a bit as youre holding her and she looks up
at you confused eyes lolling around in the
sockets for a moment before they see you and
clarify Molly
 What happened
 Wait wheres Kylre She starts trying to
fight your grasp
 Shes going to try and break free of your
grasp Are you going to attempt to hold onto her
 While you guys have been doing all this
hes gone on ahead Hes probably a good  to 
feet ahead Go ahead and roll an athletics check
 Yeah that dice needs to go away
 You can choose athletics or acrobatics
 No
 That still beats her She rolled a five All
right wanted to doublecheck Shes scrambling
and as you pull her back she tries to fight for a
second and then goes limp in your grasp and goes
Im scared
 What happened
 She gets really quiet for a second You get
to the boat and the gentleman earlier that you had
passed the wine off to is sitting there waiting
He has a small pouch thats opened with some dried
meat that hes chewing on as hes waiting As you guys
  What in the hell is that
 He grabs his bag of dried meat pulls it up
and backs up I didnt know What is that What
did you do What is that
 Theres a pause before this tiny screeching
sound begins to emit from Toya This high pitched
and barely audible squeak as Toya begins to
scream
 Its hard to keep her away from that
 After Jester throws her cloak over Toya
 Shes sobbing into your arms at this point
You feel her body shaking against your grasp
 Hes recessed to the very back of his boat
wideeyed as you approach
 Youve returned to your normal halforc
form
 He reaches over grabs the oar from the
side and lifts the cloak off the face
 It doesnt look like a savory creature
 He slowly reaches out and takes it from your
hand All right I trust it was a bad thing So
Im going to take you back and then you promise
Ill never see you again
 That includes the goblin
 He glances over and takes a closer look
 Lets just get back to shore He grabs the
oar takes the bottle of wine that he had mostly
drunk by himself before and polishes it off in
one series of gulps
 As you all gather up onto the ship he
begins to paddle you back towards the western
shore of the Ustaloch to the outskirts of
Trostenwald
 What could people do with the head of a
creature like this Who knows
 They could turn it in for theres a lot of
poor folk here If they had a large looking odd
creature thats worth some gold
 Oh the sorry
 Yes youre talking about
 Yes Lawmaster Norda
 Theyre not related at all
 One of them was and they have been
discovered
 With some time he could be identified
 If theres something you want to ask me
Im right here Youre all in this boat as it
makes its way across the Ustaloch
 Can someone please explain to me whats
going on
 I mean thats the name Ive ever known
 I dont know anything about that When we
did the show the other night the horrible man
 Why
 No Wheres Gustav
 He was my friend though
 Gustav put us together for our act and he
protected me I felt safe around him He didnt
let anybody get too close I didnt want to
 He talked
 Well we talked about everybody else in the
family We talked about how I missed not having a
family He didnt talk about himself much but it
was mainly just little games
 No That was how I got by before I met
these guys
 Make a persuasion check
 As youre talking to her her eyes keep
flickering off of your face and over towards Beau
You watch her curl back into herself and get
quiet
 Im tired
 She leans into you Molly After a few
minutes she falls asleep against you
 All right were here The boat hits the
edge of the dock He hops off and pulls the rope
up Slowly manages the boat over to the side of the
dock ties it up
 Theres no boats at the dock that are being
manned currently There are a few boats out on the
water that you saw in the distance There are some
night fishermen Theres nobody immediately in the
vicinity
 Yes thats fine Just please get out of
my boat
 They got in my boat I they
 No They took over my boat and forced me to
take them to the middle island there
 Make a deception check with advantage
 He goes I want nothing to do with this
Good night He helps each of you quickly get off
the boat Ties and locks it up and makes a
beeline
 Make a strength check
 You get it partway up and it begins sliding
back into the boat and plops into the boat and
goes  and you have to catch yourself
 Its terrifying
 A doily on a couch
 Eventually you guys get it up onto the
dock
 The rest of you guys are doing
 Well get to you in just a second The rest
of you guys make a stealth check please
 Nope For those of you who are
 Thats ten
 Okay before we get to you As you guys make
your way back to the Nestled Nook Inn you come to
the intersection where the alleyway leads you back
to where the rope you had originally let down was
placed The rope is still there in the darkness
As you make your way into the alley a voice goes
Excuse me The three of you glance over and you
see a crownsguard at the end of the alley thats
currently there with his arms crossed Can I help
you
 Hes to the side You guys are all looking
up at the rope now and hes to the right of you
 Yes Its close to midnight at this time
 I would like for you to make a 
 I would like for you to make a deception
check with disadvantage please
 As Beaus on the ground frantically
searching for a shoe and Notts there in the
darkness the guard with his arms crossed goes
 He begins to walk and approach you as
two more guards close off the other side of the
alley and they begin to come up to you guys
 Too far
 To get across I would say Id allow a short
rest
 Make a sleight of hand check to see if they
notice you suddenly casting a spell or a
spelllike effect
 Okay so you Invoke Duplicity Another
version of you appears behind one of three guards
What are you doing
 Lets doublecheck this new ability that Im
getting used to
 You create an illusory duplicate of
yourself It is an illusion it cannot make
actually physical contact with anything
 Sure
 Ill say on the boat across the river
sure
 Anyway you Invoke Duplicity and you appear
behind him
 Okay
 The guard sees something quickly dart into
the shadows and continues walking towards you
 The guard approaches and goes It seems
that you have been out and about when you were
supposed to be within the inn
 Three more guards have now approached from
the front of the building and they approach and
begin pulling out manacles and chains and say
Were going to have to take you to the stockade
 Youre being locked up right now as we
speak
 Oh yeah
 Make a deception check
 That went into my nose
 As youre telling him this your mask goes
 He goes Arrest that creature
 You both are put in chains Youre put in
chains both arms and legs
 They bring you over to the stockade
Mollymauk I need you to make a stealth check with
advantage
 You guys slowly make your way through the
low grass over towards where the outside of the
carnival is As you approach you can see theres
about five crownsguard that are making rounds
around the outside It looks like where previously
they had been keeping watch over the people that
were there since the murder of two of their own
it has heightened the intensity of the watch It
looks like its fairly well watched You get the
sense at a distance that you would have a hard
time getting in there You can try and sneak her
in and sneak out but it seems dangerous
 You can try
 No you have no idea
 Which Im going to allow you to do You stay
outside of the outskirts of the torchlight at the
very front of the tent and the back of the tent
The fire of the actual encampment has gone out
because you dont see any other carnival members
The sisters ran They fled You dont see any sign
of Desmond or Ornna Make one more stealth check
for the two of you with advantage because you still
have the ability Youre at the cusp end of it
though
 You manage to pace yourself just carefully
wait for the right moment dart out of the grass
having her under your arm and shes like What
Why What is going on
 Okay You slip her into the tent and back
out none the wiser
 Okay You go back to the inn You two
Youre just waiting
 Okay You make your way to the stockade As
you approach and make your way into the interior
the two crownsguard at the front say Hold Whats
your business
 Have you been drinking
 Make an intimidation check
 Just keep it in the
 It is indeed He sits there and glares down
at you for a second your posturing this
filthy scruffy man in a coat that wandered up out
of nowhere covered in a little bit of his own
blood He just looks down at you for a second
Sorry Shes done for the night
 This whole thing can be solved first thing
in the morning Ill let you sleep it off Have
some water Come back when youre feeling a little
more yourself
 At this point you hear a voice on the
inside just like Good night good night and a
cloaked figure exits the front doorway roughly
about four and a half foot tall
 Norda is off the clock and is currently
leaving for the evening to return to her home
 Theres Norda and then Yorda because I like
to make it as confusing as possible
 Its funny When you spell things on paper
they seem so much different and when you say them
out loud theyre like Ah theyre very similar
The figure stops and turns and you hear this
audible  The figure waddles over
towards you and pulls the hood back and its
Norda All right whats this about a frog
head
 That would be preferable aye You see
bags under her eyes Shes had a long day her
hairs a bit frazzled and she looks like shes
waiting for you to finish
 Now thisll be real interesting She looks
past you and you follow her eyeline and there
you hear the sound of chains as a handful of
crownsguard with Jester Beau and Nott in
manacles approach from behind These ones
youre talking about right
 Make a persuasion check
 She goes  Hold onto them for just a
moment She walks back inside A moment passes
and she returns with four other guards
 She comes up All right Drag them along
with us Show us what this thing is and if what
you say is not true youll join them Hows that
sound
 All right
 It has been close to an hour at this point
 Using your second slot
 Oh no you can do this whenever thats
right
 Eventually you guys are led up to the
docks where you guide them
 As soon as you pull back and reveal the
face its jaw is relaxed now its muscles have sat
now that its been left in the dock and its
pooled at its base This old pumpkin look Its
tongues lolling out and unraveled on the ground
what remained within its salivary glands has
soaked the remaining wood around its base One of
the eyes has rolled back but its a horrible
display The guards take a step back immediately
at the reveal and Norda immediately gets
interested gets close takes a look at it and
begins prodding a bit with her finger
  You say its a fiend Because what
this looks like is you just murdered one of our
possible witnesses andor other members of this
investigation so Im hoping this is a fiend I
dont know fiends
 Honey Ive been doing this for a long
time Ive seen stranger Hold on just a second
She calls one of the guards over whispers to him
for a second He rushes off Just so happens we have
someone in town who might be able to confirm this
for us might help your case
 Oh they will be here shortly
 Okay and this awkward period of time with
the guards all just standing there holding you
as you wait patiently Some of them are tapping
their fingers You start rattling your chains and
two guards pull the chains taut so you cant do it
anymore Mollymauk as you begin to make your way
back into town because youre making your way
through the dock district along the lakeside and
you look up ahead and you can see theres a
couple of torches being held by crownsguard right
where the head was left and you can see Caleb
and then three of your allies in chains
 All right make a stealth check please You
do not have advantage anymore that has passed
Its been more than a hour
 Yeah its not a high DC
 You get a little closer you are still maybe
a good  feet or so away from them keeping to
the shadows along a building keeping low
Thankfully its nighttime its pushing midnight
at this point Because youre ostentatiously
dressed but there isnt a lot of light in your
colors As far as you know right now no one can
see you youre too far away to hear much but you
can keep an eye on them
 All right
 I love when they do this Chain him up
You are shackled as well
 At this point Norda is starting to smile a
bit Shes like Man if we could have more
criminals like you lot my job would be far
easier I would get home a lot earlier
 At this point the guard that had left
earlier who has been gone for about  to 
minutes or so comes back with a brisk jog
Theres another figure walking up behind him also
jogging You can see light gray hood and cloak
around and as the figure approaches into the torch
light pulls back the hood and you see this long
shoulder length curled blond hair A very very
delicate looking elven male who approaches I
believe Ive been summoned Norda Yes sorry
this is Archivist Zeenoth Hes been in town for a
few days and he comes from the library that knows
a lot about a lot of things I hope that he can
help us in this Zeenoth theyre calling this
thing a fiend What do you know about this He
steps closer kneels down next to the head
 Hmm
 Yes these creatures do frequent Xhorhas
He gives some look over pulls a small book out of
his side pouch Begins to thumb through it
compares a few things Im not a specialist
unfortunately This creature is very much a very
dangerous entity from the far east Im surprised
it made it this far into civilization before being
destroyed Its a good thing it has been He now
gets to look at everyone over the crew and goes
Are you the ones who slew it
 As the figure looks over and stops on Beau
and kind of smiles
 Oh Im an archivist Im the archivist of
the Cobalt Soul
 No Im from Zadash Im a bit out of my
depth at the moment
 Well I have business At this point Norda
goes All right you know what This is some
serious bullshite Were all just chilling here at
the docks we have confirmed thats a fiend
 A nergaliid Bring them back to the
stockade Lets have a trial They begin to pull
you guys back to the stockade Two of the guards
grab the nergaliid head and they begin dragging it
along and you guys are all being pulled
 As you guys are walking she thumbs through
and finds the page begins to read passes it to
the archivist He begins to read it He passes it
back You guys all make your way into the
stockade Youre not brought to her chambers
youre brought to a much larger room This room
has much more of a stark barren stone interior
There are benches built There is a central kind
of a pit Theres about four or five steps down
into this pit Then above that is a desk where
Norda takes as the law master As you step in you
realize oh this is a room of judgement What are
you doing
 There is a shared water closet
 Yeah theres two guards still posted there
Most of them have already left because theyre
carting off the rest of your friends
 They look at each other Yeah theyve been
arrested
 You leave our watch we cut you They both
flank you side to side and push you ahead a little
bit They are glued to your right and left
 They lead you to the stockade As you guys
are brought into this chamber Norda sets up
 Norda up there at the top takes her cloak
off puts on her ceremonial armor bits Theres a
whole element to the presentation of this You can
see her tiredly putting them on Sets her hands on
the top I would like you to present what
evidence you have to absolve you of these charges
against you and then based on what you present
Ill decide whether or not youre innocent or
guilty or require further investigation Who would
like to present evidence first You You brought
the head of a creature Youre not in chains
Well start with you They drag the creatures
head forward She takes the book from the
archivist And speaking with Zeenoth here it
appears what you said is true This creature is a
dangerous terrible fiend And looking at its
apparent ability to feast on the essence of
creatures this explains both the transformation
of the old man This also explains destruction of
our two guards who were recently discovered Rest
their soul So that explains that Convince me as
to why you were not working with this entity
especially those of the carnival She snaps her
finger again and you watch as Gustav and Bosun are
brought into the chamber as well as a third
figure who you see step out of the shadows Her
hair dark and fading to white last seen fleeing
into the distant fields you see in chains as
well Yasha being pulled into the courtroom

 That one was caught fleeing from the
scene
 Im certain You have a trustworthy face
Whats the next bit of evidence you want to
present please Anyone
 What
 Strangely not well dressed enough
 I wasnt going to go that far but Ill
admiss it
 Which one Fjord has not arrived yet
 Well say for the purposes of that as you
say that and reveal your hand Fjord enters
through the door like it was a planned arrival
 I dont know what she works for but I
dont trust her
 At this point you watch her pull back
 Make a persuasion check
 Her eyes are chained onto this goblin
 I defend no rights of this creature Ive
been in this office long enough to know that there
arent usually solo workers on something like
this I know these folk They all protect each
other Whos to say this wasnt their whole
reasoning for coming anyway and something went
wrong and theyre letting him take the fall
 I dont fucking know Dont tell me how I
do my business Sit the fuck down Whos next
 Let him up They loosen the chains and you
get to stand and approach a bit
 All right Why did this one run
 I would like you both to make persuasion
checks
 Is that goblin pissing in my court

 The dwarf woman Norda leans forward and
looks you dead in the eyes Ive known friends I
grew up with who were carved down by your kin
Convince me why I shouldnt hang you tomorrow
 Grimgolir
 Where does your clan operate from
 Thats not too far Maybe well send some
folks to pay a visit to your clan
 Make a persuasion check
 
 She leans back I want to sleep I think
youre telling the truth Most of you Archivist
does this resonate with you as well Does this
check out lorewise I dont know what the fuck
you do The Archivist is like I believe based
on what theyve stated at least its consistent
though Im a bit confused as to the demeanor of
the goblin Its not unheard of to have goblin kin
turn against their own There have been a number
of historic individuals of various monstrous races
who have been beneficial members of society
 Bring the two others forward They bring
forward Gustav and Bosun This is your circus
right He goes It is my circus and I take full
responsibility for whats happened Sincerely
They have done nothing wrong They are completely
innocent I brought this creature into our fold
and that is on me Whatever judgement you have
bring onto my head not theirs Please I implore
you Fine Ill consider the investigation
closed Youre all freed of charges against you
Including the goblin
 I would not recommend trying Okay Gustav
whats I cant read your last name Youve been
given quite a debt for Trostenwald so you shall
remain here until youve worked off the debt to
the city To the number of  gold pieces To
make up for the deaths of our two crownsguard of
the two civilians who have died and the general
cost of this entire investigation Well consider
what your work is to the city tomorrow However
go get myself some sleep
 Takes her armor off  All right Im
going to get a drink She puts her cloak on and
then hops off With the imposing sight of her on
top of a large pedestal and desk she hops down to
her natural dwarven height and its almost
adorable to watch her just skitter the hell out of
there Shes done
 Theres no response
 The chains are removed They free everybody
including Gustav but two guards are assigned to
him to keep an eye over him
 Okay As you are exiting the stockade in
the archway of the doors right outside you see
another figure standing hood up like a short
hood with a mantle that stops about midway Bare
arms and dark skin baggy gray pants and is there
waiting
 You dont recognize any details about it
You see a cloaked figure there waiting looking
right at you
 Is just beyond the doorway Its not
blocked
 I mean you can exit Theyre just on the
other side of the door Every other way in you
dont know the stockade well and all of it just
leads further into the stockade There are other
crownsguard inside
 Youre just going to bolt Full run
 Okay All right As you briskly exit and
turn to the left the figure intervenes and side
steps right in front of you
 No You dont see much of the face The hood
is up and a little bit of the moonlight is coming
you can see the edge of features The body is
muscular but thin Looks not terribly masculine
or feminine but it looks able and it moved at a
very quick speed to intercept your positioning
 Okay
 Okay As you guys are being escorted out of the
stockade Beau comes back in and joins you
 As you say that you hear a couple clears
throat and two of the crownsguard visibly bruised
that are escorting you guys out into the night air
before they eventually leave you to your own devices
 The crownsguard have pulled away and now
its just you guys and Bosun and Gustav now out
in the air and Gustav is rubbing his wrists
Well thank you everyone for helping That could
have been a lot worse And you know its fine I
know its a lot of money but shouldnt take me
more than a few years Its a nice town
Trostenwald is a nice town
 No its not but you know its better than
prison
 That there is I may have to start a small
fund for that on its own
 Wheres Ornna Wheres the twins
Wheres
 At which point Gustav just begins making a
beeline for the circus Bosun goes Oh 
 I dont know how much he saved Nowhere
near that much probably
 Gustav has spun around and comes back and is
like Sincerely I appreciate the aid but dont
This is on me Ill take care of it This is not
your responsibility Its not your responsibility
You guys have already done so much Its fine
Ill take care of it
 Make a perception check
 Ten You dont see anybody immediately
around
 No Zeenoth was still inside the courtroom when
you were leaving
 Yeah its postmidnight now
 Tell you what As a thanks well grab
Toya Well meet you guys where are you all staying
 Well come meet you at the Nestled Nook and
Ill get a round for you all As a thank you
 All right Bosun come on They make their
way off to the carnival camp
 As you make your way back to the Nestled
Nook Inn within the tavern and within the next
hour or so Gustav and Bosun Toya and Ornna all
come in and join you You guys crowd a few tables
together and under what is generally a pretty
empty tavern this night you guys for the most
part dominate the center space
 The rest of the carnival in presence Gustav
goes and orders a round of drinks to all of you
and then sits down Toya still looks a bit shaken
but seems to be comforted with the rest of the
family around her that still remain at least
Desmonds come and joined as well As youre all
sitting together for a bit theres a moment of
quiet as youre all sipping and just tiredly
thinking over the events of the evening Toya
breaks the silence Is the family going away Am
I going to be alone again Ornna looks over at
her and goes Not if I can help it Its you and
me kid against the world Bosun pats Ornna on
the shoulder and says Well if youd have me
you can probably use a strong arm Ornna looks
back at him Ornna and him have had this
rivalry tension for a while She goes You know
what Sure The trio makes for a strong pack of
performers Desmond are you in And Desmond is
just sitting there staring into his cup and goes
I see a new family before me And one I fear
thats a story I could only spoil No I thank
you but Ill find my own path And he just sits
there kind of quietly in this somewhat sad space
He gives a brief pat and side hug to Bosun before
standing up and leaving Gustav stands up and
looks around Im sorry for everything For all
the pain this has caused you for all the pain
its caused you Looks at Toya For all the pain
its caused you little one
 Everyones conscience is heavy with its own
reasoning
 I appreciate that We are our own worst
enemy are we not
 Well I think thats the end of my
carnival 
 It was a good run It was a really good
run
 You can go with Bosun and Ornna if you
like You guys are still carrying on I mean Im
not going to keep the tent Im not going to keep
the supplies I might hock some of it to try and
pay off my debt but take what you want Start
anew Its my gift to you They all kind of
Thank you very much Well start small I dont
think we need too much of the ensemble How we
began back up in Shady Creek
 They have simple dirigibles but theyre not
very functional
 Bosun and Ornna you guys can use that
tent right Yeah I think well take the tent
All right
 Gustav finishes the drink and goes Well
Im going to go get some sleep and try and figure
out how to put my life together I bid you all a
wonderful night
 Looks just like the one I lost off my
pinky
 Thats wonderful thank you so much
 Thats very sweet
 Theyre all over her fingers
 Yeah
 Gustav puts his hat on Yasha be safe and
punch anyone who gets in your way
 Mollymauk I hope you find what youre
looking for
 To the new family dont make the same
mistakes your forefathers did The rest of you
thank you
 I bid you all adieu and he exits
 Bosun and Ornna stood up and Toya is there
Yeah
 I figure Ill just move on with Bo and
Ornna and make a new show Something with a little
less death Thats what Id like
 I havent been to Nicodranas
 She looks up and tugs on the side of Bosuns
sleeve You know I actually havent been there
either
 Hmm Lets go ahead and make our way That
sounds like a nice change of pace and this empire
is getting a little stuffy for me anyway
 You watch as Ornna elbows him and is like
Oh no hes an asshole too Its fine
 She takes it and goes Its okay I know
you did what you had to But when Im older Im
going to get you back
 Is a twelve year old girl

 The three of them stand up and give a nod
wordlessly look over the rest of you with a smile
of thanks and Bosun looks to you and makes eye
contact and goes Take care brother It gets
tougher for us up north
 And they all leave the inn
 Well technically you dont have a map
 Traditionally but it can depend
 Against
 Yeah
 Roll either persuasion or deception You can
choose Dont
 I mean you dont have to say but you did
Thats fine
 All right so seems on the level
 Upstairs at the end of the hallway is a
communal washroom You can find space there
 All right
 As you guys are all finishing your drinks
and standing up to leave the table a familiar
voice pipes in from the center of the tavern
Beauregard
 And the Archivist who was there earlier
during the trial in the stockade Its been
difficult to find you Do you mind if we speak
 Yes um would you walk with me I believe
we have much to discuss
 Dont worry Shell be returned to you
Just
 All right then This way please
Beauregard
 The elvish man gives a bow and he seems
jovial

 Beau leaves and you guys are able to go
about the rest of your evening to rest however you
see fit
 Yorda is the bartender
 Yeah and Purvon
 Yorda
 Right what can I help you with
 Right thatll probably be in the
Hillsward Its a bit pricey but I dont know if
its open this late
 Oh Id put it maybe somewhere in the
neighborhood of five silver for a bath
 But you get bathed like proper multiple
people bathing you
 No Hillsward
 I mean no offense to you Their clientele
is a bit upper class
 Alright fair enough
 Okay Beau as you exit with Zeenoth As
soon as you step into the night air a second
figure flanks your other side The hooded figure
from earlier that had caught you
 It is only because its been so difficult
to find you I had to call in a favor Please
come with us We have a warehouse
 The head turns to you in the hood and you
see dark elvish features A bald head as the hood
comes back What looks to be a female elf of very
lithe form who turns to you and goes Actually
it is a woman but Ill ignore that
 It is fine
 And she walks ahead of you and the two of
you begin to make your way there Theyre guiding
you towards the Northward and as you step into the
dark following their lead were going to take a
break

Day Now jumping back into the game I would like
to ask everyone but Marisha to leave the table
please
 Beauregard
 Quietly they walk you through the night
the outskirts of the Baumbauch Family Brewery
Theres a slight opening on the side warehouse
doors where you had previously worked when you
first arrived at Trostenwald and Archivist
Zeenoth gestures for you to enter Please If you
dont mind my dear
 There is a single glowing lantern that is
currently hanging from a rope that is strewn
across the ceiling of the warehouse that gives a
central source of light to the room It causes the
shadows to stretch out very long across the
sides
 As you walk in and turn around the door is
closed The two figures approach The female elf
goes and takes a chair and sets it in the center
beneath the lantern Please have a seat
 She just sits back about  or so feet and
leans against one of the large stacks of crates as
Zeenoth approaches you Now Beauregard You have
been what the Archive would call a problematic
student
 Ive had to pull in quite a bit of a
favor
 Since I have been assigned to your
tutelage overseeing your progress and training
youve shown great promise in many ways Youre a
seeker of truth and you have a keen sense for
manipulations and falsehoods Correct
 When the Archive took you in at the behest
of your family you agreed to undergo our
discipline Our lifestyle
 Believe it or not not everyone does what
they do in this world for coin We see possibility
in you We wish to prevent you from blowing out
your own flame Your tendencies clash with our
teachings your dislike for authority
 At which point the woman from behind says
Your dislike for authority is not a bad thing It
can keep you alive Authority should always be
questioned Those with more power than you should
be held to a higher standard
 At which point Zeenoth picks up again
says But the way of the Knowing Mistress has an
order of learning Your patience is essential to
adhering to this path I know it may not be
stimulating at times but we must prepare your
mind if we are ever to prepare your soul
 Look I just wish to At which point the
elven woman goes Enough Ive heard enough
Zeenoth You are removed of your responsibility to
oversee Beauregard Zeenoths eyes go wide This
is not a student you can help Return to Zadash
Zeenoth goes Expositor I do not think that I
have been given a fair shot Please I know
this girl because I see much of myself in her
You cannot reach her Go Zeenoth looks hurt I
apologize that I failed you He turns around and
heads back towards the warehouse doors which
shift open and close
 The woman now steps forward
 Maybe youre an asshole You probably are
an asshole Thats all right because so am I
Because sometimes you need someone to be an
asshole to get shit done
 I am Expositor Dairon of the Cobalt
Soul
 DAIRON I take it you have heard of
our station through whispers
 We are the hidden strength of the library
you are not wrong We wade in the filth of
society We weed out the corrupt We pursue the
secret evils of the world and expose them to the
light
 We twist the arm of the unjust until they
spill their mysteries We are the spies We are
the hunters We are the watchmen to those who
rule We are not kind We are forthright We are
truth Do you Beauregard want to see the truths
of the world
 Whats your armor class
 You suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage
as out of nowhere her fist hits you right across
the side of your face
 Youre unconscious
 Okay Are you listening now
 Let me be your teacher
 No What do you want to do now that thats
happened
 Then do it
Whats stopping you
 Go for it Roll for an attack
 Yep
 She dodges out of the way and as you move
past plucks you in the back of the head with a
knuckle That hits You take one point of
bludgeoning damage Its a very light tap
 With that she rushes around with a rapid
pace to the front of you feints with an upper
cut and then goes to elbow you in the side of the
head That is a  Whats your armor class
 Misses You manage to duck out of the way of
it She goes Good Good
 Okay Shes going to go ahead and use her
bonus action to go into a defensive stance
Come on
 Oh shit
 Two natural s in a row
 No I can see it
 Roll damage on those first two
 Yeah Roll the dice double it
  points of damage Then the third strike
that hit
 You watch as her defensive stance shes
prepared for it and as you go to swing she lets
it down at the last second and lets you get some
hits in Wham wham But much stronger than she
expected The first one clocks her across the
chin The other one hits her across the temple
The last one
 Just hits her in the back of the head She
stumbles for a second then spins around You can
see a bit of blood trickling out of the corner of
her mouth and theres a little bit of a scrape of
dirt on the side her head where you hit She turns
around Very good You have learned some things
in your time She quickly advances on you Hits
 hits Okay You take three points of
bludgeoning damage one per hit Pop Pop pop She
is basically going full in with the strike and is
just prodding you with these gentle little hits
showing control showing that shes entirely able
to overwhelm you and shes hitting different
places on your body strategically Because with
each hit you feel this burst of numbness in those
vicinities I need you to make a constitution
saving throw
 Okay After each hit you gather yourself
for a second she stops and goes You are quick
and there is intelligence lying in there You are
also quite nimble at dodging blows Do you see
with but a few simple strikes Im able to extract
from you everything I need to know about you
 You see brute force has its place But
precision and intent That can take down the
greatest of mountains by poking the weakest
point Now I know where your weak points are
 Go for it
 Nope With each miss or the first miss
shes going to use a reaction to attack you
Thats going to be She can do that Ducks out of
the way and immediately uses a reaction to smack
you in the head for one point of damage another
bludgeoning point Shes going to spend another ki
point to do another reaction She can also do
that
 For your second one yeah
 Yeah the second one does hit She does not
get the second attack Roll damage on that second
strike
 All right What was the damage on that
 Eight damage nice You crack her in the
ribs and the impact actually does catch her off
guard She ends up tumbling five feet backward
across the ground catching herself in a
threepoint landing
 Okay Patient defense You go into that
stance that she was in earlier but holding it for
the entirety of this Her eyes narrow for a
second You see her looking at all the different
points that she struck on you earlier like shes
reading some sort of a docket on what your
physicality is With that she doesnt run at you
she runs around you in a circle and begins to jump
off the sides of the boxes some of the crates
that are stacked up nearby You watch them wiggle
as she puts her weight up against them leaps
off
 Okay Eventually she uses her momentum to
climb to the top with her feet and leap off then
come downward with the knee towards you
 Youre already in your defensive stance so
her attacks at disadvantage against you The
first strike   to hit
 Correct what the dodge action does is it
means any attacks against you have disadvantage
 The first one did hit Second one does not
The third one does Two hits still get you Both
one point of bludgeoning damage The knee comes
down and right as it cracks into your head she
shifts to the side and glides off and as soon as
her body glides off her back is to yours and her
spinning elbow goes and cracks you in the side of
the head but it stops short just barely hitting
you Shes toying with you at this point
 Yes two more points of bludgeoning damage
Make another constitution saving throw please
 This time opposed to the pressure points
being hit there is the one smack on the side of
your head
 This pain surges through the side of your
temple and travels through your spine to all the
points she had hit earlier and your whole body
tenses and seizes for a second Your vision blurs
and your mouth stammers and youre stunned for
the next round As she lands behind you and walks
around to the front of you youre unable to you
cant move you cant speak I can start you on
this path You can return to your wanderlust your
allies Our kind learns more in the world than in
a library Agree to my instruction to use the
skills I teach you as you return throughout your
journeys One day you too can become an
expositor You begin to regain control of your
senses and your speech begins to slowly return to
you
 Very well Your first lesson begins now
 She snaps her fingers and you watch as
Zeenoth steps back in sheepishly Is it over my
dear Is it done I need you to stand here for a
second Zeenoth I need a body Let me show you
the proper pressure points Zeenoths eyes go
wide for a second I dont believe You owe me
a favor I found her for you did I not Zeenoth
sighs sags his head and takes his cloak off
 Now depending on what you wish to learn
there are different places where you can pull the
information from the body Over the next few
hours working with you and over time
 You both do
 Assholes that the world needs from time to
time
 Ill return to Zadash in the morning Take
what I have taught you When you feel its time
for more tutelage return to me Do not worry I
have an eye on you
 Do what you must Travel the world Use
what Ive taught you Learn about injustice Those
you dont trust follow them Bend them Make them
tell the truth and admit their guilt Find where
ever corruption is Root it out and let the system
do its job If the system isnt doing its job
destroy the system
 Because a long time ago I was a wayward
girl with no direction was angry and fighting at
the world And someone did this for me
 Perhaps Who knows Maybe one day youll
find the corruption inside our own
 Go Get some rest Clean up a bit I think
you could use it
 Itll heal Zeenoth She slaps him awake
His unconscious body on the ground
 
 Oh dear
 Goodbye I have such great pleasure in
saying goodbye and good riddance
 You make your way back to the tavern go
back into the room and exhaustedly pass out
Lets bring everyone else back in
 As you all come to consciousness in the
morning little sore but recoveredmostlyfrom
the battle that wrecked you the evening before
The fresh smells of cooked meats and the sounds
of various patrons below in the inn tavern floor
rouse you to the morning What do you wish to do
 Shes beat to shit
 Make a medicine check
 Okay Its actually fairly well made it
gives some nice support to it I mean its more
of a sprain than a break But it helps offer some
support to it Itll heal
 Yeah no it hurts like a bitch or it did
last night Or it feels a little better today but
thats definitely going to help give it some
support Good job
 You dont have to tell me what youre
rolling
 Okay Roll a dexterity check Why not
 Its very well done Theres like hatch
mark shading
 All right what are you guys doing The rest
of you while they rush off to go about their
errands
 Molly and Yasha are heading back to the
carnival grounds
 You guys where are you heading off to
 You head inside It looks as chaotic as you
left it You see what looks to be a small bowl of
heated porridge thats gathered on the counter
and crosslegged on top is the fantastic gnomish
purveyor of the interior Oglen Hello
 Good day to you as well
 Breakfast
 All sales are final
 Make a persuasion check
 You watch as some of the porridge is
spilling out the side of his mouth and he rubs it
off All right And he pulls a gold coin out of
his pouch
 Might I have the book
 All sales are final
 Do you want it I can sell it to you for
three gold
 Make an investigation check You guys keep
just shaking down this poor gnome guy
 Looking around I mean a lot of this is
knickknacks and inane garbage and things that
just arent quite worth what youd be looking for
You do find one art piece that looks like its a
pretty good art piece with a decent frame might
be worth a little bit but thats the best you can
find Everything else here looks like its the
dingy side of the Salvation Army
 Yes Ill let you do that It has not moved
from where you placed it
 Make a sleight of hand check please
 It is a music box 
He takes it and cranks it
 It was a music box
 I can fix it
 He breaks it open looks inside Three
days
 Happy sales as well
 Yeah he did not notice at all
 You guys make your way southward Go ahead
and make a general charisma check
 Okay Specific and easily done
 Straight charisma Add your modifier
  okay With your Disguise Self form its
easy enough for you to ask a few questions and
eventually you are given directions to what is
called the Warm Dew Bathhouse Warm Dew
 DEW
 Itll be one before you bathe there and the
other when you leave

 For as far south as this is its pretty
decent compared to the other areas Most of the
Hillsward you get the sense that a lot of the
rural farming community that fills out most of
Trostenwald a lot of the money that gets made
goes directly to the central portion of this ward
where this bathhouse is Its small but its
really well put together As you walk inside you
can see there are marble busts set on the sides of the
entrance way each side You can see nice
tapestries that are pulled back over the windows
and as both of you walk in you see this young
man maybe his midtwenties or so Human but he
looks very thin and sickly like he had a rough
upbringing and his general constitution has
suffered for it He has a warm smile and hes
wearing these long white robes with what looks to
be a yellowish scarf thats wrapped around as he
approaches Hello and good morning Can I help
you
 Im very sorry
 That can be done Of course Make a
persuasion check
 For two hours that will run for two
baths adjoining well put it at eight silver pieces
 Wonderful Well show you to your
bathroom
 You guys are escorted to what Its really
offputting for the two of you Not only is the
smell clean inside here but theres the scent of
lavender in the hallway and you hear soft music
in the distance As you walk past you do see that
there is a resident violinist that plays and you
guys are led to these two
 Right this way Leads you into the
chambers There is a glass fogged window so the
sunlight comes through but no one can see
through There are some linens set out a towel
and two basins that are freshly filled with
steaming water You are left into the chamber
 Theyre separated by a small wall thats eye
length but you can still talk to each other over it
 The illusion stays Strangely clothes start
apparating out of you 
 You are actually There is one incomplete
arcane inscription in there Unfortunately its
been too burned beyond recognition You can see
this was a spellbook Mostly destroyed but there
are two complete spells in there that if you wish
to you could transcribe over into your book
Those would be Arcane Lock and Unseen Servant
 Because you paid for it there is a hinged
small desk piece where food can be eaten or
drinks could be served while people are taking a
bath
 As you hear over the wall 
 Plenty of things actually No ones
watching Theres a vase thats really nice The
doorknob itself is a brass goldlike material
 Using your thieves tools you can get that
free if you want
 Okay You get a water flask
 Okay Go ahead and make a thieves tools
check adding your dexterity
 Add the dexterity and your proficiency
 There you go With very little sound the
doorknob comes off and you have now a solid brass
doorknob There is the vase
 Its like that big Its more of a
decorative flower holder over by the window
 Easy You get it Theres nobody watching
you
 Okay There you go
 Yeah the linens can be taken
 Easy enough Theres some nice clean
bandages Good
 While you guys are taking a bath the rest
of you are going off on a shopping trip Except
for you youre going to
 Thats right Youre going Whos all going
together
 Where are you going
 Theres not much of a specific cartographer
in place Most of the cartography guilds are up
north in either Zadash or Rexxentrum There might
be one in Alfield Were a bit small over here
You could ask the general store or you could
maybe go to the stockade They have maps there but
they use those You might be able to pay enough
for them
 Then maybe check the general store or any
of the strange book places might have something
old and lying in the back
 Well lets see Theres the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding Theres the Burnished
Bibelots that I think one of your friends has
already been to Those are the two strange book
places Im not much of a reader myself so I
couldnt tell you
 She gives you directions
 Where are you guys going first
 Everythings coming up Jester
 All right so you guys make your way to
Lochward General in the Lochward District As you
enter the older woman Harper Mince is there in
the general store Its the large almost wooden
barn exterior The front door opens two ways and
the inside is walltowall lined with tools for
farming and farming equipment for building
Theres lumber Theres all sorts of iron nails
Its by all accounts a rural general store
You see on far end is Harper the older
woman there standing and looking out at the rest
of you Hi can I help you What are you looking
for
 No we dont sell pickles here sorry
 We can order some pickles if you like
 The area Let me check Ill be right
back
 Yeah she does She leaves the room
 Make a sleight of hand check
 With nary a squeak you completely rearrange
in a period of about two and a half minutes most
of the price cards that are dangling from a number
of the tools their placement You guys all sit
back and watch as this glorious display you can
almost hear the William Tell Overture begin to
play in the back of your head as she rummages back
and forth throughout the interior of the chamber
turning things around and sticking them in the
ground It has been completely rearranged
 Eventually you hear some rummaging from the
back room and some footsteps coming nearby and you
quickly stop and return to your original point
there and Harper Mince returns from the back room
She has a few papers in her arms She goes Im
sorry we dont have any maps of the local area
for detail I have a map of the Dwendalian Empire
as a whole I hope thats enough
 All right let me look at the date here
This will run about seven silver
 Right yes let me go ahead and get that
for you here The healers kit Looking up the
pricing in the equipment sectionThat is five gold
pieces for the healers kit

 All right mark it off You get yourself a
secondary healers kit
 You hand over the seven silver
 She takes it and put the ribbon back on it
Finally get to give that to you guys
 I designed the layout but the map is made
by a wonderful woman named Deven Rue who does
incredible handcrafted maps
 You guys are in Trostenwald right there
This is north this is south
 This is the Dwendalian Empire This is not
all of Wildemount this is just a portion Deven
did an incredible job with this You should follow
her on Patreon or Twitter she does amazing work
She does incredible work
 By the way Deven who did the map it is
her birthday today
 She did an incredible job The exchange is
done you have your map Anything else you guys
want to handle
 Theres plenty of tools There are various
packs of supplies
 Over time you would run out of it
 Good for a while
 Im sorry were a bit out of the center of
the country for arcane items Youd want to go
further north for that
 Of course
 Take your map
 Thank you very much
 I um
 As you guys all exit she begins to come
around the counter
 You can probably get a cart
 Technically its a vardo and the three of
them took it Theres a vardo and then theres
some carts You werent rolling with a pretty
heavy honestly most of the room in the carts
was either for carrying you guys whatever small
bags you had with you and the poles you would
assemble to make the tent Are you guys done with
your business Anything else you want to do while
youre out and about
 Theres Natural Remedies which youve
passed before but not entered Its an herbal
healers establishment
 Now you guys had left earlier so as you
guys head toward Natural Remedies you guys finish
your bath
 Yeah
 All right As you guys exit
 I trust you enjoyed your time at the bath
thank you
 Yeah amongst other things You guys make
your way out and beeline it towards the Lochward
to where you would find Natural Remedies The rest
of you guys as you approach the exterior amongst the
rest of the buildings in the central city Natural
Remedies is for lack of a better term humble
Its a small shack but as soon as you approach it
has very strong pungent smells of funguses
 Yep On the outside you can see right where
the doorway is open there are strings of herbs
that are tied up and left to dry out On the
inside you can already see that there are shelves
of various flora and fauna that are being
cultivated for various remedies and means of
selling to anybody who wants to come by and
procure herbal medicines Lets see whos
handling this one because you guys have not been
here yet As you enter the main chamber
 Okay easily enough so you guys havent
arrived yet You guys have arrived As you enter the interior
its a very musty smell on the inside too
Theres a lot of fungus being grown on the inside
here and you can see that elements of it may have
expanded into the corners of the actual room and
its not necessarily the nicest space to be
wandering in It seems natural Across the way
you see a gentleman of relatively tanned skin
with darker hair thats ratty and clustered Hes
in his late twenties or so looks to be upon
closer inspection partial elven blood partial
human blood and hes in the process of carefully
carving a large stalk of what looks like a fungus
off of a small pot that he pulled off one of the
shelves As you enter he doesnt even make eye
contact He goes Hello please just wait a
moment There we are Hi can I help you
 We have a handful that is correct How
many are you looking to purchase
 Four
 What do you do for a living
 Why would Fine who am I to ask
 I cut fungus for a living
 Im not going to ask Four Did you want
them
 For four healing potions and he pulls
them out and plops them on the table  gold pieces
 Make a persuasion check with disadvantage
 No actually I think its rather standard
in these parts But I can put them back
 Oh I create all sorts of means of tending
to wounds and loss of stamina To be honest a lot
of people come around here for
performanceenhancing fungus
 Make a persuasion check
 Nope
 He leans in close to you Mind closing the
door
 Keep curious company thats true
 Those are magical words for a man of my
business Are you a fan of skein
 Well and he goes back into the back
chamber comes back with a small satchel Theres
a finely dried dusted material on the inside it
has a grayishblue color to it He goes This is
a dried and ground fungus called skein Its
called skein because when you eat it you can see
the weave of time
 Its a woven skein its a joke on fate
never mind
 Thank you very much Its effective its
popular on the outskirts where its not so heavily
controlled and carries a huge jailtime if caught
How much are you looking to purchase
 Sure go for it
 Go for it
 Sure
 You know what Make your insight check
 Straight insight
 Not as good as I hoped
 
 Seems on the level seems excited that
somebodys asking about it You get the sense
that maybe he makes a lot of this either for
himself or in hopes that somebody asks about it
and is seemingly excited that somebody in this
bumfuck town in his opinion would even have
interest You have once encountered this substance
before and it does seem legit
 Hey guys were dealing DD drugs
 Ill put you in at a gold an experience
how about that
 He takes a small little batch of this dried
powdered fungus and puts it into a small glass
vial corks it and hands it over
 Skein SKEIN I believe thats how its
spelled
 God damn it guys
 Youre right I am not making any of this up
on the spot at all
 Make a persuasion check with advantage
  gold and he pulls his hair back a bit
Seems fair Takes a potion and hands it over He
scoops a little vial and says And for fun He
throws it over
 TPK by misuse
 This has become the longest afterschool
special I think weve ever experienced
 He immediately gets nervous at her mention
of
 Ill be here
 Of course not I dont know who you are
 At which point you run outside just as
Caleb and Nott are approaching
 Davies
 You bump into Caleb and Nott on the way
out
 Actually ironically his clothes do still
smell pretty bad and he still looks awful
 Thats true on a gradient scale he does
smell a little better
 Easily enough
 Thats the size of the map
 Following the road is longer but its
safest Thatll probably be close to  miles to Zadash
 You do have a cart A single cart
 No you guys traveled around You went from
Felderwin and curved around to the Ustaloch
 Alfield is actually slightly smaller than
Trostenwald its a stop on the way to Zadash
Zadash is the secondlargest city in the kingdom
 It was the last conquered bastion of the
previous government before the empire entirely
took the valley
 It was but now its more central It
expanded past and took over Trostenwald Alfield
it expanded all the way into the valley
 The Soltryce Solstice I can see you mixing
it up The Soltryce is technically in Rexxentrum
which is the capital of the empire
 Which is a lot farther Zadash does have the
only other subsidiary of the academy there but
the main Soltryce academy is in Rexxentrum the
capital But Zadash has some connection to it
 Yes its huge For player comparison its
twice the size of Emon Its a massive city
 No not Zadash Rexxentrum
 To Zadash roughly  miles or so if
youre taking the road quicker if you take a
straight line but youre not as safe
 Itll be about the same pace as on foot At
a fast pace on foot you guys can traverse about
 miles a day That also means youre moving at a
fast pace so youre not being completely aware of
your surroundings you have a penalty to passively
seeing things around you But you get there quicker
 Blindspot
 There are messenger services yeah
 Yeah okay For the purposes of brevity
well say that you find a courier service that
runs fast horseback all along the roads from the
Empire and then with approval outside of it
to the south and west
 All right For delivery to Nicodranas the
cost of the courier service will run you about
five gold
 Thats hundreds and hundreds of miles on
horseback
 Yeah Welcome to level three after
tonight
 Sure Its a young girl with shortish
brushed hair shes boyish and freckled and a
bit dirty in the edges of her chin shes in the
process of loading up the packs on the horse and
shes wearing simple leather armor and looks back
at you Can I help you
 Make a deception check
 Let me check Yeah actually weve got three
small parcels on the way to the Baumbauchs there
 Thats very kind thank you
 Hops onto the horse and takes off
southward
 Three parcels
 All right With that her vocal expulsion is
majestic and sudden Make an animal handling check
with advantage please
 The sound that comes out is less of a
Yeehaw and more of a screech sound The horse
immediately rises up and goes into a very heavy
gallop and the cart takes off ahead of you and
you all struggle to catch up for a bit With that
you guys quickly try and saunter up heading
northward along the road towards the direction of
Alfield and eventually Zadash as you head
further into the Dwendalian Empire and whatever
fate has in store for you the next leg of your
journey Well stop tonights session there
 You paid your inn fee
 You guys are all level three when you come
back next week

 Yeah thank you guys for sticking around for
a less intense more characterdriven episode
these early days of figuring each other out and
forming a fellowship This is fun I love it
 I know
 Thank you guys for watching Thank you
again Deven for being an incredible artist and
an incredible mapmaker for working with me on
that Her Twitter I shouldve had this prepared
in advance You can follow Deven on Twitter
devenrue Mistress of Maps Her work is
incredible She has a Patreon which Im a patron
for you should be too Its her birthday so say
happy birthday to her
 All right guys have a wonderful week
Ashley come back
 If anybody from Blindspot is watching right
now kill off her character I mean dont do
that but we want her back
 Its fine We just miss her a lot Well see
you guys back next week Much love to you much
love to you and is it Thursday yet
 And welcome back
 I have to
 Except when I dont which makes it a
challenge for you guys which does not help me
Anyway last we left off the group of adventurers
whose fates are slowly entwining found themselves
meeting in the city of Trostenwald on the southern
reaches of the Dwendalian Empire on the continent
of Wildemount Through a mishap in a circus
passing through town you began to give chase to
the investigation that has caught you up in this legal
issue and you found yourselves locked under house
arrest and being considered possible murderers
You sought the answer to this endeavor you found
the devil toad or the nergaliid as you
discovered was responsible You hunted it down
slew it brought its head back and after arguing
with a very tired and wanting to get it over with
lawmaster in Trostenwald managed to convince her
enough to let you off the hook and leave most of
the standing legal issues with Gustav thus
disbanding the circus and setting you and Yasha
free Yasha went on her own path while the rest of
you the six of you decided strength in numbers
and at the time being you all seem to enjoy each
others company Purchasing a fresh
map looking at your future prospects and your
dwindling funds you decided to head northward
towards the city of Zadash by way of the Golden
Road past the city of Alfield And that is where
we left off as you had smacked the rear end of
the single horse and cart and sent it spooked
into the northern field
 You do You chase after it to keep up
 Being relatively before noon at this point
in time youre heading northward along the Amber
Road The wellpacked dirt of the tenfoot roadway
gives you a clear path towards your next
destination The gentle creak of the cart mingles
with the clomping of the horse hooves as you push
forward The midday air is warmer than you
expected The skys common gray presence is broken
into smaller cloud patches the victorious blue
peeking through You guys continue for a few hours
talking amongst yourselves a bit If there are any
questions you wish to ask each other now is
the time
 Meaning if there is anything coming out of
the city you wanted to talk about otherwise Im
going to continue to push forward with your
journey So stop me at any point
 Make a perception check
 You can see there is some faint bruising
starting to show on the left side of the face
 Imagination
 No hit point transition no constitution
saves Theyre a bit stale but still tasty enough
 You can chose to remove it if youd like
but it may be part of the texture It adds color
 Ironically traveled in the exact wagon that
youre in right now
 You watch as he balances one on the edge of
the hand and then tosses it up and catches it as
it falls and takes the other one and glides it
across spins it up catches it on his chin On
his nose he makes it hop around Its pretty
decent
 Make an acrobatics check if you want to
try
 A few hours into travel along the road you
catch ahead the sight of another caravan heading
southward in your direction They begin to crest
over one of the hills As you look forward too
the central portion of the Marrow Valley isnt
just a smooth constant grade Its a series of
rolling hills and high grasses and wheats and
grains and a lot of wild weeds that have taken
over the areas between bastions of civilization
 You can see up there about maybe a half mile
or so as they crest over one of the hills in the distance
 He cant hear you right now unfortunately
 As your vision crests up with the flight of
Frumpkin make a perception check for Frumpkin
 Its a two
 Okay I mean at a safe enough distance to
look down there are shapes The most that
Frumpkin makes out is that it looks to be six
heavy wagons
 Six heavy wagons each being pulled by a
trio of horses
 Well say for the purposes of this
 Coming closer down the road now the gap
between your traveling troupe and this caravan
grows smaller and smaller All the rest of you
Id like to make a perception check please I
think at this point Frumpkin has
 Amongst all of you guys keeping an eye out
you look ahead and you can see the wagons are
covered some of them are bundled some of them
are taller some of them are smaller What you do
notice is at the front of each of the wagons
theres a figure with the reins that is in the
process of sitting there and occasionally making
sure the pace is kept relatively steady forward
You do see by the long robes and ornate silk
mantles of the highwaymen that are holding these
reins you get the impression that they probably
are from the Menagerie Coast You two in
particular recognize its not welloff mercantile
clothing but it looks like its not rags for a
person that makes this trek up and down the Amber
Road Looks like theyre heading southward
probably returning after completing some sort of a
trade run up to either Zadash or Rexxentrum and
spaces nearby As the gap begins to close theres
a brief moment of chicken to see whos going to
avert the path as its only about ten foot wide
It would be a pretty tight fit to get both your
troupe and their wagons past Do you guys yield or
do you continue to push forward
 You guys skirt your single horse poor
thing is pulling this cart on its own
 Its not going any faster really than you
guys walking necessarily

 Because it is not a riding horse it is a
beast of burden so its about the same pace that
youre going As you guys pull slightly off into
the grass the cart bumps as it hits some rocks
and patches of dirt and thick grass They continue
to pass and as they do you see the individuals
The one in the front has what looks to be a thick
scarf tossed over the shoulder obscuring part of
the face and she gives a hand salute up to you as
it passes and a bit of a head nod As you wave your
hand frantically a bit of eye contact is made and
continues past
 No response The first cart continues past
 The next one looks over to you for a second
the head cocked a little bit No we are on our
way to Port Zoon
 By way of Nicodranas
 We briefly did yes but we are returning
We have finished our wares and we have things to
bring back to sell
 Uh At this point hes passed by you and
his voice gets a bit louder over his shoulder and
hes like From this point its probably around
 miles
 The next one continues one after another
You get a better look too The ones at the front
that were pretty heavily covered as opposed to
the ones in the back which are a little taller
and as you look into the back theres little
flaps and openings on the inside you can see
theres families traveling
 Make a perception check
 Glancing through you can see the three
wagons towards the back seem to be more for
transport of people It seems like either these
merchants are bringing their family with them for
long treks so theyre not apart from them for so
long or their family is just a family of traders
or transport Looking past them you can see there
are a lot of supplies behind them but youre not sure
if theyre wares or just their personal goods
 The fifth carts now passed Youre moving
on to the sixth cart
 Make an insight check
 They dont look sad necessarily Theyre on
the road just kind of looking out and keeping
eyes on the vicinity and probably lost in thought
You do see a pair of children hard to gauge their
age at this distance but theyre under the age of
ten at least and they seem to look relatively bored
 You watch as the young boy he has tangled
black hair that poofs out a bit on the sides he
has a deeper brown skin and he looks up at you
with his bright blue eyes As soon as you begin
balancing the sword he smiles a little bit and
jabs his elbow into his sister whos a little bit
older than him who glances over and points They
both point towards you You dont hear anything
They just point and smile as their cart pulls
away the sixth cart making distance from you
 The caravan continues without you
 Continuing on your path I want to ask which
two of you are taking point in keeping an eye on
the road and the landscape around you as you
progress
 Okay Beau and who else
 So the two of you are taking point up until
you guys decide to change it when it comes to
travel along the road
 Yes I would like you both currently about
an hours journey past that intersection with the
other caravan to make a perception check
  and eight Actually both of you dont
really notice anything
 Both of you keeping an eye out the hills
continue to roll You see patches of trees and
small wooded areas Grass field is tall but its
beautiful and the light breeze that blows through
you can see the waves of wind as they come across
You can hear the faint sound of it moving the
fields across
 There is Its maybe about  feet off the
road but you can try and head over there if you
want to
 Id say total right now youve been
probably on the road for about four hours
 All right So you guys leave the cart on the
road or do you take it off to the side
 I mean you can The progress will slow a
bit because youre now taking it through the hills
and the field and having to push the cart through
the grass
 As the rest of you take a moment to step off
to the side of the road pull out some of your
travel supplies to feed the horse give it a
rest
 Pick some flowers which you can find
Theyre wildflowers Theyre bright white
scattered and simple but theyre beautiful in their own
right You all take a bit to relieve yourselves a
little ways off the road You make your way
towards the nearest tree and its a cluster of
about five or six that are nearby this pocket
where it seems like some seeds long ago got
dropped by a bird probably over the sky and
then proceeded to grow and sprout The lowest
branch is about ten feet up so youre going to
have to take a quick leap and try and climb some
of it
 Oh thats right youre waiting there
Never mind You see that tree and you go Ill
get to that later
 Your eyes cloud over
 No you guys were quite a ways off No one
was in earshot
 A ladybug lands on his nose and goes in his
nostril but he cant feel it
 Maybe not this Youre too focused
 It tickles a little bit
 To be fair your face itches in general from
the sheer amount of filth thats on it Its hard
to really differentiate
 Make a perception check for your birdie
 Glancing over and doing a wide pass around
as everyone begins to gather their things and head
towards the cart the roads pretty open At this
point the previous caravan is invisible from that
height the hills close that distance You dont
see anything coming your way It seems pretty open
and safe
 Okay
 Okay cool Its a nice view

 Make an investigation check
 Shh dont spoil it
 No carvings of names or letters but you do
see a few knots in the tree that have currently
been carved out and made a home to a number of
woodland creatures
 Eventually you all gather yourselves again
back at the wagon cart it back onto the road and
head northward Another few hours pass before the
sun begins to set As the sky grows darker the
clouds from the northnortheast begin to filter in
with a colder wind You get the sense that the
warm day that you had is coming to a close and who
knows how long the current cold weather will keep
The light begins to fade darker and darker until
you get the sense that you have about  minutes
before this field goes pitch black
 You can see your breath
 Not super thick but when you exhale you see
a bit of the breath before you
 There are no mountains anywhere in the
vicinity Youre in the center of the rolling
hills There is a cluster of trees you could go to
thats about  feet or so off the road Its
three trees so its not a lot of cover but
unfortunately youre in the middle of a valley
 It takes you a little bit You spend about
 minutes in pitch dark keeping an eye in that
direction before you come upon the tree You can
faintly see the outline of the tree against the
faint bit of light making it through the cloud cover
You guys stop there get the horse a little bit of
water and feed and the sites yours
 Whos starting the fire
 You can do that
 With that light its easy enough to find
some small kindling Theres not a whole lot in
the vicinity mainly being that its an open
field But you find a few pieces of fallen tree
and general dead plant life in the vicinity that
can get something going
 Eventually you get a fire going Its a
little beacon of light here in the darkness
orangeish flickering against the interior
of the three trees as you guys are situated there
You figure youve made it a little under halfway
to Alfield which is the small city on the way to
Zadash Itll take you a little over a days
travel or if you push it ahead you could probably
make it in a day but you can run the risk of
getting tired But for resting this evening who
wants to take watch
 Okay
 All right Well say for the purposes of
expediency on this Ill take three perception
rolls from three different people that are keeping
watch throughout the evening So with the setup of
your spell you go to rest Jester you first
 All right natural one About ten minutes
 About ten minutes into your watch the
inspiration hits for you to start drawing
interesting faces and weird trees You start
sketching
 There you go As you begin to sketch you
are not paying attention at all to the area around you
 Giant miniatures space unicorns However
even though you rolled really poorly your watch
goes through unabated Second watch whos taking
that
 All right Go ahead and roll a perception
check please
 Okay Keeping an eye out you see a little
ways off its hard to make out any shapes
because of your human eyes and with the firelight
thats near you your eyes cant adjust to the
darkness as well but there are bits and pieces
where the clouds do break the moonlight comes
down and you can see a distant shape thats moving
through the field maybe about  feet off You
can see it pushing through the height of the
grass moving slowly
 Yep
 Make a stealth check
 You vaguely see the shape moving but its
hard to see and only because of the moonlight
Nott as you stealth up and quickly move through
the grass eventually you hear this 
You glance up and see there is not one
but three large buffalotype creatures that are
lumbering through the fields
 Youre not sure Youre not close enough to
see You see theyre bipedal theyre thick and
muscular and they have these large horns that
curl off to the side and out
 Sorry quadruped not bipedal
 Youre about maybe  to  feet from it
 The whispers continue back and forth
 For one round
 Its a cantrip
 Essentially
 So Nott what are you doing
 Theyre just moving As you head back to the
camp you can see they pass and continue heading
in the southwestern direction in the field not
taking notice of your fire or the encampment
 Yes
 While Molly and Jester continue to enjoy
their continued long rest you all interrupt it to
get up and head in the direction of these
creatures I would like you all to make a stealth
check please
 All right The four of you shoulder to
shoulder keeping low making your way through the
field stepping ever so carefully And theres
this  as one of you accidentally goes
completely foot down on to some sort of field frog
that had been there As the croak hits you watch
as one of the creatures  and
they all start running away spooked by the sound
 Make a perception check if you want to
 At disadvantage on you unfortunately at
this distance
 They look like buffalolike creatures
 They look like buffalo
 You arent too familiar with a lot of the
indigenous animals that live or have been brought
to this region if they havent been near the port
towns that you grew up in You havent seen these
types of creatures before but you vaguely know
theyre in the ballpark of what a buffalo you
imagine looks like
 All right Molly has the third watch
 Perception check please
 Okay As you keep an eye out everyone else
sleeps throughout the evening Eventually you nod
off and fall asleep with the rest of them I
would like to ask all of you to leave the table
for a moment except for Fjord
 Yeah
 Fjord as darkness takes your mind
dreamless like most you await the emptiness of
sleep to carry you to the day Your sense of body
fades but your mind and the dark linger Minutes
hours days Time loses real sense and meaning
but youre conscious for it and that is almost
maddening in that split second or endless stretch
of experience that youre currently unable to
express As the time passes the air grows colder
around you The faint shimmer of shifting midnight
blue muted and distant now showing endless depth
before you rippling You begin to flail about
your senses returning with the dropping
temperature but there is resistance to your limbs
as you push in the space around you Youre
sluggish Theres force Its not air its water
You suddenly feel the burning pain in your lungs
as your breath fights to escape you but you hold
tight You seize and swim in desperation choosing
any direction but the shimmering blue is
directionless There is no up there is no down
Its just depth Movement The universal shadows
dance as one right to left With a speed that
pulls you along with the current you feel
yourself being jostled As it shifts again to the
left to right around behind you you find
yourself toppling head over end eventually
coming to rest again You spiral over and over
again the darkness swallowing you tightening
around you as this dance this shape this endless
coil this spiral around you As the current tugs
at you battering you you cannot fight any more
as the increased power of the current pulls on
your form You cough and the freezing waters rush
into your body the briny taste of salt water
stinging your insides Your wincing eyes open with
the pain that clutches the interior of your chest
only to see a gargantuan mass moving through the
water around you like a massive noose closing in
The pain in your chest vanishes As your breathing
normalizes thicker than air but breathable all
the same it feels strange yet weirdly familiar
In that moment yellow light bursts before you in
the shape of an enormous yellow eye An
impossibly low tone rumbles through the waters
around you shaking you to your core like an
organic war horn the size of a canyon The eye
narrows as the tone grows stronger A thought
enters your mind a jumble of emotions that your
brain attempts to make sense of until a word
Watching The eye just looks at you waiting expectantly
 Watching
 The eye opens a bit and leans closer towards
you Potential
 Learn
 Learn Grow Provoke Consume
 Reward
 Patience The eye closes and the light is
gone You feel the darkness and the cold
completely suffuse your entire world as the panic
and solitude the true quiet of your
unconsciousness begins to take hold At that
moment you gasp for breath and your eyes open
coughing and sputtering in the morning air If we
could have everybody else come back to the table
please Call them back in
 Watching potential learn grow provoke
consume Well go over the rest later Come on in
 Yes youre supposed to come back in
 You are
 Everybody back
 As the rest of you have already come to
consciousness in the morning air begun to situate
your belongings and put out the embers of the fire
that lasted pardon throughout the night Your
morning belches getting out Fjord has slept in
and has been ever so still in his sleep Suddenly
without warning he suddenly shoots up from his
sleep his eyes wide and as he opens his mouth
begins coughing and spitting water up
 No
 It was a sizeable glass filled with water
 Its briny and salty
 Yeah make an insight check
 Ive never been more proud of my wife
 Seems like hes covering some confusion or
at least trying to deflect
 As you glance down at your sheath on the
ground it is empty There is no falchion
 No
 You look down and its not in the sheath
You glance around its nowhere near you
 He looks down at his open palm and there is
a flash of greenishblue teal energy out of his
grip There clutched within his grasp you see
the falchion coated in the remnants of sea floor
life You see the barnacles encrusted around the
edge and up the back of the blade as it begins to
drip water The same kind that was coughed up by
Fjord this morning
 You watch as it just disappears out of your
grip
 You have to make a new one
 
 As far as you can tell as forthright and
honest as youve heard him be
 It probably had a few names in travel and
youve gone through a few horses
 So whatever you come up with
 Interesting point too
 For most of you
Winters Crest would have little meaning Its
largely celebrated in continents to the west as
it is specific to a historic event that did not
happen in Wildemount But youre a carnival so
you guys have more of a vast and strange knowledge
 When he says Winters Crest maybe Beau
 Its possible but just for a bit of
information
 As you guys look off at this conversation
with the horse the horse is currently about 
feet off in the field eating grass out of the
field
 As you guys gather up in the fresh morning
air back into the cart
 As Beau gets nice and swole for the
morning
  Vasquez is a pretty good print
I think we were talking Vasquez and Starbuck
from the new Battlestar are both good character
prints for Beau Yeah love that As you guys
bring the cart back up onto the Amber Road
northward you begin your secondday trek You
guys push on for a few hours Is it still Beau and
Mollymauk keeping point
 Ill have both of you roll a perception
check please
 Okay
 Calm fields
 You push on for a few more hours the
afternoon staring to get late You can choose
soon when it gets dark to set up camp again and
stay another evening out in the fields or you get
a sense looking at the map that you had procured
that if you push an extra hour or so past you
could probably make it to Alfield before the
nights done
 All righty You guys push forward kind of
pick up the pace a bit but the horse and those of
you who are on the sides of the cart if you wish
to you can jog along the side to alleviate some
of the burden
 Keeping an eye out
 Okay The sun does eventually close towards
the Cyrios Mountains to the west and night begins
to fall At this point you do see just over the
distance in the hill as darkness comes you can
see the faint glow a cluster of light of a
village in the distant hills You get the sense
that this is probably Alfield at the perimeter of
your vision As you continue to push forward
youve now gone past eight hours of continuous
travel into the ninth hour I would like you all
to roll a constitution saving throw please
 Nine as well Wow Its like Rammstein on
that side of the table

 All right So the three of you take one
level of exhaustion
 This is a good thing to look up
Essentially per point of exhaustion
 There you go So you have disadvantage on
ability checks until you take a long rest to get
rid of it
 Yes On ability checks so skills and things
like that
 All right You guys are youre a few
youre probably about a half mile away from
Alfield and it looks even at this distance a bit
smaller than Trostenwald where you were You can
see the faint clusters of trees on the north
eastern and northeastern sides of the city
otherwise its just in this pocket behind a few
hills Its a bit podunk in size you can gather
from this distance but its welcoming Theres a
flash of orange light on the outskirts of town
 No it just looked like a flash I mean it
could have been arcane Its hard to tell at this
distance its quite a ways away
 Theres a second one  You faintly
see what looks like the distant curl of flames
beginning to spread across what appears to be a
roof
 I mean as you sit here and watch
 You guys begin to go into a faster jog in
that direction As you do you can see the fire is
now beginning to consume a handful of buildings
and the flames are beginning to flicker higher
You begin to hear in the distance a very faint
highpitched yelp or some sort of a screech Its
hard to make it out at this distance its an open
field area and its mingling with what sounds like
now dozens of voices screaming and entwining As
you can see the uncontrolled flames still
progressing on the eastern side of the village
you can just see as you get within a few hundred
feet of the western side of Alfield people just
running Villagers probably a few hundred of
them are now just running out of the town as you
guys begin to approach Towards you and out into
the field So as youre approaching theyre
coming your direction
 As you glance over you see a family of five
halflings rushing right past you The mother is
dragging two of the younger ones by the hand while
the father is running alongside the eldest
daughter probably in her teens The father wears
a leather cap and has a handlebar mustache and
simple farm clothing As you shout out he makes
your eye contact
 Oh I dont know what happened They
started to burn the buildings and these things
started rushing The city is under attack
  Big things Dogfaced I cant
Come on They just keep running
 At this point you guys can see more people
are fleeing As you get closer about  feet
outside the city you watch as the droves of
people are beginning to get at least either the
ones that are actively fleeing have made it out of
the city or in the process the stragglers are still
coming through You see a young human man with
scrappy tattered brown hair a bit of blood
dripping down his face running before his back
arches and he falls into the grass You can see an
arrow protruding from his back At that point you
can see standing up from behind one of the
exterior walls of the city a humanoid creature
stretching up to about seven feet tall muscular
torso with thin doglike legs You watch as it
extends its neck with spots of fur its ears
curled upwards as it has a doglike snout at the
front of it
 You watch as it leaps onto the back of this
fallen villager bites into the shoulder and tears
a chunk out Swallows it before it growls into the
air 
 You have Youve encountered a roving band
of these on your way southward
 It swallows the flesh grabs the body and
then darts back into the city dragging the corpse
of the villager its just killed with it
rapidly
 No Theyre small and waist high and
shoulder high walls that are partitions here and
there but its largely a farming city
 No not at all
 No hes about well depends on the spell
Right now hes about  feet from you and hes
running into the city You can see the flames are
further in but you can see the orange glow
flickering in the distance
 Perception check
  In the immediate vicinity you do not
You see more people from the village starting to
run out screaming You see a handful of
crownsguard come out one of them looks wounded
and is To the north Where are they coming
from You see the two of them dart off northward
into the city What are you guys doing
 Okay
 No
 You get the sense at the moment theres no
active idea that these would be considered a
creature that would draw your attention
 Are you leaving the cart there on the
outskirts
 All right as you go charging into the city
youre pushing past fleeing villagers and you can
see some of the buildings now have been locked
shut You can see faintly through the windows
furniture being boarded up from the inside People
are hunkering down for whatever this assault is
As you enter you see the crownsguard went
northward but the one creature that you saw charge
in went straight towards the heart Right now you
can see theres two main streets that bisect this
small village Theres one that goes at an angle
northwest to southeast One that goes right
towards the center west to east As you head
towards the center you can see the flames are more
near that central square As you guys begin to
run push past a few more people the smoke is
starting to billow up and you can see now theres
embers rising and then falling This very faint
ashy rain of small points of reddishorange light
that begin to fall with the ash As you turn
around one of the buildings theres one of the
side walls and four crownsguard all ducked down
behind the wall with crossbows and longbows all
back behind it You can see one thats adorned
with more ornate armor You see a person there
with elven features but hint at a mixed
lineage They have their helmet on the ground
showing shoulderlength blond hair thats turned
red in places from a spattering of gore Through
gritted teeth they curse in pain as the bandages
are applied to what you can see is a wound right
around the midsection in the thigh area Another
soldier is in the process of wrapping it You
watch as they go Gah You fool bind the wound
dont stuff it Goes and they pull a bolt back
into the crossbow and nock it at the ready
Glancing up and seeing you approach they scan
past you most of you now with weapons at the
ready it seems charging forward You You
suddenly have an array of arrows about five or
six come over the wall One of them manages to
pierce the back of one of the crownsguards heads
and falls and crumples to the ground They all get
lower again You hear in the distance 
The individual looks back to you You are
you ablebodied
 And youre armed
  gold a gnoll ear Now get in there and
help
 They give you a look like Just go
  Two of them glace up and fire two
crossbow bolts over the wall and duck back behind
You hear a heavy smashing of wood some more barks
and gibbering echoing around the way You can see
now flames curling up to the top of the building
that youre all right next to before the small
wall that bisects the entryway
 Correct
 To give you perspective now
 You guys
 You are all right over this side area
corner Arrange yourself as you feel you wish to
be Over there on the far end of the village
 If you wish to you can place yourselves
where you wish or show me where you want them to go
 Right here
 With what little bit youve looked over to
the side you can see there are some up on the
rooftops in the distance You can see their dark
figures silhouetted by flames and other bits of
light that normally fill the streets in the center
of the city Most you can see are these up here and
you can already see a few bodies of guards and
civilians that are lying on the ground carved
open and not moving You see spatters of blood
You still hear them barking and giving orders next
to each other 
 Over here At this distance its hard to
say Id say probably in the neighborhood of about
 to  feet from you You guys I would like if
you are trying to stay out of sight make a
stealth check please Those of you with a point
of exhaustion you have disadvantage
 Thats okay As a group for the moment you
guys havent drawn their attention Youre still
right next to where there are crownsguard who are
in the process of a firefight with whatever is in
this vicinity of the city However you may or may
not make it through for the moment unseen Youre
not certain how many there are But you can hear a
lot of yipping and growling right around this
large twostory building that is currently
engulfed in flames
 You may youre stealthed currently
 Interesting point of order youre not too
certain of the gender of this individual kind of fluid
 There you go As the figure leaps over the
wall and begins making a run towards the center
area about four different arrows pass through its
form before one of these gnoll creatures goes
lumbering forward and slashes out to it This
gnoll interestingly enough the other ones you
see and the one you saw before the city are all
built and muscular This one seems to be porous
With a brief bit of view you can see theres
clumps of fur and exposed bone and part of its
skull is just pushing out of its snout with teeth
gnashing As it tears into the illusion it claws
through confused and looks over in your direction
As youre finishing drawing your blade across your
back what normally would be cold energy suddenly
flickers into this beacon of bright white light
 Something clicks in your mind and youre
like Oh I know you
 This entity would be here now It would have
just left out into that section there
 It does now
 All right
 You may Im giving you all one round
preparation before we roll initiative
 Okay Is that concentration
 All right Im going to put a concentration
marker on you just so we remember it
 Thats cool So thats you Thats you
Youre going to Vicious Mockery
 He rolled a  minus three I believe its
wisdom correct
 Im pretty sure thats a ten and that does
not make your DC
 Yes
 You drag the other edge of your blade
 Youve taken a total of six damage and your
max HP is down by six But you have currently the
new invoked Rite on each blade
 You may
 You may do that Where are you going to cast
it
 You watch as this flash of purplish energy
suddenly apparates into the air This thicklike
wooden handle that is jammed into a massive
bludgeoning solid piece of sugary goodness
 With that you can make an attack with that
as soon as it comes out Make a melee spell
attack please
  does hit
 Seven radiant damage nice As it strikes
down wham From the creature already watching
its bones and its form shakes
 Ten Oh thatll be enough You watch as it
pulls back with the Infernal shouting of Mollymauk
causing it to prepare itself for a lunge As it
gets low its jaw snapping open you watch as bits
of its skin fall onto the ground as it does so
 And right before it leaps  it just
smashes it into the ground and its bones go flying
and scattering in every which direction
 All right so Beau what are you doing You
all have one round of prep Right now youve gone
 You can move yeah
 Okay
 Okay Youre running that way
 All right And you send your duplicate over
there as well
 All righty And Beau
 Sure Easy to see in this perspective You
glance inside
 All right As you glance inside you can
just barely see around the corner The place is
tossed It is shattered and ruined It looks like
it was once the interior of a small tavern of some
kind but the kitchen is wrecked and you can see
two of these gnolls are in the process of grabbing
large sacks out of the kitchen and pulling them
out through the front door on the opposite side of
the building
 I would like you all now to roll
initiative
 Yes so these are with disadvantage
 It is
  to  anybody
  to 
  All righty  to ten
 All right ten to five
 Okay so that order
 Molly then Jester Then Caleb
 All righty so Top of the round as some of
this has happened The one gnoll skeletal form has
shattered onto the ground Some of the other
gnolls begin to look over in that direction and
see a few of you over by the guards now standing
up and darting over the way Theyre preparing for
some sort of whatevers coming But first of the
round is you Beau
 Okay
 Make a performance check
 All right The whistle has a bit of volume
to it Unfortunately with the sound of all the
breaking of furniture them all growling at each
other and the general screams in the vicinity
its lost in the chaos Its not necessarily a
quiet atmosphere to draw a guards attention The
gnolls dont seem to care much for a whistle
around the window Theyre more focused on
grabbing and running out the front other way
with whatever theyre taking
 Ill let that be like a bonus action well
say
 Because you were waiting for something to
happen
 Okay With a foot movement that brings
you
 You do As you go through the window
because theyve mostly shifted into the other room
now thats where you see them moving Theyre not
in the room thats closest to you so you go jump
through the window over the mass make your way
through the living room and you watch as theyre
exiting the door You get all the way through
 Unfortunately no But you do manage to make
it all the way to this door there
 Nope
 Is that still what you want to do
 Well heres what you do As you rush
through to go after them as theyre fleeing out
the other side you come to the doorway and you
can see theres one gnoll right in front of you
that hasnt noticed you rushing behind it Its
currently throwing a corpse of one of the
villagers onto a cart thats sitting right outside
of that door That cart which is piled up with
other corpses and bags and whatever things they
were robbing from the inside of this building that
theyve thrown onto this cart You can now see
theres four gnolls that are gathered around it in
the process of throwing things onto it and it
looks like theyre getting ready to start pushing
it They havent noticed your arrival as youve
just darted into the doorway What are you going
to do
 No that was your move to get there
 Well as your action you can just go into it
without having to spend a ki point
 Because you already used your bonus action
The ki point allows you to do it as a bonus
action but you can just do it as an action any
time
 You just go into the dodge action
 Right so youre holding back in the
doorway and youre ready to use the door to help
defend you if it needs to Okay that ends Beaus
turn Its now their turn
 They rolled really high in the initiative
 Visibly off to the side there is
 Yeah thats going to be two of them firing
their bow Actually no three because they
watched you come out Theres three of them that
are going to be firing their bows at Beau
 They all have disadvantage on the attack
however
 As this one fires off in the direction of
your duplicitous form as it disappears through
As its the only thing it can visually see Its
going to stay behind the wall Thats three
attacks at disadvantage against Beau
 They do
 First one with a longbow thats a 
 Right Misses The first one you watch as
it just moves past you and slams into the door
The next one from this guy up here
 Thats a  and a two The other one misses
into the wall This one over here is going to fire
at you Thats a  and a  plus three 
 The first two
 one hits the door the other
one you duck out of the way and the third one
comes and its piercing right towards your chest
Its going to deal d seven points of piercing damage
 Oh right Because you got that for your
Okay As a reaction you watch this one arrow that
you cant quite duck out of the way
 All right So go ahead and make the roll
 Yeah youre trying to swat it and see if
you can carry the momentum with it
 You reduce the damage to zero and you catch
it
 If you want to you can spend a ki point to
throw it if you want to
 All right where are you throwing it to
 Okay
 All right so as you grab it you spin
around and throw it Go ahead and make the attack roll
 It should be your
 I know This is new
 Here we go You just make a ranged attack
with it so roll a d add your dexterity modifier
and your proficiency modifier so same as any of
your other attacks because it counts as a monk weapon
  hits It takes d so roll d plus
two
 All right I wonder does it add your damage
bonus to it or the original weapon because it is
your strength throwing it back Pardon me folks
while were figuring out new abilities they can use
 It is your attack so you get to add your
dex bonus
 All right so six points of damage You
watch as the arrow just sinks into the chest of
its thick hide armor 
 The other ones that are throwing stuff onto
the cart hear this commotion and turn around and
look at you Three of them continue just throwing
stuff onto the cart faster while the one thats
immediately in front of you spins around and
stands tall You can see it looking down at you a full
foot and a half almost two feet taller than you
 Its going to go ahead and grabs a
spear off the side of the wall that it had leaning
against and its going to try to thrust it at you
It still has disadvantage on the attack though
because youre in your stance Thats 
 This one as it goes and thrusts with the
spear coming off of the adrenaline of the
deflected missile you duck low and then kick the
spear up which slams into the top of the door frame
and completely misses you Hes now stepping into
the door frame completely filling it as youre
backing up into your space and the two of you are
in this very intense small occupied block
 These guys are going to begin pushing the
cart and its going to move at half their movement
to there This one here is going to move up to
here right around the side of this wall and its
going to take its longbow and fire at you
because youre the one they can see
 Disadvantage That is a 
 This one actually you see over at the
fire and you grab the front of the armor of the
gnoll and pull his in front of you and it actually
hits the back of his armor splintering it and
the smell hits you
 As you let him go theres this thick oily
horrible liquid thats matted in the fur and the
touch of its nasty The smell itself is very
acrid of rotting flesh and mangy fur Thats going
to end all those guys there theyre pushing
there All right that ends the gnolls turn
Fjord youre up
 Thats exactly where you can get
 Correct You see it has a longbow and is
currently reaching back and its pulling another
arrow and getting it notched up
 All righty so whats the save on that one
 No thats an eight Im pretty sure that
does not hit
 Thats concentration correct
 Im putting a concentration circle on you
All righty the charmed target must use its action
before moving each of its turns to make a melee
attack against a creature other than itself you
mentally choose So it has to be a melee attack
 Thats okay

 That you can
 Okay Since it has to use its action before
its movement you watch as it looks up at the top
of the roof  and leaps up climbs
scampers up to the side and gets right up into
base to base with this guy confusing the other
gnoll who looks down at it like its about to
help him and it doesnt seem to notice theres
any sort of threat there but it cant make an
attack on this round
 Well theyre medium theyre not
 Its cutting it close youd look like a
small gnoll
 You are visible to a number of gnolls in
this courtyard You dont have any movement to
back away from that edge unfortunately
 Right but youre right on the corner
thats how you were able to see him and send him
this way
 Yeah they can both see you Just so you
know The rest of them probably cant but you
transform yourself into a gnolllike appearance
All right Does that end your turn
 All righty In the back of the alleyway one
of the gnolls stands thicker more angry and more
ornate than the rest of the pack You see heavy
scale mail armor across the torso and a large
helmet across its head You look as thick spines
about a foot and a half to two feet long are woven
into the scales themselves off the shoulders the
back of the helmet and the sides of the armor
They look natural as opposed to metal like long
bony spines that are put onto it both as an
ornate adornment or possibly just a means of
defense and to look scary It begins barking and
steps forward giving motions to some of the other
gnolls and the ones that are on the cart continue
pushing it as it steps forward
 To there
 Its going to go ahead and use
 Its going to use Incite Rampage
 It looks over towards the one thats right
next to Beau and goes  The one thats
in the middle of the area with you hears that
grins and then gets an extra attack against you
with disadvantage And a four That defense is
helping you out It goes to strike again and as
it comes out with its claw its putting its spear
to the side
 It misses you entirely Thats going to end
its turn at the moment Then it goes to the guards
on this end These guards are going to fan out
 Then they dart back around this way Theyre
going to find a corner next to you Jester and
take a shot at the gnoll thats up on the roof
next to the one that you have charmed Shit
thats going to miss Five plus five He fires and
it goes wide you see it vanish into the rising
cloud of embers and flame Thats going to end the
guards turn Theyre getting around and preparing
for the next round to shoot a volley
 They glance over their shoulder and is like
Shh Molly youre up
 This way
  It will put you at about there
 But thats your round
 Cool All righty That ends Mollys turn
Jester youre up
 Over here
 That space
 Okay Thats your turn You still have an
action
 You currently cannot see anything for it to
attack You need to be able to see a target for it
to attack something So youd have to be either
further out You can do it as part of your
movement as you run across make it move and
attack and then continue back
 Can you move it  feet
 Which direction
 Make a roll
  unfortunately does not hit
 It just misses you watch as the shield
comes up and deflects the large glowing mace of a
lollipop Then you continue the rest of your
movement to dart behind the building At this
point youve all pretty much shown your cards
that youre here and part of this fight Youre
the only one whos up in the air
 Correct
 Well you would be able to as youre
running
 Against
 These would be things you would have done before you
ran across
 Just letting you know that usually you have
to do that as part of your movement Dexterity
saving throw That is a 
 It takes d points of radiant damage
 After the shield deflects the lollipop the
flash of radiant energy burns across the armor and
the torso Instinctively it puts up the shield to
try and deflect the blow from the eyes
 Looks out and doesnt see where it
came from but its singed a little That ends
Jesters turn Caleb and Nott youre up
 The big one You do
  hits
 All three hit
  points of fire damage As the three beams
arc out and blast you see as the large gnoll who
seems to be a pack lord or leader of some kind
sees this coming Tries to put the shield up but
all three blast into its armor You watch as
flames burn out of it suddenly As it withdraws
and takes a step back  It just
looks angry It looks hurt a little bit but
mostly angry
 Okay
 Good to know
 Nott youre up
  that doesnt oh wait for a regular
gnoll that just hits barely

 Well its your level right You went up a
level so technically
  points of damage As this gnoll is in the
process of slamming through the front doorway the
doorway has been bashed inward on each side and
Beau is in the process of dodging and weaving and
getting out of the way You find one opening and
fire your crossbow bolt It goes through the
window through the doorway bisecting the two
different rooms and straight under the clavicle
near the heart section of it As it pierces in
 and it coughs up a bunch of blood onto
the front of its hide armor Its not dead but
its pretty hurt That was a pretty nasty blow
 Go ahead and make an athletics check
 Ten is exactly what you needed That was the
DC to get up onto the second floor As you come up
into the second floor you immediately climb and
leap up through the window into a chamber that is
filled with roaring flame
 Trying to avert your gaze the heat is
pressing into you Theres a table thats on fire
most of the roof has been burned away Theres
beams that have fallen Youre like This was a
bad idea
 No that was your movement to get up there
and you could use your bonus action if youd like to
 Its still burning but youre going to have
to leap over the flames to get there
 Ill say make an acrobatics check to try and
leap over parts of broken
 You make it across You leap onto the first
beam and it breaks Youre like Ah that burns
You leap again onto the next one Ah that burns
too Eventually you get over there Your boots
are on fire and youre having to pat them out
real fast You suffer five points of fire damage
getting across the room
 But you are in an area where it seems its
just embers and most of the flame is catching
behind you for the moment You get the sense that
it might begin to spread in the next minute or so
but at this point youre not immediately in the
threat of flame and you have a look down into the
entirety of the courtyard with a little bit of
cover In fact it would be considered half cover
up in here
 At which point you can see the skeletal
gnolls that are out there all at once turn and
begin shambling forward Theres one this way that
begins to run up and take a swing at your
duplicitous form before striking out with no
effect This one spins and comes up into Beau and
then theres one that emerges from
 Thats okay we learn what the new abilities
do
 Thats all good
 Out of the doorway here another one of them
bursts through and runs to the back and sees the
direction where Jester is in the process of
glancing over to the side
 It uses its action to charge up into combat
with you It cant actually make an attack this
turn but its right up to you Its gaping
vacuous skull open sockets trying to bear down
on you Thats going to end their go except for
the one thats striking at you Beau
 Well thats not one of the skeletal ones
Thats going to be with disadvantage  to hit
  hit It bites out towards you with its
broken toothy jaws and you suffer six points of
piercing damage as the jaws clamp down on your
forearm and youre like Oh god Its pushing now
to try to find the space next to the larger gnoll
and theyre both currently blocking the doorway
from your escape
 Which by the way top of the round Beau
your go
 Awesome go ahead and roll for your main
attack
 You pull it out Theres a horrible pained
yelp as you yank it out As you spin around and
attempt to slam it into its back its giant thick
gnoll arm slams into the door frame and blocks
your ability to pass forward You get caught over
its arm and have to withdraw
 The one that just bit you All right go for
it
   doesnt hit unfortunately Lot of
whiffing on both sides when it comes around Beau
but as you attempt to strike out with the elbow
it does strike its skull and its jaw unhinges and
snaps it back into place
 Yep
 As a bonus action you can use a ki point to
do two as your bonus if you have it Flurry of Blows
 No you used your bonus action sorry You
want to move or you want to stay where you are
 The door frame is pretty banged up you can
try You can certainly try
 Taking a step back one has spears so
youre still in its melee range as you try and
close the door Theyll both get attacks of
opportunity on you if you do that
 Okay so you stay there holding your
position That ends Beaus turn The gnolls go
Before we do anything the one thats right next
to the guy on the wall what do you want it to do
 He has a spear or you can make a shove up
to you
 All right so the spear attack its going
to as it climbs to the top and lunges out with
its arm Go ahead and make an attack roll for me
 It is plus five
 Sorry plus four
  definitely hits Go ahead and roll d
damage plus two Two hands technically so that
would be d Sorry
 Nine Nein It jams the spear with both hands into
its friend and the gnoll yelps and grabs it and
pulls it out and looks at it confused and angry
Trying to figure out what exactly happened As it
does so its going to attempt to shove it off the
wall that just hit it Make a roll for the
athletics check of the other gnoll
 Its modifier
  plus two It beat it It rolled a 
After it gets stabbed and looks back at the gnoll
that you took control and Spartakicks it off of
the edge of the roof It slides and tumbles down
landing onto the ground prone right next to Molly
It does suffer one point of falling damage Molly
you watch as it tumbles and hits the dirt next to
you and its like  You watch as this
mystical crown of weird iron horns are floating
above its head
 That takes up his turn This guys going to
move forward and advance This is unfortunate for
Beau partially This one is going to fire at
Beau This one actually can see Nott and this one
is going to take a shot at Nott as well So one
attack against you Beau from that gnoll there
Thats going to be  misses It actually hits
the wall and embeds itself into the side of the
door frame The two attacking you Nott You do
have partial cover on these guys Half cover will
be plus two bonus to AC The first one is going to be a

 The second one is a natural two The one
that does hit you you suffer nine points of
piercing damage A lot of nines tonight As the
arrow suddenly arcs upward and hits you right in
the side of the jaw and carves through part of
your neck that way before it exits out the other
side You have this big gash on the side It
doesnt quite hit the jugular thankfully but it
is pretty messy as you are starting to bleed down
the side of your neck
 Yeah but that one had some decent aim
These guys here continue to push forward that way
and theyre going to use their other action to
push forward This guy is going to go ahead and
throw another body up onto this as the other ones
pushing it They dont get quite as far because
one of them stopped pushing but theyre getting
to the edge of the map The one thats snarling
there is watching them vanish behind This guy
around the edge is going to lets see Seeing you
yelp up in the window hes going to take a shot
at you Beaus currently being dealt with two of
them and youre up in the flames right now That
is going to be a  which I do not believe hits
 This one strikes the ember wood on the
outside and breaks through but it only comes
partially out and is embedded missing you by an
inch That finishes the gnolls turn I believe
Oh this guy is going to turn and take a swing at
Beau with a spear two hands That is a 
  misses It swings out and you actually
catch the spear off to the side and youre now in
a strength tug of war with its own weapon as
its
 Ending their go it goes to Fjords turn
 Let me doublecheck something
 I dont know if thats the case Its not
just that It already moved on its turn it takes
its turn you have to spend your action to maintain
the spell so it wont do anything on your turn
So either you continue to maintain the spell and
then next turn its still under your control or
you do whatever you want
 Oh thats right Thank you
 Yes you do
 All righty are you holding your action to
do anything
 You have your action because you didnt
maintain the spell
 This guy
 I believe its a bonus action to do that
isnt it
 So you still have your action
 Go for it make the attack roll
 That hits go ahead and roll damage
  points of damage As you rush up you
watch as this squatter gnoll saunters out in the
middle points to the seeming leader of this
cluster and as it does the soot and ash from the
ground begins to affix itself around the inside of
its armor holding it in place for the moment
With the other hand holding the suddenly
appearing barnaclestudded blade you unleash
this blast of eldritch energy that slams into the
center of the armor You watch as the energy
courses through all of the crevices between the
scales that are overlapping As it fades you
watch as this bit of steam and blood come out of
its mouth and it turns right to you its head
turning it spits a cluster
 Well get to that Thats your turn
 Okay its his turn now Now it shrieks
and growls

 And goes running and rushes up towards you
You watch as previously it just had this large
pole on its back It pulls it and brings it loose
as you see a large twohanded glaive come swooping
which doesnt actually it can get to there and
still hit you because of its reach As it runs
forward it brings it down Its going to
multiattack you twice with it
 First one is going to be a  to hit
 And a  to hit
 Both hit All right
 That is eight points of slashing damage on
the first hit Wham As the large polearm the
axelike hooked blade at the end of it You can
see the same spines that are on its armor are
affixed to the edge of it As it slams down
towards you the armor bursts this cold energy
that how much damage does he take
 Slick Second strike He rolled a one That
is going to be four points of slashing damage for
the second strike
 Nice
 Oh He does get back his Incite Rampage At
which point hes going to go ahead and glance
over towards the gnoll that is hmm
 The grassy gnoll yes Thank you Sam
 All right yeah The only one that they can
currently see thats in melee range at the moment
because the walls there is going to be the one
next to Beau
 Sincerely So after it strikes you twice
with the glaive bits of ice shards spray off with
each blow now affixing to the ash and the energy
thats instilled this armor after you blasted it
It looks over to the one right in front of Beau
and goes  and it glances over
its shoulder and with renewed strength pulls the
spear free from your grasp and goes for another
strike against you as a reaction
 That is going to be a  to hit
 
 Two
 Thats going to be seven points of piercing
damage
 All righty thats going to end his turn and
the guards back here are going to come forward and
 Theyre both going to fire at the one on the
rooftop
 First ones a miss Second one is a  That
hits
 Its an eight plus two so thats ten points
of damage Based on the Crown of Madness damage it
took earlier the spears enough to finish it
off You watch as on the top it goes and draws an
arrow and pulls it back looking down at you as
youre down in the square Then one of the guards
pulls its crossbow and  it stumbles back
and falls dead on the ground
 That ends that one the other guard over
there Theyre going to go ahead and move up the
side and step out now that it seems to be opening
and is going to fire towards the skeletal gnoll
that is currently in the process of harassing the
image that as far as theyre concerned is just
Jester Its going to be yeah that hits
Without issue
 Pulls out the heavy crossbow and fires and
does  points of damage which is enough to
shatter the skeletal gnoll witherling As it falls
to the ground and breaks into a scattered pile of
bone bits and dried gnoll flesh That ends the
guards turn Molly youre up
 It is prone so I believe you have advantage
against it Yep With each attack
 Wisdom bonus is against undead creatures
 It is not There are undead creatures
among the pack but there are none there Its just
straight Rite damage
  unfortunately misses The first strike
 As you swing down onto the ground it
scrambles about and pulls its shield up just in
time Your blade catches the edge embeds itself
an inch into its rear
 You use your one blade to push the shield
off to the side as its still there and trying to
jam downward Go for it
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Nine points of damage You manage to jam
underneath and hit it in the chest It shrieks with pain
and pushes the blade out of its body with a sheer
flexing of its muscle It begins to try and get up
off the ground Its hurt but its still standing or about
to be standing in a moment You can move if youd
like to
 It does get an attack of opportunity but it
has disadvantage on him
 Onto the wall
 You could
 You get up onto the wall
 Cool thats fine Molly your turn is over
Jester youre up
 This way
 As you rush out it takes a swing attack of
opportunity towards you This is going to be with
a club It has a heavy wooden club and it makes a
giant arc towards you as you speed away That is
 to hit
 You can yeah
 All right Well first the club hits you
and you take five points of bludgeoning damage
 As you turn around you say that at him and
unleash your Hellish Rebuke He has to make a
constitution saving throw I believe it is
right
 It has to make a constitution save No
thats dexterity saving throw which it does not
make Its seven So it suffers d cold damage So how
much did you deal
 As you dart away you release your fury and
anger and you watch as suddenly this blast of cold
water and ice energy burst out of its body The
inside of its somewhat cavernous ribcage is now
filled with frost crystals jutting out and
breaking parts of the ribs It looks heavily
damaged but still standing
 All righty
 Yeah
 Okay
 All right Go ahead and make your spell attack
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Whats up with the nines Its getting
ridiculous
 Yep
 All right Guiding Bolt
 the next attack
against it has advantage
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage for Spiritual
Weapon
 This is absurd guys This is absurd All
righty does that end your turn
 Youre from over there thats 
 you have ten more feet You can get there
 Oh the brick wall Youll get up onto it
 Its considered rough terrain so you
technically cant get all the way on the other
side You climb up onto it That finishes your
turn As you finish blasting with the Guiding
Bolt at the same time as it slams and sparkles
you watch as the lollipop clubs down onto the
back of its head That ends your turn Caleb
Nott youre up
 Go ahead and make the attack roll
 It spins and hits the ground You watch as
ice crawls up the side of the building I will say
it does manage to put out part of the fire that is
currently burning the building
 As you move out where are you at now
 You dart out and fire and then back All
righty That ends your turn Nott
 There are currently three that are gathered
around it and in the process of pushing it
Theyre getting momentum as its going
 Make a perception check It will take your
bonus action to do so
 As you dig in and hang down you watch as
your hood and hair hangs upside down You pull the
crossbow down The tension of the bolt is holding
it in thankfully otherwise it would just fall
from its upside down standpoint and you
fire You can go ahead and make a strike
Technically you have two that youre in view of
here they both have threequarters cover because
of the nearby door and the angle
 Yeah
 Which one are you shooting The skeletal one
or the
 Okay so that one Go for it
  would hit if it didnt have
threequarters cover which gives a plus five bonus
to AC
 Unfortunately its just the large part of
the door frame in the way theres Beau in the
way and theres a lot going on in that moment As
you go and fire it just zips past and slams into
part of the now broken door thats coming off the
hinges
 All righty Go ahead and make a stealth
check
 You get down low but your hood and hair are
now frizzed and poking out the side That ends
your turn Nott This one is going to rush
forward pursuing Jester That one is going to
attempt to continue to whale on Beau Thats going
to be a  against Beau
 Misses you just duck out of the way as it
tries to bite you and slam your elbow onto its
snout knocking it out of the way Just holding
on holding off in this doorway The one that runs
up towards you is going to attempt to hit you
again with a club That is going to be a  Again
 Oh thats a d sorry Thats six points of
bludgeoning damage Whack As the club hits you in
the back of the head as youre just climbing over
the top of the wall You have to catch yourself
from tumbling face first into the dirt on the
other side You manage to catch your footing on
top of the wall But its now up and in
combat with both you and the guard from earlier
That ends their turn Top of the round Beau
youre up
 The skeletal one Theres a skeletal one
and theres the one thats been fighting you this
whole time
 The skeletal one hasnt been damaged yet
but it looks a little more fragile The one that
got shot by Nott earlier still has the big
 Go for it Do the attack
 That hits Doesnt have as strong an armor class
as the other one
 Eight points of damage That ones already
been damaged previously As you bring the staff
down with both hands whack you slam right
through the center of its chest and clavicle You
watch as the torso breaks and folds from the
weight of the blow The skull tumbles off and hits
the ground and it falls into a pile of bones and
rags
 Go for it Single attack
 All right so this is your third ki point
 Right because you did the No because you
did flurry earlier didnt you
 No a Flurry of Blows I thought
 You did the dodge action as an action
which doesnt take any ki points You spent one
doing a Flurry of Blows earlier
 This is your third one
 Im sorry thats what I was asking my
confusion Cool so go for it
 Ten against him Nope As you kick both feet
forward one hits and skims off the shoulder The other
  just hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Seven points of damage All righty based on
the damage that you had sustained earlier and the
blows from earlier as you strike him with the
other foot you snap the side of his jaw which
breaks out As he stumbles backward you take the
back of the staff and crack up underneath the jaw
snapping the neck the rest of the way and it
falls to the ground no longer moving You still
have your movement
 With that this gnoll is going to stand up
Mollys on the wall
 Its okay Stands up
 Thats more because these walls are not the
most sturdy There you go Stands up to you This
one is going to step forward into the way This
one is going to join in there Those three now in
visual range These two are both going to take
shots at Jester This ones going to take a shot
at Fjord Two longbows aiming in your direction
Thats a  and a natural one The second one
misses You suffer eight points of piercing damage
as the arrow sinks right into your torso right in
the stomach area and pierces through You catch
it with your hand but its still a few inches
into your actual midsection Then theres the one
over here that turned around and sees you now
engaging with the current pack leader
 Thats a 
 Thats going to be six points of piercing
damage This one now slams into the side of your
knee and hits the meaty part so thankfully its
not locked in the bone or any of the joint but it
hits you in the side and you buckle to that side
from the pain
 This guy over here is going to leap down and
begin helping push the cart
 With that the cart pushes another full 
feet and is currently off of the board Let me
mark it over here
 That finishes the gnolls turn there Oh
theres the one thats attacking Molly Its going
to take its spear and attempt to twohand strike
at you That is cocked
  to hit which I dont think hits
 You on the wall dance off the way leap as
it goes up All right and I believe thats all
the gnolls immediately in the vicinity that are in
combat That ends the gnolls turn Fjord youre up
 Youre still within his attack range
because he has the glaive You do have
disadvantage on Eldritch Blast
 Right there
 You pull back to the corner there As you
pull back he takes a step forward and reaches out
with the glaive to try and strike you
 Nope That is a  to hit
 That is going to be ten points of slashing
damage As you back away arcs downward
  does not hit Now that its seen the
Blast after it strikes and grins you hear this
 under its breath You turn around
and go to strike out with the Eldritch Blast and
it pulls one of the other gnolls nearby and yanks
it in front of him just as the shield takes it
off then sets him back in place Deflects it with
its own guy
 You dont have to spend a bonus action you
just drop it Pulling back from the fire yeah
you can get just around that corner The guard
lets you by
 That ends your turn The leader at this
point makes this loud gibbering sound that echoes
throughout the alley turns and runs off to
pursue the cart
 That ends his turn The guards now who have
notched their crossbows again are going to take
shots at both of those guys right there Fucking
two That does hit The other one gets hit
 Molly youre up
 You do not He is not prone anymore
unfortunately
 Ten does not hit unfortunately
  will hit Go ahead and roll damage
 Radiant All right The first one you swing
and it ducks out of the way and attempts to
strike upward with its spear As you do you knock
it to the side with the scimitar that missed and
with your other hand strike down right across its
face You arc through and you actually carve one
of the eyes in twain You see a large red mark
where youve split part of its face and its hurt
really bad but its still standing Theres gore
dripping out of the socket where its ruined eye
sits 
 You can do that without a problem You
leapfrog off of him grab his shoulders and land
behind him scimitars at the ready Okay ending
Mollys turn Jester youre up
 The guards already went Oh she didnt
fire Sorry thank you for reminding me about
that The other guards did go she did not They
did not
 They throw their crossbow to the ground and
pull out a morningstar and does a sideswipe
towards this That is a  Well say that
straight up hits That does five plus eight points
of damage to that one I dont think youve
damaged that one yet right
 Thats right you did That was the wrong
one All right with that they swing backwards
with the mace and hit the side of the skeletal
head which shatters immediately upon impact
ruining its form and is no longer part of the
battle
 You are You tumble that way
 All righty Jester your turn
 From what you can tell nope
 Go for it
 As it swings in the air and spins they both
take one step back and it hits the dirt and they
both look at each other and 
 There you go All righty That ends Jesters
turn Caleb Nott youre up
 Yes over here
 That ones probably the easiest to see right
now
 That definitely hits
 As it bursts into it you see the fur burn
and singe and  pats it out and the
flames subside you see its charred and burnt
and you see the flesh is cracked and blackened
Its injured but its standing
 That ends your turn Nott
 You can see those down there The one just
got blasted with the familiar fiery explosion of
Calebs Chromatic Orb The other is untouched
 Wisdom saving throw That is a natural 
What is your spell DC
  All right
 Did you shoot the one who was blasted with
the fire or the one that was untouched
 You watch as the one that was currently
untouched that was drawing another arrow glances
up and hears and goes 
and falls to the ground  Laughing
this horrible hyena chuckle and its billowing
out into the street clutching its stomach and
dropping its weapons to the side and just rolling
on the ground Its friend next to it is like huh
Looks up and sees you
 Go for it
 Okay That ends your turn There are no more
of the undead types so theyre off the thing
Beau youre up
 Thats five feet of movement
 As soon as he glances over to the side he
looks back just as youre already in his face
  thatll definitely hit Roll damage
  points of damage Whack You watch as
about five or six gnoll teeth go flying from the
impact the jaw quivers as spittle and blood goes
careening off the side of the impact It falls and
stumbles if you want to follow it up
 Go for it
 That hits go ahead and roll damage
 Right so its a d for this one but were
using the staff for a flourish
 Eight points of damage Wham As you bring
it down over the top of the head it falls and
gets up its dazed and beaten within an inch of
its life its ready to go Its barely standing
at this point one eye is lolling around and
trying to find and the other one is swollen shut
now and cant actually see anything Its in a bad
place
 Okay That ends your turn Beau The guy on
the ground is just laughing his ass off At the
end of its turn its going to try and make a
saving throw No that is a two It is still
laughing on the ground This one seeing the rest
of its allies run turns around and is just going
to run
 This one seeing another one flee is going
to attempt to try and flee after You get an
attack of opportunity
 You do not
 That hits roll damage
 Yes
 You knock and crush him to the floor As he
tries to run you whack and hit him and you watch
him take a few steps and skid and fall onto the
ground and hes not moving The one over here
who is not currently in the process of knowing
that everyone else is fleeing because hes been
stuck over here is going to try to take a spear
attack at you Molly
 Which is good because he rolled a natural
 on the first roll
 Disadvantage that brings him to a 
 So it just hits you
 Eight points of piercing damage Its eyes go
dark and it pulls back and still it seems its
sense of smell can still find your placement in
the vicinity and as you pull out of the way it
still manages to find you The spear pierces right
around where the hip is and you pull back
gritting your teeth Thats going to end its go
 Yep
 All right it has disadvantage against it
because its prone
  As its rolling around on the ground
its difficult to find a proper shot and you
fire and it hits the dirt next to it sending a
bit of dust over it It stops laughing for a
second as the dust He laughs even harder at the
actual dust
 That ends your turn All right The guards
go The leader continues to run and is now
disappearing into the smoke and ash You dont
have a visual on the cart at the moment its now
pressed into where a lot of the fire is and its
obscuring their escape These guards are going to
move forward as they load their crossbows and
theyre both actually because hes on the
ground laughing youre coming out on the roof
theyre going to turn and fire at the one thats
in front of Molly It does have threequarters
cover because of the wall Theyre trying to help
you out
 Hits the wall and deflects
 That does hit That is a  actually so
that does even with the bonus to armor class from
the threequarters cover it still hits
 With that as its there in front of you
with its spear after stabbing you it pulls back
and one crossbow bolt out of its forehead 
Its jaw goes slack and falls to the ground dead
 Well theres still one left on the ground
which well say for the purposes of narrative
here who wants to do this
 Well when we come back around it would be
Mollys turn Jester then Caleb and Nott So
whatever you guys want to do in this moment before
it comes back let me know
 Make an acrobatics check
 You jump off the side and you land you do
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you
hit the ground and your feet buckle and you
actually slam and your face hits the dirt but you
use your momentum to scurry back up and beginning
to move forward you get and if youre using the
rest of your
 I need you to make a concentration check by
the way
 Make a constitution saving throw because
you did take
 Yeah so you maintain control over the
Hideous Laughter Okay You rush into the cloud of
ash after them and you begin to see some of the
shapes ahead of you of the gnolls there pushing
the cart Youre still behind them by about  or
so feet and right as you rush forward darting
in the heat from the embers entering your lungs
burn and you put your mask over to block and help
filter a bit with the cloth and bandages and
right as you rush forward you see the back of
the heavy armored leader thats bringing up the
rear of where the cart is and he turns and sees you
 As soon as you finish your movement it
spins and looks in your vicinity to see that
youre alone
 Takes his glaive
 And closes the distance with a giant
downward swing
 At this point The narrative timing on
this
 Well Notts after you
 All right cool All right well lets roll
it back a little bit here and see how this helps
you All right cool So No its fine So
Jester Molly what are you guys doing
 Okay As you sprint off with a full dash
you dont quite get as close as Nott does
 Because Nott is much faster
 No
 Its not really a spider sense
 Youre about that far back I would say
 Go for it
 Its a melee spell attack correct You have
advantage on it because hes currently
incapacitated
 Oh my god So roll the dice
 As hes laughing your image walks up with a
skip bends down and touches him and he suddenly
withers into this completely driedout husk of
what the gnoll once was the life force drawn and
cast out of his body He stops laughing and the
body falls like a mummy to the ground
 All right finishing those turns back to
the top of the round
 That ends your turn
 Beau your turn
 Okay
 You manage to catch up right around
basically where Molly is there Do you have a ki
point left
 If you wanted to use your
 Theres cloud and ash embers pushing into
the atmosphere now the nearby building are
actually in flames and engulfed on the side here
 That was a double movement to get to there
 As you and Molly are   feet from each
other and ahead you can see the shape of Nott and
you can see the leader of them You can now see
from nearby buildings that about ten other gnolls
are all gathering around the cart and theyre all
leaving Theyre all carrying giant sacks on their back
dragging bodies and corpses behind them
 Yeah This wasnt the only gnolls that
attacked the city
 Finishing Beaus turn it comes back to
Fjord The rest of the gnolls continue pushing the
cart A few join them giving it momentum
About six more of them begin stepping up
flanking the leader whos now staring at the
three of you
 That ends Fjords turn The leader sees the
three of you there puts the glaive away with one
hand turns around as he draws his longbow and
fires an arrow right at you That is a  to hit
 That is eight points of piercing damage
 The arrow strikes Nott in the chest who
falls unconscious onto the ground the ash and
embers starting to spill over her unconscious
body With that because I believe yeah it can
make two attacks with its longbow Hes going to
make a second strike now This ones going to be
at Im going to make it He cant decide at the
moment Thisll be a four Molly That is a
natural 

 That is  plus three  points of
piercing damage
 He rolled a nine on a d And its a crit
 Molly goes down
 With his movement he puts the bow back away
and keeps walking with the rest of the gnolls
 You watch as all of them turn around and
they all begin to gather You hear this cacophony
of different gibbering cries in the distance as
theyre all starting to call themselves back to
leave the city They all step into the clouds of
smoke and ash in the distance before eventually
all the shapes disappear
 Okay make a survival check in this moment
 It is dark
 Okay Its hard to tell with all the smoke
you cant see the moon you cant see the
placement of the sky but you make a note of which
direction theyre traveling based on the street
Those who are both on the ground as Beau continues
doing this you guys begin to rush up and you see
both Molly and Nott on the ground
 That immediate first breath is filled with
pain both from the wounds youve sustained and
the immediate influx of burning ash that sweeps
into your lungs Both of you come to consciousness
 As you guys begin to regather your troops
more of the crownsguard that you see have been
battling and have been partially wounded by a lot
of the other gnolls are beginning to gather their
dead beginning to try and put out what fires they
can and acknowledge which buildings cant be
saved As you begin to take what remains of your energy to
do so were going to go ahead and take a break
Were going to take a break here and well have a

All right with some of the flames dying down 
minutes or so of the chaos descending the
Crownsguard begin to come back those that are
still living many of them wounded and tending to
their wounds or helping the survivors that are
still within the town You see some families are
starting to unblock their entranceways and the
people who had escaped the city are slowly
beginning to filter in You can hear the sobbing
in the distance of families that are coming back to
homes that have been destroyed The smoke still
chokes the air and at this hour now its probably
come through and begin to take in the essence of whats
happening the armored individual that helped you
when you first arrived and gave you the command to
aid in this approaches You see their halfelven
face solemn and tense approach and extend a
hand There arent many who would immediately
jump into the fray as you did I would say that we
would have lost many more and perhaps all of my
men had you not been there so thank you
 Yeah no worries Unfortunately for the
three skeletal ones you only manage to get one
full ear
 You did Well say for that for those who
wouldve been destroyed or damaged let me go
ahead and roll and see how many ears youre able to
pull off of those bodies
 You manage to pull up about  ears intact
between all the fallen bodies Some you killed
some maybe you didnt You came across the body
elsewhere in the square and just took the ear
 Other guards are collecting them as they go
and there are a couple moments where someone was
going for an orc or a gnoll that you had killed
and you went to the guard and went nuhuh and
they backed off But anyway the soldier head that was
speaking with you extends a hand and they say I
am Watchmaster Bryce Feelid assigned here to
Alfield now in my fourth year Thank you
 Watchmaster Bryce Feelid
 Weve encountered them before yes in
smaller hunting packs maybe a halfdozen at a
time usually on the outskirts They dont come to
civilization like this Its generally too
dangerous for them in the smaller numbers they
travel What the fuck are they after
 Ive maybe crossed one or two as part of
the roving packs its not terribly uncommon
 I have no idea I dont know the ins and
outs of their creepy bestial lifestyle I mean
what And you watch as they sit down for a
second leaning against the wall thinking and
scratching at their chin Word came of a small
hunting party of these beasts spotted to the
south so we sent a small troupe to slay them naught
but two hours before they struck here We had sent
more than half of our mens strength to go and
deal with them so we were unprepared and at the
time unguarded for the most part We were caught
at half strength It cant be a coincidence They
must be desperate to assault headon
like this Theres plenty of small game in the
surrounding wood and theyre known to be provoked
to violence but Ive only heard of gnolls picking
off the outlying folk those that wander too far
from the fields
 They eat what flesh they can get a hold of
but we went through a number of the buildings and
theyve ransacked two of the inns They completely
took the entire butchers stock Theyve carved
the city of whatever meats fresh or dried we
had
 Word came from some of our crownsguard who
were running a patrol
 Not that I can think of For the most part
this far south other than a few runins here and
there they arent conflicts of this size dont
make it past Bladegarden
 Its where most of them Its where most
of the Empires military and guard are trained and
then sent out throughout the rest of the valley
Thats a lot of meat that theyve acquired from
us and theyve lost many I thought of their kin in
this battle as well
 Or whats making them so hungry
 Ive sent three of our scouts to try and
find out where they went track wherever theyre
taking their spoils Reports come in that most of
the bodies they took were dead perhaps not all
We have to do our best to at least recover any
survivors wipe out what remains and prevent this
from ever happening again
 Im going to look into that actually Im
sorry Im still gathering my thoughts
 Okay so you charge out to the far city and
you do find WC still affixed to the cart
currently chewing on a small bag of oats where one
of the families of villagers who fled have come
back and begun to feed him
 To the rest of you Bryce says Well as
rash as it was said and our coffers are not as
strong as they could be I will request more of a
monetary influx up north for the ears you have
taken you will be paid Any more that you find
those will be paid as well
 Well I would normally put you up in the
Candleglow Inn but They gesture over towards the
large building that you had walked through thats
now currently
 That is ironic now that you point it out
 Lets just not let Thadeus know that his
life is
 I will say if you take  minutes to find
good pieces of charcoal and roll an investigation check
 All right you manage to reduce the cost of
you next Find Familiar spell by three gold pieces
 From the hopes and dreams of Alfield So
Bryce looks at you I can have you put up at the
Feed and Mead tavern
 Feed and Mead tavern Its not the most
comfortable place but itll do
 I did not name it but pass it on to Crute
the owner
 Tell him that Bryce sent you and you are
being put up by the Crown for as long as you are
hunting these creatures
 Of course Well They reach into a pouch
and begin to count out the gold for the number of
ears youve collected With twelve ears
 Mmhmm
 After bringing the ears forward they glance
over Actually Ill be right back I may need to
acquire a bit more change And after a brief
wait Bryce returns and you are paid the full amount
 So  gold at your disposal
 Bryce says We hope to hear back in the
morning of our scouts findings If you wish to
if you can hunt whatever remains of these
creatures and bring back proof that theyve been
wiped out Ill see what I can have sent southward
of Zadash to make it worth your while
 I dont mean to be brusque but at the
moment I think we have a number of our guard who
are in more desperate need
 Im sure that would be appreciated For the
moment you all look about as battered as I feel Rest
up come Lets see they would be at Meet me
outside of the Broad Barn
 The Broad Barn
 Barn Broad Barn
They point it out to you its on the
western side of the town There well make sure
you get the basic supplies necessary Hopefully
well have information on where to go and if you
so choose we could conscribe you to be under our
intent to destroy these creatures Think on it
rest well speak in the morning Bryce turns
around and limps off with a few of the other
crownsguard As you guys eventually find your way
to the Feed and Mead you are immediately met by
Crute who is this ornery saltylooking dwarf of
tousled whitegray hair this single tuft of a
beard that dangles down towards the belly button
before it hits a ring of gold goes Oh so Ive
been told youre the ones who were coming to
sleep Got one of our two rooms for you
 He never quite makes eye contact with you
Hes looking at your shoulder or right above your face
 Come Ill show you Turns around and
leads you to your space There are four beds
jammed in here Its like a youth hosteltype
living situation here but its functional
 They are pretty much as twin bed as you can
get
 You can go ask
 Okay You come downstairs and theres nobody
inside this is not a tavern night for a lot of
people Right can I help you
 Smoke we dont have But drink that I can
give you
 Interesting you say Heh Takes out a
bottle looks like a deep green glass and uncorks
it Takes a small shot glass that has a bulbous
bottom pours it to the very top with this liquid
that looks a deep seateal green and slides
it forward
 Well depends on how much you like to
dream
 For that and for what I heard you did
its on the house
 For the night You want more youre paying
topshelf price
 For that drink there that would run you
about three silver
 Not going to complain
 Right right of course
 It has a very smoky oakbarrel flavor to it
at first as it hits your tongue and then it burns
into this very medicinal herbal almost anise
mixed with burnt charcoal
 Okay As you all slowly come to rest
exhausted sore beaten trying to fall asleep to
the distant muffled sound of shouts and wailing in
the streets
 You find yourself to rest preparing for
what the morning may hold and thats where were
going to pick up for next weeks session
 That was some Jackie Chan shit You were in
the doorway dodging everything
 Gif that
 Waste not want not Thats my wife ladies
and gentlemen Thank you guys so much Thank you
guys for watching Thank you DD Beyond Im
learning more and more about the app and Im
enjoying it thank you for supporting the show
Thank you all for joining us tonight well see
you next week and is it Thursday yet
 Good night everybody
 Welcome back You guys are getting sloppy
Welcome back Last we left off our gathering of
friends have been traversing northward along the
Amber Road with the distant destination of
Zadash one of the larger cities of the Dwendalian
Empire as your destination Upon traveling you
passed a caravan spent an evening amongst trees
where you found a wayward cluster of wandering
buffalolike creatures You continued northward
for a second day rushed on past sunset to rest in
the city of Alfield a small farming town thats
along the way to Zadash However upon noticing
that some of the buildings in the eastern side of
town began to light up with flame you began to
approach rather rapidly seeing members of the
city citizens fleeing and screaming and there
seemed to be some sort of attack Upon going into
the town you realized that a number of these
buildings are being set fire by an incursion of
gnolls You were immediately brought in by
Watchmaster Bryce who offered to pay you for each
set of gnoll ears that were brought to them and
you jumped into the fray managed to kill quite a
few many of them still left with their quarry it
seems which happened to be quite a number of
bodies andor citizens still living that were
dragged off into the ashen and cloudcovered
night Upon returning many of you bruised
beaten and at one point in danger of worse you
were given an evenings rest at the Feed and Mead
Tavern and were told if you were interested in
pursuing future coin in helping with the current
conflict nearing the city to meet Bryce out by
the Broad Barn
 That is why
 Thats a different place entirely You guys
all bundled up into a singular room above the
floor of the Feed and Mead Found yourselves
exhausted passed out and got an evenings rest
so youve all gotten a long rest Youve healed
up Youve recovered your abilities As the
uncomfortable warmth of the morning kicks in with
your small room and number of warm bodies
encompassing a very tight and not very drafty
space the partially humid early hours draw you
from consciousness You all begin to stretch your
sore muscles and decide what endeavors await you
with the new day What do you guys want to do
 Bryce had said if you wanted to continue to
help with this then there was more money
 The door slams behind Caleb briskly making
his exit
 I know apparently You head downstairs to
the only other real location within the Feed and
Mead Tavern Theres Crute still there off to the
side and one very dirty and ashy civilian who is
currently slowly scarfing a meal with a thousand
yard stare Looks like they had been close to the
action and chaos the evening before As you walk
down Crute looks across and goes I see youre
awake Would you like breakfast
 All right Itll be about an hour Because
its just me
 Its just me
 Come on
 The two of you jump in with Crute in what is
a not very wellkept kitchen but functional The
gristle who knows how long its been there It
might add to the flavor who knows
 Well put it at a B in Panorama City
 You guys go ahead and help out It does
manage to cut down the time for breakfast
preparation Eventually food is presented
 Make a sleight of hand check
 Youre too caught up in the mealmaking
 Neither does Crute as you manage to do so
swiftly Practiced like youve done this before
in many other establishments in the past maybe
 As you guys finish your breakfast the rest
of the day is yours
 As you emerge from the tavern and Caleb
youve already seen this you see that the fires
have now been reduced to maybe a dozen wide plumes
of graywhite smoke on the eastern side of the
city It rises from the ashes and charred wood
remains and wood frames where some buildings used
to be It seemed much more dangerous and chaotic
last evening but looking at it now in the day
its no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so
that were affected They were more centralized to
cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of
night You get the sense as soon as you look
around that the folks of the city are on edge
understandably so You see the people are trying
to pick up their lives and move on in the face of
what recently occurred The very air holds this
tension as you look around you People walk past
you with sacks of grain and tools their eyes
wide darting around for unseen danger and
glancing past the two tieflings immediately
instinctually step back a bit and make a wide
berth You watch children run from doorway to
doorway trying to stay out of the street as long
as possible It seems like its trying to carry
on but its going to be a process Some folks are
rummaging through the remains of the respective
buildings You glance over near where the central
portion of your conflict last night took place
where the Candleglow Tavern is and there you see
amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn a single
halfling man sifts through the wreckage a
crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams You
see as he plucks what he can of his former life
from the rubble
 You have not met this person no
 You can see a halfling man maybe in his
fifth decade or so He has ashy blond hair and a
face cracked by smiling though now too dour and
sootcovered to see any sort of smile on his face
As he pulls through some of the rubble and hes
making a small pile on the side he looks up and
goes Oh right Can I help you
 I mean if you dont
 You dont have to Okay okay As you dive
in you spend the next ten minutes helping move
through some of the heavier beams that collapsed
There is still somewhat of a structure mainly of
the bottom floor but a lot of the top floor the
one that you were in last night has fallen in
over time So its moving some of the bigger beams
out of the way As youre pulling through and
moving some of the larger pieces of the structure
the halfling man goes I appreciate the help
Names Thadeus Thadeus Candleglow
 It was
  years since I was left this place Built
by my grandpaps Reedus
 Oh I was here When they all came in I
was gone I wasnt about to stay around you know
 Oh I did not I was in the process of
cleaning dishes and dealing with a couple of my
patrons One of them and he points over to the
rubble You can see what looks to be a skeletal
body thats been partially collapsed I suppose
Leimans probably not going to be a regular anymore
 Rebuilding requires something called money
I think Im probably going to gather what I can
here and shop up north and see what other 
work I can get myself to
 I dont know A building establishment like
this Im not entirely certain but I could check
in I assume its probably a few thousand gold
pieces for the structure
 Thats really sweet
 Oh this hasnt happened as long as Ive
been here and Ive been here most of my life
here in Alfield You hear about these things
wandering on the outside and you know crownsguard
keeps you safe Anything comes too close they
just shoot them in the face with a bunch of arrows
and shit
 They didnt take any of the worthwhile
stuff thankfully He points over to a pile and
you can see theres some brass urn or vase thats
been smashed and dented by the conflict You can
see bits and pieces of a few keepsakes that might
be worth a little bit of money that have been
brought out They just mainly took all of our
food stores Most of my meats most of my salted
meats the dried meats the fresh meats the
butchered meats They cleared out the butcher down
the street
 Thats a real curiouslooking face you got
there
 Make a persuasion check
 But in Halfling that helped Yeah sorry
What can I do
 Quite a few Youd have to ask around some
of the crownsguard
 I mean plenty of folks seem to get through
this okay They only took down a few buildings
Im more worried about the folks that were plucked
from their homes
 I havent looked around to be perfectly
honest Ive been a little focused on and he
gestures out with his hands at the rubble that was
once his life
 Well you have to present meat A lot of
people around here eat meat
 If youre asking me then the best meat
Dont know about quantity but quality was 
 Well if at some point the gracious gods
see fit to bequeath upon me a strike of good luck
and I can get to rebuilding my friend one day
you may be able to try one of my meats
 Oh yeah burnt charred
 Oh thats He steps out through where the
doorframe is still standing the one that you
defended yourself through most of that battle
just a freestanding frame now
 He points over to a building across the way
which is one of the buildings that was nearby He
says That theres the Ruddy Top Butcher well
what remains of it and you can see that building
too Its still standing and its nowhere near as
damaged as the Candleglow Inn but its sustained
quite a bit of damage and it looks like the roof
has fallen in
 Yeah if youre looking for farming
supplies general supplies theres
 Oh you could probably find something like
that there The Broad Barn
 At one time it was a barn but the farm
stopped giving up crop and so they converted the
barn itself into what was a general store because
they started selling off the tools they didnt
need but that made them more money than the crops
did that year so we started importing more tools
and for the past  years the Broad Barn has been
our commonly known general supply place there on
the western side of Alfield so if you want
to
 Of course
 Well yall look like youre geared up to
be making a mess You going after these things
 He leans in real close to you getting on
his tippy toes to meet your gaze and he says
Well if you manage to go and kill some of them
dog people you tell them Thadeus Candleglow says hi
 Thank you
 Good
 Im not a child but I appreciate the
gesture
 Gesture Her names Gesture
 The adventurer formerly known as Jester He
takes a bite and 
 I dont think I have much of a choice at
the moment He gives a long stare towards you
that fades past a little bit beyond Anyway I
should get back to picking up the pieces Excuse
me and starts gathering more stuff from the
rubble and the crownsguard behind goes over and
takes the things hes already gathered and begins
putting them into a small crate and doesnt engage
 I know Seriously
 Where are you guys off to
 You were told it was on the western edge of
town and since most of the city is built on two
intersections of main road you follow the core
essential east to west path and on the way out
where you first entered last night even though
you just ran past it you can see there is indeed
right on the edge of town almost like the town
was built to fill the gap in between a very large
barn that looks to have hundreds and hundreds of
feet of coiled rope on the outside The front doors are
wide open and you can see a number of folks are
coming in and out many of them with cleaning
supplies heavy pieces of cloth buckets whatever
can be used to start getting rid of the remaining
black splash and ashy covering of last nights
destruction You also notice as you approach on
the outside theres a bit of commotion You see a
dozen or so crownsguard and a handful of armed
volunteers that all appear to be in regular civvy
farmer clothing that are all gathered in a loose
huddle with Bryce among them You hear a loud
grating voice from within that huddle As you
approach from the outskirts you see a middleaged
male gnome of ruddy complexion and slicked parted
dark hair He wears very clean maroon and gold
robes and that would lend an air of elegance
were he not hopping around and pointing fingers
You see as he starts shouting between the crew
waving his hand around Without any warning it
was your job Bryce With Ruben cold dead that
leaves no Lawmaster to preside forcing me to take
that position as well I do not need that added
responsibility but until we get a new Lawmaster
instated from Rexxentrum I have no choice Bryce
pipes up at this point glancing over and seeing
you guys presence Starosta Ive sent a request
to both Zadash and Bladegarden for a supplementary
force but it may be weeks before any would
arrive Can we send trained hands at my approval
to retaliate At which point the Starosta which
has now been identified says We cannot spare any of
our forces while the surviving guard are drawn so
thin Out of the question Maintain a vigilant
perimeter and deflect any further incursions
Bryce nods slowly Can we at least have
permission to hire mercenary strength to
retaliate then I feel not being proactive before
the gnoll force can fully regroup would put us at a
severe disadvant At which point is cut off by
the Starosta Yes thats fine Hire outside I
dont want any more of my citizens deaths on my
record Dismissed
He immediately pushes through the
crownsguard and storms off which is hilarious to
watch a gnome storm out of a group of people and
off with a huff is escorted by three crownsguard
from behind out of that space The crowd begins
to murmur and disperse and go about their
business Bryce turns and smiles at all of you
Theyve washed up from last nights damage and
dirty conflict so as they approach
 Im deeply sorry about that Starosta Kosh
is highstrung on a holiday and tensions have
never been this high since he was assigned here
eight years ago so please dont take that to
heart Hes just a
 Your words not mine
 No Those in higher political positions
rarely do it seems Anyway I want to thank you
all again for your aid last night I cant fathom
the further death toll had you not been there and
jumped in selflessly as you did Thank you Bryce
trails off and looks back towards where Starosta
Kosh had stormed off and goes Fucking Dwendalian
political bullshit Weve needed a more trained
guard here for weeks especially with Xhorhas
bleeding into the valley but were far too south
to matter Any request has been declined due to
all necessary forces being needed at the garrisons
by Brokenveil If they were doing their jobs at
the Bluffs we wouldnt have so many reports of
violent beasts in the valley in the first place
but here we are At least Ive gotten approval for
a bit more cash To that while I do not know what
your business here is in Alfield if you are still
interested we are in need of some skilled
mercenary work
 Well until at least this threat has been
dealt with in a satisfactory way Ive
unfortunately not had my scouts return after
they were sent the night before which does not
bode well but I suspect that we should see some
sort of hopeful backup sent by Zadash or
Bladegarden within the next week or two In the meantime
were a bit of a sitting duck scenario so Ive
sent a few guards to go to Zadash to see what
other mercenaries could be sent forward We do
have some folks traveling along the road and will
keep an eye out to see if anybody else is looking
for some coin but for now you are our first line
of defense Or offense if you will
 Oh there are plenty of threats Lets see
famine syphilis
 Youre not wrong
 This backwards place has its fair share of
issues as Ive come to learn as being not from
the region but it seems to me that nothing on
this scale has quite assaulted in some time I
mean there have been wandering rumors of terrible
things and creatures wandering past the Xhorhas
border for as long as the Dwendalian Empire has
been around Its the whole reason that the
garrisons up north But this far south generally
the guard can keep things at bay This is a very
organized thing I dont like it I dont like it
at all
 Well this is new Nothing on this scale
 Ive done a bit of research overnight and
it seems that gnolls are known to be very
aggressively hungry creatures Could say famished
to the point of obsession
 The deal stands  gold per gnoll ear
proof of a dead gnoll If you can recover any of
the missing townsfolk here in Alfield and bring
them back safely Id be willing to pay  gold a
head returned
 There is because even if they are gone we
would wish to bury those weve lost I could
probably muster ten gold per retrieved member of
the Alfield citizenry
 Preferably all of them Whatever you can
find
 Seeing what these creatures did last night
I dont know what state youll find any of
them but Im being hopeful
 They seemed to be heading east to a
northeast direction Thats where the scouts went
before they left I wish I had more information
for you but that may be the place to start
 There are some spotty woods on the
outskirts of the town that Alfield was built
into Beyond that its rolling hills and fields
There are some older long grownover settlements
that have been abandoned Smallscale but
honestly beyond here its mainly fields
 If I might offer some advice
 If you do see
a ghost dont engage
 My dear there are ghosts everywhere in
this world Its far more ancient than you assume
 I dont know as to why but its not
uncommon from what I could ascertain Whatever
dark powers they worship it seems allows some to
progress beyond death Rumors are that when gnolls
go hungry and left to feed on each other what
remains rises to fight alongside those that still live
 Honestly I just shared with you most of
all that I had learned
 The only other bit of information I was
able to pull from that was they have this thing
this entity that they worship It has a name
Pulls out a few small notes
 As youre saying this they pull a small
series of notes from their pocket Yeenoghu
 Let that be a lesson young halfling
 I dont know how to pronounce it I only
read it I apologize
 Make a religion check With advantage
 It sparks a memory in you Information
floods your mind and you recall hearing about
various demonic leaders of the Abyss Creatures
that once walked the prime plane You see images
of this large bestial feral angry demon
Everhungering ever wandering to conquer and
devour in its wake leaving destruction fetid
meat and waves of yipping angry hyenas to devour
what was left behind
 Of course
 Its not so much about that more than
these arent welltodo people in their own right
and right now honestly rebuilding
 Thats all right But you as I know quite
well from personal experience have some coin to
your name Perhaps that will be of aid to you
 As far as I could tell whatever living
things they can get their hands on
 Probably
 I will say if there are any surviving
captives then haste is very much key For if they
are as hungry as they seem regardless of the
massive volume they have acquired through the
evening I know not how many their number is or
how hungry they are Take too long there may not
be much left to find
 Right yes The valley aurochs
 No this was far enough west It was mainly
just a few buildings in the eastern side Coming
from where the woods were it seemed like they
were using cover of tree and canopy upon the
incursion then immediately assaulted partway into
the eastern part of the city burned it from the
middle and then used the flames to escape out the
back What were you about to say
 Yes Are you all right
 I could ask around It does happen on
occasion
 If youll excuse me I do have something to
get to But good luck and godspeed
 Ill do my best Bryce turns around and
leaves
 Make an intelligence check
 The robe coloring is what caught you and
the hair The specific slicked and parted comb
You have seen this individual before You were
younger Maybe eight or so years ago Eight or
nine years
 What does this incense come from
 Oh so its part of an adventuring pack
then
 It would be negligible by comparison Id
say maybe at most five silvers worth At most
 Well theres a lot of parts to
 I think both of you do that as you both
separate
 As you walk into Broad Barn there are five
other individuals that are coming through and
picking up thick cloth for cleaning One person is
picking up a few different burn balm kits On the
far end as theyre checking out there is an
extremely old gentleman with this giant gnarled
tuft of a chin beard that merges with this halo
like a lions mane of white hair He has this
really thin long crooked nose Almost like
Engywook from NeverEnding Story but no glasses
Hes trying to keep a smile in the rather dark
faces of the people that are coming in with the
evenings events coming around As you guys walk
in and approach he glances down and goes Well
If yall need something yall just let me know
 Yall want pickles
 He leans back and rummages through what
sounds like a small paper bag
 Theres a small glass mason jar with two
pickles and he goes Im willing to part with
these here pickles
 No its pickles It looks like he may have
just pulled it out of his lunch
 I could part with them for around three
copper
 He takes the copper from you
 He takes the copper from you Slides forward
the pickles and goes  Good deal
 Dont do that That is not conducive to a
lengthy lifetime
 You want incense Thats fancy
 Its really fancy them incense
 Thats why Im curious
 I got incense
 What kind of establishment do you take me
for
 Touch He wanders away from there and
gathers any semblance of anything that could be
considered incense to some degree Its a massive
volume its when he said quality over quantity
this is definitely a quantity circumstance Two big
burlap sacks filled with all sorts of fine ground
herbs and things that could amount to
 Go for it
 No thatll be insight
 An elf
 He seems to be doing the best he can
 Deal
 At this point theres three other people in
the store and theyre slowly filtering out
 It seems that most everything they have
here a lot of them are basic farming supplies
There are a few metallic joints that could be used
for when youre tapping a keg They have some keg
taps there They have oh my god
  I appreciate your patronage
 Thats pretty weird Im going to say
there sir I mean you look pretty weird Thats a
pretty weird request No we do not carry
poisons
 We have insecticides
 For about a vial that big A silver
 Probably have some real serious shits
for a few days
 Yeah
 You do Its a very diluted form of acute
poison to the point where it wouldnt actually
affect any larger creature But if put in a large
batch of water used to spray down crops certain
insects what are they called again I forget
aphids things like that would die off
 Yeah In a very Anarchist Cookbook kind of
way He doesnt sell you acid but there are the
materials available where you could create it
 How many vials worth are you looking for
 Just one This will run you about 
gold
 He looks around Im afraid were clear
out Bit of a 
 Lot of things Sorry
 My apologies
 Its a good pickle
 
 Brine drinkers
 Ugh stop it
 Were not really purveyors of healing
potions and those that have are usually held by
the Crownsguard
 You actually asked the night before and
Bryce had said that theyre currently being used
to tend to the people that were in really bad
places Its hard to walk through a war zone and
be like Hey guys Do you have supplies
 Yes Very stale
 You cant tell if the sour smell is
intentional flavor or just time taking its toll
Itll be tart one way or the other
 Over time you will Theyre scattered a bit
thin and a lot of them are currently focused on
either perimeter watch in case they come back or
helping out those that need help inside the city
 Within ten minutes of wandering through the
city as you guys have gathered yourselves and
begun heading towards the eastern side you see a
crownsguard who is currently walking by with some
washrags under one arm and a little streak of
dried blood down the side of their face Looks to
be a young man probably in his mids or so
Longish hair thats been heavily braided on the
sides and then pinned to the back in a tuft of a
ponytail
 Yes
 Were not allowed to give out any
Crownsguard supplies If youre looking for a
steed youd probably have to go to the On the Wind
Stables Theyre going to be your best bet
 Right and points over towards the
northern side of the town Its one of the
buildings thats taken a little bit of fire
damage
 Its not
 Make a deception check
 Look I mean no offense whatsoever and if
I can go find Bryce and see if we the
Watchmaster would be much more suited to
 Reggie
 Did not make that DC check Reggie glances
over at you He goes Let me see what I can do
and quickly makes his way northward to the outside
of the stables
 About five minutes pass and you can hear the
clopping of hooves as Reggie comes back with a
very obstinate beast on the reins Dragging it
towards you slowly guiding it Reggie doesnt
seem to be a very trained individual when it comes
to handling creatures especially beasts of
burden Will this do
 Hands you the reins
 Best I could do Good luck
 Thank you
 Thank you Thank you
 Just bring it back its on loan Its on
loan
 Okay easy enough to find You placed it at
a hitching post with a little bit of feed over the
evening Your cart and horse are safe and at your
disposal
 They were wearing cobbledtogether or
scavenged bits of leather and hide armors
 It seemed like most of them would have had
some means of disposing of their excrement
 They werent very welldressed
 Okay While you are sending Frumpkin to
keep a watch you are keeping an eye out
for tracks Make a survival check please
 Very quickly you come upon a number of gnoll
footprints in the ground Seem to be multiple cart
tracks That was the one that you saw
 There were multiple carts
 With that roll Id say you surmise
somewhere in the neighborhood of about  or so
gnolls From what you can gather on the tracks
that you found
 You can attempt to glean information
 For the specific sure Go ahead and make a
survival check to see if you can even find those tracks
 Well technically youre tracking undead so
you get advantage on this one
 Same degree You find the tracks you see
there is the remnants of this gnoll horde
returning towards a similar direction You find
three sets of cart tracks
 They all converge into one path They head
through the relatively thin woods that surround
the northeastern side of Alfield As you progress
on that path out to the other side of the woods
continue into the northeastern fields where the
rolling hills begin these hills seem to go on for miles
 Go ahead and make a perception check
 No no Its tall grass across the hills
 The grass can vary anywhere from kneehigh
to chesthigh in places The hills towards the
top can get a little more rocky There are patches
where the grass doesnt grow as well and theres
open dirt and broken shale After about an hour or
so of tracking in that direction you come upon the
Rillway Road which is the main road that heads up
towards Felderwin You can see it a little ways off
 The undead tracks are falling in line with
her tracking Theyre moving as a group but there
are far less undead tracks than there are regular
gnolls so as best you can to keep tabs on it
 Youd be leading if she hadnt made an
equally good roll so now both of you are leading this
 Vibrant green for the most part The wind
is picking up a little bit and you can see
especially when you start coming up over some of
the bigger hills you can see the waves cresting over
the hillside and causing the shift of it Its a
very beautiful space
 At this point now youve been travelling
well say an hour and a half Its getting close
to noon
 Yes
 I know Anyway
 Dont think Im not tempted
 Youre pretty much in the middle of an open
field But the tracks you can see Because you
can see the Rillway Road south of you and the
tracks begin to shift further north As they were
heading back they were keeping off the road best
they can as well You also do notice that within
the tracks you do find bits of grass that are
spattered with drying blood You dont know how
fresh it is Go ahead and make a perception
check
 Perception
 As youre having this conversation with
Fjord youre just not paying attention to the
road in front of you
 No its about as tall as the cart at times
at times its lower You guys do stand out amongst
the grass As you head over the hills or down
below you are above the grass line without an issue
 Yeah its about up to your chest at times
Waist to chest It varies
 Yeah if you wanted
 What could possibly go wrong
 Ill allow it Go ahead and make a
perception check Jester
 Make a strength check
 Just a check
 Right as your eyes catch something you drop
for a second but Beaus beneath you  just
barely holding you the elbows start to buckle a
bit but rallies and  holds you up above
You flatten your back out and give a graceful pose
as you look ahead
 As you guys are coming up over a hill you
get a good view down and you can see between the
tall grass and the high weeds that are beginning
to cluster this vicinity there is a series of
large hills that all break down into this valley
where the grass just ends in this area It looks
like its barren rock and dirt You notice with
that perception check a few carts a few broken
boxes some tables or contraptions Theres some
semblance of civilization here amongst these hills
off the road
 She drops you
 They appear to be empty
 Okay How much do you drink
 Okay good to know
 Perception check for Frumpkin
  good to know
 Its true
 I feel like I passed a stone
 All right whats the plan guys
 Smealth
 Mmhmm All right what are you guys doing
with the cart and the horses
 Okay
 Not that big The hills themselves are
its just large rolling hills in this whole valley area
 Okay You have to back up a bit to get it
out of view
 Having placed the cart where what you assume
is the best you can hide it who is helming the
hiding of the cart
 Go ahead and make a survival check
 All right If youre aiding then do it with
advantage
 Okay I mean sure
 What is the marching order
 All right Whats the order of the line
then
 All right We have
 Molly Nott Caleb
Jester Beau then Fjord Okay I would like you
all to make a stealth check please As you make
your way through the grass
 As you guys stay low to the grass pushing
through with your hands carefully as you go
hearing the wind occasionally rise and fall with a
distant  the various waves of grass beating
against itself you come upon where the grass
begins to fall off You stay low as best you can
before the grass itself comes to an end right on
the outskirts of where the central area between
these hills begins There as you poke your head
through you can see three carts that are
scattered a bit amongst a mineshaft yard The
exterior of a mine You can see large wooden pan
tables some pickaxes that are leaning against the
side the remnants of some lanterns that have
rusted There are the three carts The carts
themselves are spattered with blood You notice
three creatures similar to the gnolls that you
saw the night before but smaller and doglike
These are just basic hyenas that are gathered
around and are licking the blood thats soaked
into the wood One of them ends up finding a piece
of meat or something that was hanging from one
side and tears it off Another one comes over
 and bites onto it and they begin tearing
and fighting over it before one of them pushes the
other over and it  It goes back and begins
licking the blood off the side of the wood These
three hyenas are just scavenging on the outskirt
of these carts
 Not from what you can tell
 From this distance you cant see any
entrances
 About  or so feet  feet
 Quietly this plump wounded with a hint of
pink to the fur around the arm where it looks like
it may have been bleeding a bit begins to hobble
its way silently out of the grass just beyond the edge
 You guys are still hidden
 You initiate the Rite and as you do the
blade begins to give a faint radiant glow a
whitishyellow light that you will almost
instinctually hold low in the grass to make sure
you dont become a beacon amongst your hiding You
watch as one of the hyenas  and begins
making its way The others look over 
they begin to gather up and the three almost go
into this pack swoop formation in the direction of
the rabbit closing in  feet  feet  feet
With a rapid bolt one of them runs forward and
leaps out towards the rabbit and skids into the
dirt past it right to the front of the grassline
where you are Beau
 Okay and who is doing what else
 The three of you rush out and attack three
individual ones What are you guys doing
 All right Beau go ahead and attack first
 Ten You go to swing and as it sees you
suddenly it backs away and your staff hits the
dirt right next to it  It just barely
misses it Caleb you following up
 Go for it Roll your attack roll for the
Fire Bolt
 Right Okay Wait youre going for the one
that Jester is attacking
 Okay Go for it
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 One point of damage
 It begins to burn this small circular image
on the hyenas body 
Go ahead and
 With a natural one he does not
 Thats enough With the blast of the Fire
Bolt and the incineration of the Sacred Flame
you watch as that hyena bursts into fire and flops
to the ground while it burns smouldering its
flesh becoming the meals it had previously feasted
upon Molly and Nott
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 The first strike just completely cleaves it
in half like its momentum running almost like
it hits the blade and you hold it out and the
momentum just carries it over seamlessly carving
through it
 You can have movement to close it Theres
one right in front of Beau so youre a little
ways away but you can close the gap while Nott
and
 Yep
 Nine
 Nine again
 At first it hits the dirt and it backs up
You move out with your heel to go ahead and swing
and it actually ducks underneath and tries to snap
at your heel as Molly closes the gap and
 All right
 All right Go ahead and roll damage With
sneak attack
 Yeah Molly as you rush up you watch as a
bolt just goes right through the side of the
hyenas head and it just falls lifeless to the
ground All three of them out in a split second
 Yeah thankfully it was a clean enough shot
didnt seem to get caught or shatter against any
of the bones
 Perception check
 Glancing about the vicinity does not look
like anything else is moving or near or has
noticed your presence
 Okay Like a massive shotput you watch as
tiny Jester with a double spin each chucks these
relatively heavy beasts deep into the grass field
where they vanish with a heavy thud into the field
 Bunny appears to no longer be around
 You dont see an entrance to the mine you
just see mining equipment
 You see pieces of equipment and the
interior of this hill valley this short little
valley seems to have been prepped for some sort
of mining expedition
 You dont see one at the moment
 Okay You look in the carts and they are
empty You see a few wayward pieces of cloth
everything in there is bloodied and caked and has
streaks of it being licked up It looks like the
hyenas had been at it for a while trying to clear
off what was left behind from wherever the bodies
that were within were taken I would like you both
to make investigation checks please And youre
following the tracks
 Make a survival check
 Because there are undead as a part of this
I will let you
 It looks like the dust and the dirt in this
vicinity has been freshly swept or dispersed
intentionally meaning that once this little
valley had been entered and the carts had been
emptied something was smart enough to
intentionally cover their tracks You however
you rolled a  you said As you begin to look
about the base of the closest hill facing away
from where you guys had entered in an eastern
direction you see a pattern of grasses that seem
to be interwoven as opposed to a natural pattern
there is a consistent mesh to the way theyve been laid
 As you glance over you can see a net of
grasses that has been woven and thrown over
leaving a small gap on the edge where you can see
the dark exterior of what was a mine shaft
structure entrance
 Its about  foot by  foot
 Its pretty thick
 Well its thrown on and put against the
grass it doesnt have sticks in its sides
 No its laid on the side of the hill
 The scavenger levels man All righty It is
too big for you to carry with you but it can
definitely be taken with you should you exit
 All right As you pull it back you do see
the wooden support structure of the interior of a
mine shaft As soon as you pull it back and look
inside it looks like a barricade has been
partially placed up on each side You see piles of
broken furniture stools and chairs that are
shattered and jammed into each other to form some
sort of a barricade on each side You can see
dryrotted pickaxe handles and other pieces of
general wooden beams used for construction that
are all pushed up against the sides with a small
path maybe about three feet wide that you could
walk through to enter It looks pitch black on the
inside There is no light source outside of what
little bit of daylight is coming through from the
entrance
 There is a way theres about a two three
foot gap between this barricade where it made its
way in and once you enter through you can now
see since there has not been dust put there is a
definitive trail of blood that has dragged through
and caked in the loose dirt and dust
 Okay You are now officially intoxicated
 Yep
 For the next hour
 No
 Yeah theres no light in there About 
feet in go ahead and make a perception check
  What faint light is coming in from the
interior are you looking through
 Yeah As soon as you come inside about 
feet in the shaft widens into a common area You
see a handful of tables some chairs similar to
what was placed within the barricade some sacks
strewn about some torn open and scattered across
the ground some that are still lobbed in the corner
 This is just a very high perception roll
with what little light is making its way in there
And thats where it goes dark and theres a
 as Frumpkin hits a sloping ceiling
 No just hits the ground
 Hits the ground stunned
 Not in that main area
 Not with what little bit Frumpkin saw with a
quick glance before it got too dark and then he
hit the ceiling
 Okay
 You move past the barricades heading
towards the shaft the barricade theres a lot
of stuff jammed up here at the front almost like
it was barricaded from the inside long ago and
then was cleared out partially going through You
make it through the  or so feet of the shaft in
towards where it opens up and you almost trip
because your toe catches something and you catch
yourself and you look down to see a long piece of
rope that was stretched across that just got
tugged and falls slack
 You hear a  and with your darkvision
glance up and see what appears to be a large log
that had been affixed to the ceiling 
Comes rushing towards you Make a dexterity saving throw
 Dex saving throw yeah
 With disadvantage You even in your
somewhat hazy drunken stupor see it just in time
and back up as it  right past your nose
and slams into the wall to the left of you It
hits and you see the dust settle from the
ceiling
 You guys all hear this  from the
inside
 It is actually It opens up to be about 
feet across from side to side about  or 
towards the end and then it seems to descend into
two different pathways
 Make a perception check
 At the moment no But as youre glancing
about you can see that there are bags of supplies
that are partially sundered and torn open You can
see tools some that look pretty interesting
theres a crowbar on the ground across the way
theres other sacks that havent been spoiled yet
You see some of the burlap is dry rotted and pulls
right apart and it looks like there might be some
useful things in this chamber
 Make an investigation check with
disadvantage
 You glance through and find a bunch of
mildewed rice grain Right as you hear a 
 You glance over and from the right chamber
you see as two gnolls have appeared in the
entranceway and have entered up called from the
sound of the heavy impacting thud on the wall but
a few moments ago
 They both no hes not She is not sorry
They both arrive to the top of the sniffing and
growling They both grab their spears
 What are you doing
 As theyre both right there rushing towards
you you say this and youre going to pull out and
fire at one The one to the right or the left
 The one that first spotted you would be the
one on the left so as its rushing towards you go
ahead and fire
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points of damage not
 Okay  points of damage It hurts but
its still rushing forward They both begin to
rush in to close the gap The rest of you guys rush in
to get to him it will take the full round to get
there You guys use your movement and dash in
Those of you who dont have darkvision you cant
see anything
 A faint bit of light At this point any of
you with ranged abilities right now would be able
to strike But before you do two of the gnolls
rush in and are attempting to attack the small
goblinoid female who has walked into their lair
The first strike that is going to be a  to hit
 That is six points of piercing damage as the
spear jams into your shoulder and scrapes down the
front of your chest glances off the rest of your
armor and it hurts but youre fine Youre still
feeling a little fuzzy anyway The other one
attacks that is going to be a  to hit
 No This one you do see coming and you
dodge out of the way But theyre both right up in
your face right now snarling and  With
that the guys who have ranged attacks go for it
 Yes
 So you guys have disadvantage on any of your
attacks rolls because you cannot see You are
blind in the chamber
 For this round because theres just two
gnolls at the moment Im just going through
actions here to keep going
 Okay so the one thats closest to you will
be the one that already took damage from the bolt
so roll for attack for the Guiding Bolt
  hits Roll damage
 Ten points
 The one thats now taken a crossbow bolt to
the throat and has taken a Guiding Bolt this giant
blast of light explodes around this gnoll as it
yelps and it encompasses its torso with this
glittering light Now the next attack against it
has advantage It is super hurt but still
standing Youre making your attack
 You were attacking the other one so you do
not get the benefit
 Still hits go ahead and roll damage on that
one
 What are you using
 Its a d for damage Thats a d
 Nine points of damage on that one It gets
blasted by the bolt of eldritch energy however
its still snarling Currently theyre both
looking over at the sudden surge of newcomers
 Okay what does that do
 They rolled an eight minus yeah it does
not make the save
 Got it great
 All right The room fills with light at this
point The chamber fills you can now see the
scenery around you Nott youre up first Since
youre the first one to get a shot Theres one
thats super hurt and one thats kind of hurt
 Correct
 Nott theyre both right up in your face
snarling
 Okay so go ahead and make your melee spell
attack I believe it is right
  hits
 Seven it is As you reach up and grab it
with your hand you watch as a burst of electrical
arcane energy surges through its body You watch
as veins pop up its torso to its neck before it
collapses into the ground You have to duck out of
the way before it slams It would have crushed you
if youd stayed in the space you were but you
sidestep in time as the gnoll falls to the ground lifeless
 Yeah
 Okay On the other side As youre doing
that the gnoll thats right there sees you rushing
off but now its more attentive to the one who
blasted it there Id say for the sake of
distance since the moment you saw you fired it
probably couldnt close the gap so its going to
drop the spear pull out its longbow and take a
shot at you from here
 Its going to be a  to hit whats your
armor class
  all right Not a great roll you take
four points of piercing damage
 It catches you right in the middle of the
sternum The armor takes the brunt of it and it
mostly just snaps at the impact but it hurt
Itll bruise That ends the remaining gnolls
turn Next up would be Beau
 Theres one you can close the gap with
Theres only one thats currently standing in the
room the other ones been killed It was shocked to
death by Nott
 Go for it
  hits go ahead and roll damage
 Ten points of damage thats enough to do
it It had already been damaged previously by
Fjords Eldritch Blast and you watch as it snarls
and pulls out its bow pulls back notches and
releases the arrow Moments after its released
with a quick burst of action you saunter up to its
side and hit it across the torso with the stick
You feel seven different ribs break as it doubles
forward As it looks at you for a second you take
where the staff has broken in and jam upward
to where its lungs would be and it 
and falls to the ground dead
 You guys take a moment here
 Yeah as Notts saying this your eyes wander
off of her over to the right where you see this
heavy tree covered in jagged bark thats

 Okay There are two shafts Both seem to
descend Both curving off in opposite directions
They both have the wooden frame for support
 Looking around it looks like this was a
common area This is the closest chamber to the
exterior of the mine It looks like there were a
number of tables here that a lot of them have
been knocked over and broken A lot of what would
have filled this chamber has been pushed into the
barricade you saw up front Youre helming the
investigation Go ahead and make an investigation check
 You guys are looking down the shafts
Theyre looking in the sacks
 Both of the shafts just descend and curve
out of view They go to a steady degree decline
 Youre too drunk to help
 Youre looking as well Sure take advantage
then
  Okay You glance around You find
theres an untapped ale barrel theres an
untapped water barrel theres a hooded lantern
that still has a functional bit of oil in it
though its only about halffull and very rusted
over but you clear off the glass on the outside
and itll work fine You find a sledgehammer that
the handle is not so rotted to the point where it
wouldnt be functional but a fair sledgehammer if
you wanted to break any rock or stone The crowbar
that you had seen earlier that can be acquired
 You find a small lightweight rod about that
long that has a short piece of waxed twine
hanging from one end
 No its not metal It feels almost like a
hard clay
 With a waxed piece of twine on one end
 You had as good a chance as anybody to have
come across this so if you want to make an
intelligence check
 You havent come across one of these
 No theyre big heavy filled things
 You make an intelligence check
 Ten okay
 Once its ignited and the oils lit yeah
you can open and close the hood
 Nott youre an alchemist
 Yeah as youre looking over it its not
beautifully made it looks functional like a lot
of the tools here there isnt a lot of
presentation more than function as what you bring
into a mine
 Yeah
 You take the rod and smell it and a familiar
scent hits your nose Youve worked in your
alchemical time with smalllevel explosives As
part of the elements of the alchemists fire
there is a reagent catalyst that when the
chemicals mix it causes a minor explosion and then
burns heavily there is an element of that but
its very very strong and a very intense scent to
it As soon as you smell it it brings back
memories of accidents that have happened in the
past on a very small scale You immediately get
this wave of cold shiver down your neck that this
is a very dangerous object if used improperly
 Yeah You can sling it in with your
 There are two paths yes
 Okay so make a stealth check first
 Well with advantage but then disadvantage
from the drunk so its just a straight roll
 Yes
 Okay good to know Then youre going to
check for traps
 Make an investigation check with
disadvantage
 Dexteritybased and intelligencebased
checks
 Okay
 Okay and which path is this youre
checking
 You dont sense any draft the air is pretty
stagnant actually
 Seems to be On the left path you do not
notice any traps anything akin to what you
stumbled across as you entered It does seem to
descend and curve out of the way but begin to
snake a bit You get about  to  feet down
before it begins to rapidly curve left and right
its only about ten feet wide You can continue if
you want
 They both seem fairly equal Youve been
keeping tabs on footfalls in here Theres traffic
both ways
 Make a stealth check please
 Disadvantage
 Oh its straight roll because
 All right and investigation check with
disadvantage
 With disadvantage
 You begin to curve down the right path and
there is a slight depression on one side that you
glance over and look and it looks like some of the
burlap that had been torn from the sacks earlier in the
tunnel had been used to cover a three and a
half foot wide pit that has been laced over to
hide its presence
 Yeah its affixed with a couple of rocks in
the sides its very light and would have fallen
through It only covers part of the path The
tunnel is about ten feet wide and the right side
of it is where that pitfall is You notice it and
go Oh hmm This one does not snake this one
continues in a continual curve for another  or
so feet before youre starting to get a little far
from your friends You can continue if you want
 It looks like its going in a downward
spiral
 Great album
 As you all slowly begin to descend down the
right path
 Well come to that in just a second Were
going to go ahead and take a break Since its a little
past nine Well be back here in a few minutes to
pick up the descent further into this mineshaft

 Congratulations to the two of you guys
Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact
information and well get those sent to you ASAP
so well done
Yes all right You chose the right or the
left again
 The right okay Down the path the shaft
winds for about another  or so feet before it
slowly levels out into a long chamber of multiple
levels What once looked like a solid mining vein
is now strewn with bones and flayed skin pinned to
the rock walls with scavenged nails blood
spattered across them with intent painted a jagged
smile of sharp teeth on each of these four hides
A faint source of light in the center flickers a
small stone altar holding a cluster of candles in
the central level platform It looks like about
six gnolllike figures have gathered around this stone
 I know Were going to get to that in just a
second
 While a strange seventh figure places small
wet stones upon this altar smaller than the other
gnolls Lets get a perception check real fast
from two of you Whos leading the
 Well say since you two would be in the
front then for that you jumped up first
Perception check both of you
 Okay so you dont see much of the figure
Also right now Ill have you guys all do a
stealth check please as you make your way down
 Okay
 This figure looks gnolllike you see the
ears and the snout but as it reaches down and
picks up these wet stones and places them in the
altar giving small dark muffled barks and
yipping sounds you see elements that look like
smooth human flesh The more that you focus in
you can see this looks to be a humanoid figure
that is wearing pieces of hollowedout gnolllike
armor A hood missing a jaw thats placed over the
top of the head sections of arms worn like a
glove with the hand missing sifted through It
seems that a lot of the body parts are discolored
and rotting a bit from what you can see from the
candle light thats flickering across it Long
bonelike spines similar to what adorned the armor
of that pack lord that you battled in the middle
of the city last night are also affixed to the
outsides and pierced through elements of the
shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that
its wearing As it growls mimicking the sounds
of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along
the other gnolls around look pacing from foot to
foot impatiently  Begins to
speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a
final wet stone on it All the remaining gnolls
begin to bark in unison together 
 They all at once leap onto the altar and
begin tearing into the stones which are not
stones They were glistening At this point you see
hearts that are now being torn and swallowed by
the gnolls at the altar
 They finish devouring the hearts and the
humanoid figure begins to bark a few more times
and then in broken Common says The hunger will be
them Help me carry more meat below The rest
stay Feast on what remains Turns around and you
now look across the way On the other side of the
chamber darkened you see a gnoll leaning in
had left with the carts is watching from the
far end of the chamber down on the lower thirdlevel
platform
 The weird gnoll priest I guess you could
say at this point thats been helming this little
ritual goes and joins the armored gnolls and steps
aside and follows second and the two gnolls that
were assigned by it leave as well leaving four in
there in the chamber currently
 No the armored one leaves with the priest
 The candle altar Yeah Its not an
extremely bright light but for those of you who
are human its enough where you can make out
shapes once your eyes have adjusted to the low
light interior
 You watch as they begin to grab the bodies
on the ground You can see there are now The
grinding of bones as they drag broken corpses
across the floor and begin to tear into the torsos
  You watch as four hyenas fill into
the space where the gnolls are and begin to sit at
bay waiting for the gnolls to finish feasting One
of them gets close and the gnoll just grabs its
head and shoves it against the wall and it snaps
into the wall and then backs up and then waits its
turn You can see the other hyenas that exist in
this space naturally scavengers have to wait
being at the lowest of the totem pole
 Four gnolls four hyenas
 It didnt seem to be too much More to just
keep it away from the meal
 If youre planning to engage should I show
you the layout of where theyre placed
 So here we have
 They all tend to carry a bow on their
backs
 You can see now the hyenas that are waiting
patiently This one got knocked into the wall
Theyre scooting at the sides waiting for them to
finish their meals You guys are right up here
where the shaft opens glancing down into this
chamber That was where the priest and the other
gnolls had exited
 You guys are up on here Which for the
purposes of
 Its fine
 Correct
 It looks like it was a stalactite that then
was reinforced as a column to help
maintain the structure
 A fifth gnoll begins to wander its way into the
chamber
 It goes over and kicks one of the hyenas off
to the side It sits there 
 Yeah this tunnel is a tenfoot wide tunnel
that continues backward
 If you wanted to turning you backward here
theres this path here We could continue the
tunnel back this way
 The farthest gnoll there About  or so
feet
 You may
 Which as a note to remind you from last
time
 Correct yeah so keep that in mind
 Right here
 Roll a stealth check
 Do you still have the gift
 Oh yeah
 At a closer glance you look and see One of
them currently is holding a pair of legs that are
no longer attached to a torso and is stripping
the flesh from the thigh and leg tearing into it
Takes a piece and chucks it off to the side and
the two hyenas fight over it Another one back
there you can see is clutching a scapula the
back of a shoulder blade and is breaking the
bones in half and sucking the marrow out At a
quick glance you get the sense that some of these
may have been denizens of Alfield as of  hours
ago
 The gnolls
 Most of them have a longbow slung over their
shoulder and have a spear that dangles off to the
side or has been jammed in the ground next to
them
 Duplicity or are you doing Mirror Image
the spell
 The one that breaks and sucks the marrow out
of one of the large shoulder blade areas takes and
grinds the teeth against it scooping out
whatevers inside then throws that piece onto the
ground next to it then takes the arm and begins
to splinter the middle of the arm bone and try to
get the marrow out of that
 Does your spell have concentration You are
concentrating on a spell at the moment Beau you
quickly leap and land with no sound catlike
reflexes
 Your foot does slide for a second as you
glance down and where you stepped in it looks
like theres a bit of leftover pieces of people
 Okay It slowly lifts and one of the other
gnolls thats eating   and the
other one goes  and they go back to
eating
 What is it What are you using
 That spell is not concentration Right
okay
 As soon as Frumpkin begins doing that you
watch as the one thats nearest on this side the
one that had dropped the arm piece earlier takes
the bow off its back and begins to notch an arrow
looking around Its going to take a shot at the
bird fluttering through That is a  Whats Frumpkins
 Six points of piercing damage The bird goes
 on the ground and then dissipates You
watch as the four hyenas suddenly rush in towards
where the bird had fallen and they all go to the
spot where it landed and find an arrow lying
there and 
 The range on that is
 Youre placing it where Right there
 All right Which one
 Okay Go ahead and roll a spell attack
 Nice Roll damage on that that definitely
hits
 Same dude That is a 
 That would have been his dexterity saving
throw right
 Yeah then no damage Okay that ends your
turn Everyone else gets one action and then we
roll initiative
 Sure You wont get to hide though but
youre there Youre standing next to a barrel
All righty whos up next
 Fjord what you got
 You can pick one All of the gnolls in here
look like regular gnolls
 What are you doing
 Yep It appears into your space in a burst
of dull greenishblue fire and there you see it
dripping with salt water across its blade
 You may That one is now hexed You watch as
the gore thats been dripping from the front of
its body seems to roll up its torso in reverse
before it slips into its armor and grasps itself
the darkened shadowed gore now holding it in place
as the Hex curse
 You may
 That hits Plus d
  points of damage  That one
immediately drops what it was eating as the blast
slams into it as its confused by the wrapping of
the Hex As it reels and almost stumbles onto its
back its foot crushes one of the nearby skulls
and there you see this gaping wound in its chest
where the armors been sundered Theres a smoking
plume of blackened horrible shaded smoke pouring
from it
 Thats as far as you can there
 Beau
 Thats  there
 You hear hundreds of tiny metal clangs in
succession as ball bearings begin to spray down
the stairs and scattering across the floor of this
central makeshift ritual room As they run through
the semblances of gore and the areas of the
stonework that are exposed between you have spent
your action scattering
 Nice As soon as you empty those out you
get back and go into your defensive position
preparing for any sort of assault Caleb
 The ball bearings in this moment are now
clattering down into the ground
 He did yes
 Roll for an attack
 That hits just barely
 Seven points of damage The one that you
had hexed suddenly goes up into flames with a
 and falls back onto the ground
 You are just there As the flash of red
light arcs from his finger and lights up the path
before it impacts and kills the gnoll Caleb then
steps back into the shadows trying to get out of
the way Nott
 Yes but that technically did not initiate
into a combat It just bothered one of them
 A temporary inconvenience
 Go for it
  hits Roll damage
 Nine plus your sneak attack
 Because you were stealthed
 That one  The bolt goes through
the center of his forehead and embeds itself right
up to the very back You watch as it  and
falls into the ground over one of the piled corpse
pieces it was tearing through Becoming one with its
meal And then
 Okay make a hide check to try and disappear
back there Stealth on that one
 Okay You did your thing Molly
 You can get right into the similar space as
Nott there
 I would say barely
 It rolled a natural one on its saving throw
 Good to know Now everyone please roll
initiative
 Its technically a dexterity ability check
so it would be disadvantage yeah
  to 
 Fjord what did you get
 Sorry So who else rolled a natural 
 Right yeah But dont you have advantage
with
 Just on stealth checks thats right So
Mollys up first Thats a fun little initiative
tracker thing from our friends at Axe  Shield
See how it helps out there
   to 
 The gnolls rolled a natural  plus one so
theyre at  Gnolls are next
 Both of you guys are at 
  to ten
 Jester got  Ten to five
 They hyenas are before Nott Then we have
Nott then we have Fjord Molly youre at the top
of the round
 Gets the idea across The special hyena
 What you got Molly
 Hold your position
 All right Natural  on the saving throw
unfortunately
 Sorry
 All right thats your turn All right the
gnolls are up first These two here are going to
pull out their bow and begin to fire at Beau
Since you had been the first to appear at this
point and gather their attention They both have
disadvantage on the attacks That is going to be
an 
 The other is two s in a row so it would
be  to hit
  to hit sorry
 Yeah all right
 That would be
 Yep Thats going to be ten points of
piercing damage to you
 Well its a ki point to throw it back
 You catch it in midair and reduce it to no
damage
 As you do that the one in the bottom of the
ground who is closest to you grabs its
spear off the side of the wall  Runs up
the stairs
 Thats what Im
 Rolling its dexterity check to see if it can
do so It does succeed Its a  It slips but
it manages to make its way up the stairs
 Coming into combat with both Fjord and Beau
Hes going to go ahead and reach out at you with
that Its going to be a 
  misses
 After you drop the arrow it comes up and
you parry this one off to the side and go back
into your defensive stance That ends both of
thoses go there Now comes to Caleb
 All right go for it Roll for attack
 It strikes part of the stone altar
splintering candle wax and pieces of remnant heart
chunks but no impact unfortunately on the actual
gnoll
 You going to stay where you are
 Right so Beau you want to go with your
action now
 Go for it
 As you swing the bo back trying to crack
him in the head it actually slips on one of the
ball bearings you had left and as it manages to
catch itself it falls out of range of your sweep
of the bo Youre like Shit
 All right go for the attack
 You slip on one of your own ball bearings on
the second strike and manage to catch yourself by
grabbing the fur on the outside of the gnoll and
using its body to right yourself and then Ugh
Its a little slick and sticky
 All right Jester youre up
 That are standing This one has been hurt a
little bit
  hits plus five hits even more
 Nine points of force damage as the lollipop
hits it in the back of the skull and it leans forward
and grabs the back of its skull with this
pounding throbbing pain in its head
 All righty So what does it have to roll
 Okay And the range of that one is
 So that rolls a nine plus zero nine
 Just a little bell You watch as a little bit
of blood comes out the side one of the hyenas ears
 So the spiral kind Gotcha Are you going to
move at all or are you going to stay where you are
 Okay that ends your turn
 There you go There is a whole dance number
over there of multiple Jesters The hyenas go now
 Does succeed on his dex save This ones going
to attempt
 Leaps up to there Dexterity saving throw
does succeed
 Succeeds Theyre actually
rolling pretty high for their saving throws This
one will be a three that one does not make it
This one gets partway over and then falls prone
there Uses the other half of its movement to get
up but thats as far as it can get It cant
actually attack for this round Its going to use its
movement to make the rest of its run up to the top
of the stairs So that one does not get an action
this turn because it slipped on the ball bearings
Its going to be one attack against Beau
 With disadvantage Thats a natural  and
a six
 Yeah that does not hit not at all Its
plus two The hyena rushes up and lashes out
towards you and you just pop slap it in the nose and
it pulls back
 Yep The two other ones that rush up and
come along the flank with the hyena to you Fjord
First one goes that is going to be a  plus two

 All right Actually it has advantage on the
roll because of pack tactics It didnt really
help lets see here You take two points of
piercing damage
 The other one is going to attack you
  Which causes it to shatter into ice
on the ground It bites you and its snout
 T style It shatters into a
million ice pieces
 Yep
 Thank you The other one is going to take a
strike at you Natural  its a critical hit 
and ten That pack tactics is nasty That means
you for dice wise suffer eight points of
piercing damage It takes ten and it explodes into
ice as well Both of these hyenas rush up and
strike and both in succession disintegrate into
shards of ice across the ground
 The spell is gone though right
 Thats going to end the hyenas turn Nott
youre up
 Okay
  As you drunkenly try and aim in the
direction
 You almost pull the trigger twice but youre
aiming at Fjord and youre like No
 No advantage but he can sneak attack if he
hits Thats how it works You finally go and one
of the elements of stone in the side of the cavern
wall  as the bolt hits it and goes sideways
 Yeah youre revealed
 You have to find a way to obscure
somethings vision to you before you can hide
 Thatll work Go ahead and roll a stealth
check as your bonus
 Youre a rogue this goround man All
right that ends Notts turn Fjord youre up
 You may
 Go for it
back and forth
  hits
 His ACs 
 Ill allow it
 Yeah youve got to say it Twohanded Ill
allow it
 So this one that had already  points of
damage right
 This is the one that you hit earlier with
it As you swing with your falchion just spinning
it in your hand you arc upward As you do you
watch as the gore and shadow of your Hex which
now seems to grasp around its chest almost
reaches out to meet the blade in the middle like
the two bits of lightning hitting in the center of
the sky As they impact the blade carries through
the momentum the strength coming from the blade
not from your actual body As you do you carve
through a large portion of its torso You watch as
the hide armor folds off revealing this huge gash
wound in its chest It 
Its still standing but its horribly wounded
now
 That end your turn Fjord
 All right to the top Molly youre up
 All righty
 Go for it
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points of damage As soon as it rears
from the attack Fjord you watch as in a flash
the cloak billows of Mollymauks arrival As the
cloak falls you just watch as the gnolls head
just rolls off of its shoulders You can see the
blow that struck it
 Go for it
 Thats its armor class Hyena doesnt have a
whole lot of armor
 Eight points of damage With the one strike
you turn around and look at the hyena 
with the offhand and just carve right through it
 Wait because that didnt have the
 Well the glowing one is your main hand
 Then your offhand is the other one
 So what damage would it have been without
the bonus
 Four damage All right so its still there
You carve through and its wounded but its
still 
 You could have
 The idea is the bonus action attack happens
as part of the attack action
 No worries you can keep that in mind next
time Its all good you still beat the shit out
of it with your offhand So that ends Mollys
turn Those two gnolls in the back this guy is
going to back up as he attempts to make a
dexterity save Fails So he falls prone uses the
rest of his movement to get back up so he can
only move ten more feet so he cant get that much
further away Hes going to go ahead and take a
shot this guy is going to go ahead and pull back
hes out of the bearing range and begins making
his way towards the door
 Theyre both going to take shots at Fjord
Actually one at you one at Molly Theyre not
going to fire at you because you visibly caught
one and dropped it in front of them like Fuck that
 Against Fjord thats going to be 
 And against Molly
 Okay That brings it down to a 
 All right as the one that is going to fire
at you Molly pulls back its arrow its eyes suddenly go
dark and begin to bleed from the inside It
suddenly  and releases it and you watch
as that arrow splinters against the central
column The one that does come towards you Fjord
however does strike true You suffer eight points
of piercing damage as this one catches you right
in the abdomen a little bit to the right tapping
something kidneyish in that vicinity and you feel
this sudden dull pain and nausea overcome you
Thats going to end the gnolls turn Caleb
youre up
 You can see this one This one is
technically being blocked by that central column
 Go ahead and roll your spell attack
 Whatd you roll
 No unfortunately
 It skitters off the central column and goes
spinning out of control as the electrical sphere
shatters against the stonework and dissipates the
energy absorbed by the surrounding stonework
 Yeah that would be your full movement there
Pretty close
 Ending Calebs turn Beau
 You could say maybe hes about  feet from
you
 You can certainly try Make an acrobatics
check for me
 As you run off the edge the hyena takes a
swing at you That is going to be a 
 You feel it snap at your heel but does not
actually grasp any of your body
 You push off of him run across this wall
leap hit this pillar and then using the momentum leap
and land right in front of the gnoll there
 What was the other one
 Roll both Yeah As you swing down the
gnoll manages to see you up in the air and side
steps as you hit the stonework
 
 Damage on that one
 Eight points of damage nice As its
laughing  its jaw is
dislocated and it snaps back into place You see
some of its teeth broke It looks kind of dazed
and hurt by it Its looking pretty rough its
taken some hits in the past Thats the end of
your turn
 All right that brings us to Jester
 Yeah thatll do it  feet
  No Im afraid that will not hit As the
lollipop comes around the corner it sees it
coming and moves to get Beau to intercede between
the lollipop and itself At that moment youre like
Oh I cant quite and you end up withdrawing
and not making the strike this round for fear of hitting Beau
 All righty so thats a wisdom save Thats
six no
 Seven points of damage As you release the
surge of energy the sound begins to vibrate
in its ears as it  and it reaches up
as both of its eardrums burst on the sides of its
head and it falls to one knee looking like its
completely ruined and dazed And Beau you have a
moment to coup de grce it You  and break
its neck with one swoop of the bo Combined you
both finish off that gnoll
 Jester you want to move
 Okay End of Jesters turn The hyenas This
hyena is going to move past
 No that one was not in melee with
him That ones going to move up to you Fjord
Attacking you Fjord that is a six
 Attacking you Molly That is a 
 You take two points of piercing damage as it
snaps at you Seeing that theyre both beginning
to glance about and see that their allies are
starting to back away and theres a lot of you up
in this upper area theyre both going to attempt
to break away with the rest
 Yep both of you do
 Both hit Roll damage
 Main hand This one is hanging on by a
thread Its the one you damaged last round
 Yeah you carve that one You
 As theyre rushing you both 
simultaneously strike back at it as theyre
attempting to flee and they stumble down the
stairs
 Perfect Their bodies stumble to the ground
and end up its weird because their bodies hit
the ground and the momentum carries them as they
slide across the ball bearings almost like
theyre lagging
 Finished the hyenas round Nott youre
up
 Make an insight check
 It is not disadvantage on wisdom checks 
This gnoll looks like its ready to fucking bolt
It is on the way out of the room The tide has
turned its starting to see more and more of you
appear at the top of the stairs as the hyenas and
its friends are being destroyed Its going to run
 It immediately goes  and falls on
the ground on its back and is now rolling with
laughter Laughter that is echoing through the
halls and making its way through the tunnel
 Make a dexterity saving throw
 As you hear that just as you reach the
bottom of the stairs
 Okay you get to the bottom of the stairs
and you barely begin to slip and catch yourself
Its a DC  However you continue to run
 Thats about as close as you can get on
your  movement
 Yes you may
 Actually make a concentration check Youve
taken some damage and I forgot to maintain your
Hexs concentration
 Make two for me if you dont mind
 Correct Thats fine
 Yeah youre fine The Hex moves over
 Whenever you take damage and you have a
spell thats concentration you have to
 I know
 Eldritch Blast
 Disadvantage Because its still prone
  Still misses unfortunately It hits and
gleans off of its armor However it isnt quite
strong enough to actually make a painful impact on
its body and slams into the nearby rock causing a
spray of dust and debris
 Correct All right That ends your turn
Fjord Molly youre up
 Thats as far as you can get right there
 That actually is a  Whats your DC
 Right Against whatever your spell DC is
 Spellcaster technically We will say for
the purposes of this its eight plus proficiency
bonus which is ten plus whatever your charisma
modifier is
 Yeah Not a big deal For now Well tighten
it up Cool So no effect there Mollys turn is
over The gnolls turn It is laughing its ass
off Now does it make
 All right Which is a  It manages to
shrug off the laughter
 No Its just on the ground going confused
whimpering Its about to try and get back up
Caleb youre up
  It has disadvantage because its still
prone
 Yes Against ranged spells
 Yeah you release it and it just skids
across the ground Like skipping a stone across a
lake It slams into the wall behind it and

 Its all good man Just survive to level
five and everything will turn Unfortunately it
does not hit
 All right Beau youre up
 You have advantage because it is prone
 Youre just getting your attack so yeah
still with advantage
 Heres what you do You walk up Tap tap
Leap and right as youre in the air the gnoll
kicks out of laughter Rolls out of the way and
you wham
 The worst funny bone pain shoots through
your arm as you get up
 You still have your bonus The gnoll actually
starts laughing again
 Roll the attack You still have advantage
Yeah because its still prone
 That will shut it up
 So as its laughing you kick it in the head
and you see it stunned on the ground for a second
and its eyes kind of rolling in different
directions Nice heavy crack to the side of its temple
 Okay ending Beaus turn Jester youre
up
 Okay that does have advantage because it is
technically in melee with it
 Nope Its just rolling out of the way of
everything Its doing what Beau did in the last
fight but on the ground
 Unless it rolls a natural 
 This one gnoll is just holding on so hard
Jester I think that ends your turn unfortunately
 The hyenas are dead Theres no hyenas
left
 You watch as four shimmering Jesters all
kneel down and shake their heads in their hands
Beau is over there going 
 This gnoll is going to need some serious
therapy Nott youre up
 Its prone yeah so melee attacks have
advantage
 Youre at disadvantage with a ranged
attack
 You have disadvantage from a ranged attack
up close and disadvantage against a prone
creature Right now with your crossbow its
disadvantage regardless
 Now you have advantage on the attack
  hits Go ahead and roll damage with your
sneak attack
  points of damage How do you want to do
this

 As its cackling and moving around I like
to imagine this is all happening simultaneously
Beaus on the ground holding her elbow the weapon
misses and its rolling and cackling and starting
to get up and youre like Hmm there 
Almost unceremoniously its like  and
falls limp on the ground where you place it Its
almost like the slow push from Saving Private
Ryan Youre like Shh shh shh
  and it expires there on the
ground
 Everyone takes one point of psychic damage
 They are noticeably smaller and not gnoll
ears
 Okay Five sets of gnoll ears and four sets
of hyena ears
 All right
 The next ten to  minutes or so youll be
able to shake off the alcohol
 Okay It does not appear to be trapped
  Its locked
 Okay Go ahead and attempt with
disadvantage to pick it
 Its proficiency bonus which is two plus
your dex bonus
 As the adrenaline pumps through your system
it wakes you up a bit and even with the
intoxication thats been flooding your system you
steal a moment of clarity and it opens without an
issue You glance at it and the chest looks like
its been bashed in a little bit like one of the
gnolls was trying to get into it and eventually
gave up got flummoxed and threw it on the
ground As you open it up from the inside you can
see essentially a central medical pack if you
will An emergency pack for any of the miners that
had gotten hurt or wounded There are two healers
kits in there There are a number of disinfectant
herbs and funguses Anybody who is proficient in
medicine would know how best to utilize those I
dont know if any of you are
 Then its a risky endeavor to maybe use one
You do find a small leather hand pack that
contained four glass vials three of which were
shattered from the rough movements when it was
tossed around but one that is still intact That
contains a healing potion
 It is It is a greater healing potion not a
standard healing potion
 You can mark down medicinal supplies would
be what youd call it You are not entirely certain
as to how they are applied but they are probably
healthy
 Youre proficient in medicine Yeah I was
asking if anyone was proficient with it
  Fair enough The medicinal supplies
you have acquired can be utilized to remove
poisons if quickly applied to where the poison
was put It has two uses If an action is taken to
apply it to a wound whether a bite or a wound
that was poisoned it can help remove the poison
 Its an action to apply it yeah
 As you step forward a little bit make a
perception check
 You hear echoing muffled in the distance
Some yipping some conversation in whatever this
gnollish language is You hear a deep resonant
 and a distant  An impact
and a sound near  Thats all Sounded quite
a ways away like this echo had been traveling a
ways down this tunnel
 You hear a few other cackling chuckles that
echo shortly thereafter
 Make an investigation check please
 Okay Looking about the altar you find some
smaller pieces of fresher flesh that have been
stretched over the edges of the altar like on the
corners You can see a similar grin across the
center Its all blood splattered from the hearts
that were placed on there As you wipe a little
bit of it away you can see stained into this
loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the
jagged smile The jagged teeth that form a grin
that the various tanned banners that are stapled
into the stone walls show and reveal But no
notes No books no parchment
 Youve already made a religion check before
and as you come up and join her this particular
symbol the grin matches the memory the flash you
had of this entity
 You gather this is probably the symbol
that represents this entity
 You take a few minutes to look around which
gives you two notifications One nothing seems to
be immediately coming in to search as to what the
noises were and you do hear other distant sounds
Impacts and cackling and stuff You get the sense
that the tunnels deeper in have some activity
amongst the gnolls that live below whatever
theyve converted this mine network to be You
also see that all the bodies in this chamber have
been pretty much picked of any identifiable facets
 If you want to take some time to really pick
through it you could try Do you want to
 Thats up to you
 Its about an hour or so
 Not for her it doesnt 
Conservation
 Its more of a tool sledgehammer than a
weapon sledgehammer
 Nothing that caught your attention
 If you were to take about ten more minutes
youd stop being drunk
 Okay so you want to wait until Nott shakes
off the
 The influence the booze Eventually you
regain
 Yes
 That was it yeah
 As you guys are having this conversation
you hear one sound that varies very strongly from
the others that have encompassed this tunnel
sequence You hear this female scream this
highpitched shrieking scream that says No My
baby
 You guys rush down the tunnel deeper into
the maze of mineshafts
 And well pick up on that next week
 Also babies
 Oh god So its actually briney pickled
gnoll ears
 Thats true
 Yeah there you go
 Yeah itll be an interesting interesting
learning process of conservation of spells as you
progress down
 I know Thats okay Thats what cantrips
are for Thats what weapons are for
 Thats what Im saying something to keep
as you continue forward if you need to assault
things All right Oh quick announcement which is
fun so were going to have a guest next week

excited to have him next week In the interim
guys have a wonderful week we love you thank
you for joining us and is it Thursday yet Good night
 Welcome back Last we left off
 The group of
adventures in seeking a warband of gnolls which
had attacked the city of Alfield they were passing
through on their way to Zadash Began to track
them as to where they had retrieved a number of
bodies both dead and living of the civilians of
the town and taken them with them You eventually
track them to an abandoned mine a number of miles
away from the city to the northeast You entered
narrowly missed a trap or two managed to recover
a couple of interesting items delved off to the
left side during the first divide of pathways and
came upon some sort of small ritual with a number
of gnolls and some humanoid figure wearing bits of
gnoll as an armor or cloak Doing a ritual after
he had left along with the previously armored
gnoll that you had battled during the incursion at
Alfield You tore into a number of hyenas and
gnolls that remained within the chamber and upon
defeating them took a moment to take a breath
get your bearings before hearing a muffled boom in
the distance some sort a low vocalization some
cackling and eventually the scream of a woman
saying No my baby You began to run and give
chase That is where were picking up this week
Grabbing your weapons and keeping your mettle
about you you charge further down the tunnel The
shaft curves to the right in a wide spiral about a
few dozen there we go What was that
 Its okay
 Boom
 The tunnel continues in a wide spiral before
eventually snaking a bit

 before sharply turning to the right The
tunnel straightens out before emerging into a
chamber of goddamn it guys this is serious
Lives are at stake here Okay

 The tunnel straightens out before emerging
into a chamber of mixed natural rock walls and
simple stone work Two other tunnels mark this
chamber as a Y intersection or like a second
common room Similar to the one you that you
originally encountered when you entered the mine
Tables and stools are strewn about the area with
a pair of hyenas currently picking at junk for
scraps You see bits of meat that are being
dragged across the ground by them about  feet
off to the left Two thick natural pillars of rock
currently stand as load bearing portions of the
chamber breaking the open space while a crumpled
section of the floor drops into a pit below Two
closed doors to the left of where youre looking
into it are guarded by a skeletal gnoll and two
standard gnoll warriors one of which has
apparently pulled a small child from one of the
doors The sound of muffled cries coming from
beyond the closed door Four other gnolls rush
from within the chamber into the right tunnel
exiting on the opposite side What do you guys
do
 You watch as four of them rush into the
other exit Theres an exit to the left and an
exit to the right They exit the room to the right
gnolls
 and then one skeletal gnoll and then two
hyenas that are currently picking at scraps You
can see as the gnoll pulls the child out is
currently in the process of crying and theyre
both looking at each other like still holding
the child by the arm essentially but currently
is bickering with the other gnoll
 Let me go ahead and give you a visual
 You guys are entering from this side
 Yep
 Essentially over here You can place
yourselves as you feel necessary Off to this
side in whichever marching order you prefer
 I figured as much
 At first glance its hard to see
especially for those of you who are keeping their
light low because there is no light source in the
chamber Those with dark vision will be making out
most of the details here
 All right that would put Fjord up at the
front
 Okay
 Given this you guys are deciding what to
do Theres in a brief moment of quiet a loud
boom that shakes the interior of the chamber You
watch as both the hyenas  look up scared
The two gnolls immediately look about Dust and
rocks begin to settle and fall from the ceiling as
it shakes and then comes to rest A moment later
a cloud of dust and smoke comes billowing out this
side of the chamber where the four gnolls had run
previously Then the rumbling settles The gnolls
themselves are spooked Then distracted from the
child at the moment both peeking over the undead
gnoll stands there glancing about seeming
unaffected by the current scenario Passive
perception the highest on this would be
Beauregard Caleb Molly and Jester I believe
Actually Caleb and Beauregard would not because
they dont see anything You guys hear sounds and
youre waiting for any inclination of light to
kick in
 You guys see the faint appearance of some
sort of a flying creature very small emerge from
the tunnel that had recently expelled all this
dust and smoke
 Frumpkin size  It hovers in the
air in a few places and then locks itself over
here onto this far wall on a higher perch
  Another moment passes and the
gnolls relax You watch as the immediate dread of
the recent explosion sound the shocking and
rocking of the room seems to have passed over
them They both go back to paying attention to
their recent vicinity which includes the small
child which is still quietly sobbing in the
painful grasp of this large curled gnoll hand
 All right The ones who are making the
initial strike on this
 Caleb you dont see anything
 The ones who can see in the dark right now
which would be the four of you you guys get a
round of attack on this
 Where youre currently positioned I would
like you all to roll initiative before we get to
your round just so we have it
 Not so much
 All righty So
 No thats worn off
  to 
 All right  to 
 Shes missing the initial round
 Correct This is just general combat
 Thats true Sorry about that Thats okay
  to ten
 That leaves you rolled a what
 Nott youre up first
 You feel the tension rising and youre like
Ill follow their lead
 That means youre holding your action
 Yeah You can see whats out there you just
dont notice the bird
 If they dont know youre there which this
is currently whats considered an ambush round
you still have advantage on your first strike if
theyre not aware of your presence Which means it
would cancel out that disadvantage
 You can yes
 All right
 That hits You do not get sneak attack on
this because you do not have advantage on the
strike
 You had advantage but you have disadvantage
because theyre beyond the
 You could try it
 Youve been stealthed as you crept up on
this from the last time so go for it
 You already hit on that
 Now you get a sneak attack go for it
 Not bad either
 As its holding the child and its looking
down at the young boy lifting it off the ground
and bringing it towards its jaws as its teeth open
wide its lips curl back like its ready to take a
quick little nibble of the childs arm Suddenly
the bolt hits it in the side of the jaw and its
sticking out  It starts looking
over in your direction and it looks right towards
you 
 No its your full movement to get there
Bonus action you can dash if you want to
 Over here
 That works fine there Beau
 Sorry Beau you lose your turn Its been a
long day Im sorry Molly youre up next
 It is yes
 Over here
 Okay Same roll puts him at a two natural
roll so hes affected by it
 All right and he has disadvantage on his
next attack roll
 The skeletal gnoll turns to you 
It seems to hear it and theres something about
the speech and the connection to this entity that
cause it to shudder for a moment That ends your
turn
 Next up is Beau Wait no Sorry Thats my
problem I wrote Beau twice on this
 Jester and then you
 Okay Toll the Dead to which one
 All righty Constitution saving throw
 That is going to put him at a 
 Sorry As it seems to ring within its head
the impact of the necromantic magic currently
still reeling from the pain in the throat from the
bolt it seems to shrug it off unaffected Then
Fjord youre up
 Right there
 All righty
 Go for it Roll for the attack
 Yeah that hits Go ahead and roll damage
  points of damage all right As its
standing on this upper portion of the rock floor
it glances back as you guys enter You guys see a
flash of light from the arcing of the arcane
energy as it streaks across and slams into its
body just in time to see another shadowed shape
emerging out of this tunnel to join the fray As
it falls back  Thats going
to end the initial round of combat Now were into
the initiative order At the top of this you guys
glance over and the four of you at least see
this shape begin to emerge from around the wall
You see this tall spindly humanoid figure that
begins to curve around the side Khary if you
want to join the table

 If I can have you roll initiative when you
get settled in there
 You having succeeded at some of your other
business begin to creep further into these
tunnels and suddenly see a cluster of unidentified
individuals rushing in here and attacking these
gnolls in front of you and the surprise of it
apparently puts you off for the moment
 Well come to you in just a moment Good to
know At the top of the combat round Nott youre
up first
 The surprise round The humans cant see
anything unfortunately Everything youll be
doing will be at disadvantage after this point
 Around here
 Back over here
 Go for it
 No because youre not hidden
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points of damage Thatll do it
actually As its holding the child and lifting it
up by the arm in the air it looks like its ready
to run away and grab it with it As it turns to
flee you catch it in the base of the skull and it
falls to the ground The child falls prone onto
the floor next to the now lifeless gnoll body
 It looks to be a young boy probably between
six and eight years old Youre not quite sure of
the age
 You havent got a strong bead on it but he
looks to be humanoid
 Around that age group youd assume
  and then you can use your bonus action
to dash if you want to
 Thatll do it You can get right to the
little boy
 As you run up the little boys like
 Just starts screaming bloody murder in
the tunnel

  He starts crying even louder
somehow scared of you more than the gnoll

 Thats your turn Nott Beau youre up
Youre hearing all these sounds but you cant see
anything
 You cant move in there if you hold your
action but you can move in and then hold your
action if you want to Youre just not quite sure
where youre walking
 Hes easy to see because Molly has this
faint luminous glow around the sword from his
right You see that as a beacon Youre like
That I know that I can follow You cozy up
right next to Molly and carefully prepare
yourself
 What action are you holding If any
 Correct
 Okay Dodge action Youre just being
careful All right ending Beaus turn Molly
youre up again
 Okay
 Go for it Do you want to be on the higher
ground here or
 Yeah you can
 And your offhand
  does hit
 Good to know End of Mollys turn Jester
youre up
 Yeah hes been damaged yes
 All right That is a 
 Sorry As you try and release the energy
once more it cant quite get a bead on the
gnolls head Its moving around and dodging and
you cant focus on it
 Okay As youre fussing with this side
thats the end of your turn All right Caleb
youre up
 The chamber erupts into bright light like
theres four torches now lifting brightly at the
entire space
 Bright visuals there you can now see the
child on the ground being scared shitless by the
goblin trying to help The undead gnoll thats
currently locked in combat with Molly You see the
two hyenas that are both snarling and getting
ready to pounce on whoever comes too close The
one wounded gnoll over there As well as if youd
like to describe yourself

 Yes So
first of all
 Caleb do you wish to move
 Caleb do you wish to move
 All right Fjord and the gnoll going at the
same time What are you doing
 As this gnoll here has taken the impact is
going to rush over towards Mollymauk to attempt to
take a strike While another gnoll whos bloodied
and partially crushed is now hobbling its way up
out of this tunnel and spins around to see you up
against the side of the wall 
All right Fjord
 That hits The gnolls going to be striking
you Thats a three thats not going to happen
No
 All right The reason it misses is right as
it swings towards you Fjord raises the back of
the sword and fires a blast of eldritch energy
that hits the back of the gnolls shoulder as it
tries to spin and strike you As it does it goes
wide It pirouettes on its foot and stumbles back
into the open hole 
 Yeah
 Youre a ways away Its hard to see
 Described your initial description of the
room though so now you know As you who has not
given your name yet but you turn around and see
this gnoll as it looks towards you Its leaning
towards normally it would be sevenfoot but
its hunched and wounded and as it turns down it
snarls Takes its spear and attempts to pin you to
the wall a bit Thats going to be a  Whats
your armor class
  It does not hit
 As it swings you push out of the way in
time parrying it with your hand and your cane off
to the side and it smacks into the stone and
sparks off of it for a second hitting flint All
right that ends the gnolls turn The hyenas go
Both of these hyenas now turning around and
seeing whats happening are going to rush forward
This one is going to run up alongside and attack
Molly This one is going to rush over to Nott
 Attacking Molly thats going to be a  to
hit
 All right Its going to be
 two points of piercing damage As it snaps
up and bites the edge of your foot you have to
kick and shake it off on the rocks to get it to
let go The one thats striking towards you Nott
thats going to be an  to hit
 You take only one point of piercing damage
It gets one little bite on the side of your elbow
and you immediately pull away and kick it
instinctually in the chin going  The kid
is now freaking out of his mind as now theres
from his perspective two snarling beasts
cornering in Thats going to end the hyenas
turn All right Your go
me
 Yeah its right up against you
push him away
 If you feel the need yeah
 Certainly
 Is that a wisdom saving throw or
constitution
 That is a three A natural two plus
actually plus zero So two
 Yeah that fails
  I believe All right cool Go ahead and
roll the damage of that
 Well it should say it on the spell there
  points of damage As you turn towards it
describe what you do with your spell as the gnoll
pulls back with its spear
times
  As the third one hits
theres a burst of energy forward You watch as
the gnoll gets blown back slamming into the stone
wall and falls back to its knees before getting
itself up It was previously wounded now its on
deaths door It looks like its starting to
hobble and try and flee
 Do you wish to move
gentleman that I just knocked against a wall and
how about we take a perch on top of there we go
baby
 That finishes your turn At the top Nott
youre up
 Okay What is the spell save on that
 Oh its a spell melee attack So go and
roll
 No You try and reach out but the snout is
too slobbery and your hand slips off of it and it
discharges the spell having no effect
 
 All right
 Yeah
 There is an overturned table Yeah these
are overturned tables over here
 Oh right next to you Yeah youre right
Right there
 You can yeah
 As you drag the child away while youve
disengaged you pull the child out of the range of
the hyena and it sees the opening and snaps out
towards
 
 The hyena bites down and its jaws clamp into
the childs clavicle and chest You hear this
clenched scream thats immediately muffled as you
watch a bit of blood begin to pour out of the side
of his mouth As you pull the child from its jaws
the child is alive For now Unconscious and
bleeding out

 That ends your turn Nott Beau youre up
 Putting you there easy enough
 Roll some damage
 Thats enough to do it As you kick the
hyena gets launched and arc through the air
slamming into this table which busts it up against
the wall onto its side and you cant even see the
lifeless body of the hyena Its currently buried
beneath the overturned table Thats your first
 Its an action to use a healers kit
unfortunately You still have some movement
 Okay so you get down with Nott at this
point and youre trying to think of some way to
apply pressure to prevent the bleeding Okay that
ends your turn That brings us to Molly
 Thats right I forgot to put the undead guy
on the initiative order which he would have gotten
a round Well say you and him go simultaneously
at this point since you engaged him
 Thats a  to hit you Whats your armor
class
 Yeah even as it goes to strike at you with
some sort of rusted battleaxe you still manage to
lift your foot out of the way and strike down
towards it
 Thats adding your wisdom modifier
 Thatll do it You shatter it with a strike
As it attempts to swing towards you with the axe
you duck out of the way spin around and backhand
it with your right enchanted scimitar watching
the bones  explode and scatter across the
ground Like so many pebbles being thrown across
the floor
 Go for it
 That hits Roll damage
 Yeah you do
 It gets down and jumps to pounce towards you
and you lean back and kick it and it tumbles down
to the darkness below You wish to move
 Here
 Gotcha That ends your go Molly That
brings us to Jester
 You wouldve yes
 Are you going to healers kit Cure Wounds
what are you doing
 You dont have to make a check for that You
get down and start pulling heavy rolls of soft
cotton fabric and various balms to help treat the
wound and help staunch the flow of blood and bind
the child to the point where its no longer on
deaths door
 Perfect that ends Jesters turn Caleb
youre up
 Right there you can barely see the one
across the way thats on the ground getting up
 Okay
 Caleb needs glasses
 That ends Calebs turn
 The gnolls been wounded It is going to
take a
 Hes going to take a longbow off its and
looking over and seeing the Fire Bolt that almost
struck it its going to spin back towards you and
pull and arrow Its going to take a shot at you
from across the way Caleb
 This one remaining wounded gnoll is going to
take a shot at you with its longbow Just checking
real fast
 Yeah sure Youre well within its first
range increment
 Thats a natural 
 However
 Oh thats good actually He rolled a one on
the weapon die It was a d it could have been a
 Two plus two four points of piercing damage
That could have been a lot worse
 The gnoll released the arrow As it hits you
in the stomach it comes piercing out the other
side pinning your jacket to you torso You feel
like the pain and the warm pulse up your back from
the wound Its almost numb at first and then you
feel the shock hit you as the gnoll turns and runs
this way
 And hes way over there
Thats going to ends the gnolls turn while
youre going Fjord Because youre going in the
same round as this is happening so you
technically could intercept
 The Hex is on him
 A   hits actually You needed a  to
hit
 As it turns with its bow Fjord runs around
Holding your sword out another burst of eldritch
energy smacks into the back of the gnoll You hear
 as it falls to the ground and slow
bits of curling green and blue eldritch flame
begin to burn and consume the corpse before
eventually it goes out leaving most of the body
intact Its back shoulder blades now a black cave
where its body once was
 That being the case the combat has come to
an end
 Correct Theyre sets of ears Theres the
one there and then the one that was killed there
 Perhaps The child is wounded but the
childs wounds have been tended to Hes
unconscious but is no longer in immediate danger
of dying Hell eventually need rest
 Perhaps some doughnuts
  Hes generally pretty forthright in
speech charismatic figure you dont get any
sense of any immediate lying or conflict to the
words hes saying Youre also not getting a full
read either
 Quite handsome If youd like to describe
how handsome you are
 As your lights begin to slowly drift down
into the hole they get about  or  feet down
before you begin to see the bottom of the shaft It
looks to have been an intentionally created
welllike hole that has since seen disuse
Currently ends into rocks and rubble
 You see the broken body of a gnoll and the
broken body of a hyena down at the bottom of it
 The most youve been down was the opposite
side of this tunnel here There was a group up
here where you had been working with previously
but only recently decided to delve deeper once you
had made sure that those few were safe
job of taking care of the other tentacle of this
cavern I guess youd say
 Make an investigation check
 Best you can tell it doesnt appear to be
trapped It does have a simple latch that is only
accessible from the outer side but it is not
locked
 A moment passes Theres no response but
you hear the faint sniffing and whimpering of
somebody on the other side
 You lift the small latch and pull the door
open First it hits you a strong smell of decay
You see the back of this room is filled with piles
of bodies or parts of bodies It looks to be maybe
four people in total that have been placed here
Then theres one living woman in her midthirties
or so who is wearing a dirtied apron Shes
covered in dirt A spatter of blood you dont
know if its from her or not Her hair is ratted
She looks to be human Shes currently huddled
with her knees to her chest and theres tear
streaks down her face
 Yeah As you open the door you watch as
Shakste begins to approach and take the space
chin so that she looks me in the eye and I tell
her shh What does that make her feel
 You watch as theres a brief moment of
confusion and then an expression of
acknowledgement comes across her face She reaches
up and takes your hand She goes Thank you
Thank you
 She turns around and she goes Oh my god
She runs over to him and immediately picks him up
into her arms and begins to hold him
  Thank you Thank you Shes
rocking the child in her arms quietly rubbing his
face and wiping a bit of blood off of his cheeks
 There are a few I havent seen but Ive
heard voices across the way and they took a
number deeper in before they locked me in
 You unlatch it You watch as the mother
whos currently running her fingers over the hair
of the boy says Jules its okay Its okay
Jules She pulls him in The other door as you
open it a familiar sight It looks like theres
three bodies in here These bodies seem to be
placed in here for some sort of storage for the
time being There is one figure you can see a man
in his older years Halfelven in appearance his
features are a little sharper a little more
elven but not fully His hair is darkbrown
black to gray and salt and pepper on the sides
He looks as disheveled as the woman you just
uncovered
 Hes alive
 Im the only one
 You get up and you can see now theres a
large claw gash across his midsection that might
be infected
 Who are you
 I mean He points back and says I dont
know most of these folks I was just passing
through We were bringing some of our armorwares
up to Zadash when we were waylaid on the road
 Oh we were taken on the way to Alfield We
were almost there They hit us right as they were
reaching the city We had no chance
 We were just arriving in Alfield when it
hit
 Youre telling me
 The woman has come up once again to
up on the surface
 That tunnels not operational
two ways out here I see
 You have this way which appears to go
deeper into the mine
 This way which backtracks where you guys
come from
 Not too long maybe  or so minutes back to
the surface
 One after another you take the remainders
of the previous battle and roll them into the hole
in the center
 You can search if you want to
 You could drag two
 Because youre pretty strong you could drag
two bodies
 Everybody else can take one each I think
based on your strengths You can take none
 All right so two of you can make
investigation checks on this one
 If hes assisting you yeah
 In a quick glance through a lot of it
appears to be pickaxes shovels Most in here
seems to be tools and anything of worth has been
ravaged or taken You find a few bits of rotted
meat of indeterminate origin that you immediately
shrink away from
 Okay There you go
 Nothing in this chamber unfortunately This
one has either been picked clean or didnt contain
anything of immediate worth in the process
 I mean there are plenty of bodies you could
rummage through if you wanted to but
 You can make an investigation check if
youd like
 Roll a d and add your investigation skill
bonus
  as well All right so Not in this
chamber in particular but as you guys are going
through the other tunnel you glance over in one
of the overturned boxes and you find another
familiar object one of which you had used
previously Another singular stick with a long
explosive wick on the end You have another piece
with you
 As he says that and turns you watch as the
small black hummingbird perches on his shoulder as
he continues to walk
 Ill have you all You cant make stealth
checks Youre dragging bodies Whos carrying
how many bodies are you bringing back
 Thats four five six seven
 Make a perception check for me
 Okay You guys carefully make your way back
up through trying not to drag the bodies over
heavy bumps or rocks eventually making your way
out of the main entrance way You notice a trap
that you had deftly avoided multiple times getting
people in and out of a large tree trunk that had
been suspended in the roof to swing down when
triggered had been triggered and is now hanging
there Apparently somebody made an unfortunate
mistake making their way through You all
eventually find your way out into the daylight
once more The woman whos now introduced herself
as Herma and the older halfelf man Petrov all
step out into the light blinking bleary in the
sudden influx of light As soon as you make it
into the open sky you can see this breath of
relief wash over both of them and the young boy
is now starting to come to consciousness again
Goes Mom She goes Shh Its okay its
okay She looks up over towards Shakste and has
more tears in her eyes and goes Thank you
 Thank you all so much You lead them over
through the hills here that cluster around where
this mine once was around the corner there
appears to be a shed thats been long abandoned
and locked up As you approach you have been here
previously
 Is that you
 The door opens and there you can see
emerging four survivors also from Alfield that
with bright eyes welcome the arrival of this
strange traveler as well as the three other
survivors youve brought in As some of them begin
to reunite with people that are familiar to them
people who live in Alfield and know each other
they begin to hold each other and take a moment to
relish in this renewed moment of life Then they
begin to pour over the bodies that have been
recovered and they begin to identify them to each
other and then sadness takes over Then once
those waves have passed individuals begin to go
up and thank you and take your hand and a few of
them are like Anything I can give you please
just let me know Thank you so much Its a lot
to have at once and for many of you an experience
that is different and new Take it as you will
however you wish to but you also know time is of
the essence and not too much time can be spent on
this
 All the bodies are placed in a small pile
and a large heavy piece of canvas material is
placed over them to hide them The shed is closed
and locked and they all seem to feel at least
for the moment comfort and safety in this space
as you all begin to delve once more into the mines
beneath the hills I would like you all to make a
stealth check please as you progress further in
 Universally you guys are all confident in
your ability to delve without being seen even
making up for those who maybe not have been a less
bumbling experience making their way in
 You make your way back through the familiar
tunnel and you can now see that the right tunnel
the one that you had previously seen the pitfall
and decided to not head down into is now a large
cluster of rock and rubble
 You progress down through the ritual area
carefully avoiding a scattering of metallic ball
bearings across the floor You see an altar with
candles on it that have all burned down entirely
except for a few tiny flickers Is there any light
source you guys are bringing down here with you
 All right the balls of light now float as
you progress giving everyone who needs it sight
You head down into the familiar chamber where this
last fray occurred carefully avoiding the large
hole in the ground This is the only other exit
from this chamber You continue forward Whos
taking point and what is the marching order
please
 You may
 As you take a moment to continue focusing
as you do through the vision of your bird
 coasts down through the tunnel
before you to keep an eye out
Make a perception check for your bird please
Roll a d and add two to it
  nice The birds perception not his
 Thats great The tunnel descends at a
moderate grade for about  to  feet before it
levels off once more Ahead you see a set of
rough stairs that rise for about five or six feet
leading to the remainder of the tunnel and then
curving to the left suddenly out of sight
slightly along this elevation Right there you
have your bird  and right as the
stairs ascend and turn immediately there is the
outer corner of a gnoll stands there
waiting keeping watch  Do you
want to send your bird in further to check out the
rest of the room or pull it back
 Shes pretty quick
 All right  Okay
 As the Duchess moves further and up to the
platform the Duchess can see another portion of
the floor that is collapsed inward into another
falling pit that rests against the wall on the
opposite side of where these stairs ascend The
tunnel curves to the left immediately where this
hole is on the top and where it continues down
there appears to be a large archway where there
was once a set of double doors The doors have
been broken off the hinges and are not visible at
current sight but to each side of the frame you
can see two skeletal gnolls with bits of flesh and
skin hanging off their bones and rib cage and
snout sitting there like silent undead sentinels
looking around
  Charging back to the tunnel
back to your shoulder
Hes by himself but yeah theres just the one
Beyond him there is more to deal with I think we
quietly take care of this gentleman first and
then we move on
 Down along to the grade ball bearing
bouncing Eventually you can no longer hear any
noise the ball bearing makes as it continues out
of your earshot
 Okay A minute passes Two minutes
You dont see any indication that anything noticed
or heard
 You may if you are going to try to stealth
it
 All right so make your stealth check and
add a d to whatever you roll
 Plus the d
 Not good
  Okay Its just Nott Youre going as
well
 The two of you begin to make your way down
the hall carefully ever so carefully about  or
 feet towards the bottom where you can both see
the grade begin to turn up Fjord you discover
why you stopped hearing the ball bearing as
suddenly you take a step and your foot slides up
from under you
 You try and catch yourself and you manage to
do so but you dislodge a rock that begins making
more noise than the ball bearing did At which
point you hear 
 Its down below the grade and out of sight
Its just the rock that began to make its way down
 Okay So
 You do take a heavy swig off of your flask
thank you Both wait carefully holding your action
until underneath you can see what emerges below
the lowest part of the curving tunnel roof a
gnoll snout begins to protrude past You can see
the arrow already nocked in the longbow as it
turns down and turns and glances up the tunnel to
meet your guys vision
 Right now hes about  feet below you
 Go ahead and roll an attack
 Yep
 Just hits Misses
 At this point your Hex has faded
 Since you guys hadnt left before
 Yeah had you guys taken a short rest when
you were up there or not
 It would Its up to you guys It may or may
not affect things
 All right so before we jump into this
well say you took the short rest which is an
hour so you guys can use your hit dice You
hadnt taken any damage Shakste so you dont
have to worry about it
I did use the Thunderwave
 That does not come back on a short rest
 Yeah its a long rest for you

 Yes under hit points
 Its under the short rest
 All righty so with that the case youve
taken a short rest Now back to the current
moment You both fired You missed you succeeded
to hit go ahead and roll your damage on that
  points of damage all righty As it looks
up and gets hit in the snout and it looks back up
and you can see the black charred exterior of its
head one of its eyes is now ruined and he
 Its tongue is dangling out You can see
blood and slobber across the front of its chest as
it looks up and gets ready to release its bow
strike at you since you made the hit Thats going
to be a  to hit
 Natural  Thats an eight on the die that
is ten points of piercing damage to you
 Right at this point you guys have now
begun to head down yeah
 You guys head down its going to take the
better part of the turn to get to where they are
unfortunately because you guys were waiting at
the very top As soon as you see the lights go off
suddenly and the impact of the spell from him and
hear the snarling in the distance you guys begin
to make a full beeline and it takes you the full
dash and movement to even get beside your allies
You guys get another round as well as the gnoll
so go ahead and make your attacks
  hits
 Hits Roll damage No sneak attack
unfortunately
 All right Damage on you
 The Guidance only helps for the next six
seconds so it helped him with the stealth check
originally You can do it whenever you want to as
an action
 As the gnoll pulling back its arrows about
to give out a large bellowing cry makes a large
inhale as it pulls back a second arrow and then
both of you slam into it and watch as it falls to
the ground dropping its weapons that clatter
against the stonework Its not longer moving as
you guys catch up
 Okay You drag it back in while youre down
you make perception checks please
 If youre helping yeah both of you
 As you rush down and grab the body you
glance up and whereas previously he described
there was the singular gnoll and the two other
skeletal ones in the opposite side it appears
that since it was given some indication of nearby
sounds and it made that brief call before it began
to approach there are a few more gnolls that have
appeared at the top of the platform above where
the stairs crest
 No they do not at the moment but only
because theyre not looking at your direction As
soon as you see it you immediately drag the body
out of the way I would like you both make a
stealth check to try to quietly drag the body
back
 You both dont drag it you both grab an arm
and a leg and very painfully lift it up without
making any sound and pull it out of range up the
grade out of view as you watch one of the gnolls
turns its face in your direction barely passing
seeing you guys yank it out of sight
 You saw three visually appear
 To give you perspective on this because it
looks like were going on that direction

 You now see
 This leads into the grade that head up in an
angle here where you guys originally shot the
gnoll and dragged him out of the way
 You guys are over
 Youre up in the tunnel here It angles down
there and this is where
 They havent noticed anything yet You guys
are up in this way and this is the layout here
 You may Yeah
 The Grand Duchess makes her way down to the
tunnel up Lets see if they see her
 She passes them over There is one perch up
on the side of the wall right above where this
large pit is on the opposite end She perches
right over the side as two of the gnolls are still
 One of them begins to look over the
table and underneath for any possible source of
the noise earlier One of them glances over his
shoulder as the Duchess enters begins to pull an
arrow out of the quiver
  
 Okay you reduce your max hit points
 Yes please Constitution saving throw
 Six no thats a failure You lose Hex
sorry buddy
 Its pitch black aside from the globes of
light that he has Theres nothing to make
brighter in there
 For that instance make a standard wisdom
check for me Roll a d and add your wisdom
modifier which I think is
 As you feel the Duchess return to you and
just past the vision as the Duchess passes over
you hear the sound of the fingers gliding across
the bowstring You hear the creak of the wood as
its pulled back You know exactly what that sound
means as you see through the Duchesss eyes You
focus on the ground below and cause it to quake
somewhat Rolled a natural five plus four with
that shaking it causes the its very localized
in the area the gnoll  as it does it
releases the arrow and it whips past and shatters
across the rock The Duchess returns to your shoulder
 What are you guys doing
 If this is the case what are you guys
doing
 Theyre aware of something in the vicinity
The first gnoll announced there was something
fishy They dont know what it is or where you
are but theyre on guard
 Its possible
 You may
 As you have this conversation you turn back
and you watch as Fjord the rather handsome
looking halforc finishes muttering something
under his breath and the shadows coalesce into
this dark cold icy armor that shatter into bits
of shards around the exterior of his leather
armor You watch as this mist rises off of it
 This guys moved forward to here This guys
moved forward to there Theyre in the process of
searching the area looking down the tunnel
 You saw them the skeletal ones there
saw them I say I think we need to get those
fellows to turn back and look at those fellows
 You guys are up in this tower right now so
youd have to send Duchess back in to see
 All right on this guy there
 As you guys slowly bring your way to the
base which in order to get you in the space
where you can see them that would put both of you
rushing right down to the base in that area If I
can get a marching order to where the rest of you
are by the way
 You guys rush forward to take the line as
they
 As you all rush in below you both release
Sacred Flame and Toll the Dead on the guy in the
blue Thats a wisdom saving throw for Sacred
Flame I believe it is
 Thats right A wisdom save for you thats
a 
 Yeah it succeeds Sorry For you its 
as well for your DC That is a five
 Sorry

 Roll damage for the Sacred Flame which
should be Whats the damage on the spell
spells damage increases by d when you
 Yeah so its d Go ahead and roll d
radiant damage
 You watch the light burst in
 You cast Blur That all happens in a quick
instant as they rushed forward and you guys caught
up Now were rolling initiative
  to   to  anybody
 All right  to 
  to ten
 Jester you got ten
 Ten to five
 Beau what did you get
 As the gnolls are all clumping together
preparing for your onslaught right at the edge of
the hole with the furniture on the opposite side
there the two skeletal gnolls who are getting
ready to rush into the fray Top of the round is
Shakste
 Okay Against which one
burst into flames this gentleman burst into
flames and when that happened what did these
gentlemen how did these gentlemen react
 The two other gnolls glance over at the
side and then look towards the tunnel where you
guys were It didnt seem like it was much of a
distraction for them unfortunately in the moment
 Unfortunately it wasnt a sourceless
cluster as you guys all made your way to the base
us I will hit with Frostbite
 All right Would that be that one there
 All right go for it Frostbite he has to
roll against your DC so I roll it for you That
is a natural one so go ahead and roll damage on
that
 It should be is that a d for that one as
well
 Okay so it would be d Im pretty sure
its a d for the cantrip
 Three points of cold damage to him and he
has disadvantage on his next attack roll
Suddenly a similar cold to what you saw coalesced
around the armor of Fjord this time its
attacking and freezing inward and you watch as
the gnoll  Its shaking
briefly you watch as its muscles are beginning to
slow down and become sluggish Do you want to
move or do you want to stay where youre put
right behind these fellows
 All right so you stay there That ends your
turn The gnolls will now go The three of them
are going to begin to back away and theyre all
going to take strikes with their bow
 They all pull out their arrows and each are
going to make a strike The one you frostbit is
going to attack you it has disadvantage
 It was a three and a two with disadvantage
so no it misses you entirely It actually gets
partially caught in the fro and makes its way to
the back
Got to be careful
 Missed them all thankfully The next attack
in the front is going to be against Beau and then
ones going to be against Molly since you guys
are the most visually impressive of the front row
colorwise You blend into the surroundings a
little bit comparatively so against Molly Man
they cannot roll that is a six
  Just grinding toothpicks
The one versus you Beau that is a 
 Dodge out of the way
 All right Molly youre up
 There
 Thats a  on the saving throw
 So hes fine unfortunately
 You can keep using your movement if you want
or you can stay put
 Okay Ending your turn Molly its Nott
youre up
  
 Thats that guy there
 Make the attack
  it does hit and then splinters off the
armor Off the ice in particular
  You rush back down That
finishes your turn Nott Jester youre up
 You can see them
 Wheres it going to appear
 Right there
 The one gnoll goes  All right
Seems immediately confused by the appearance of
two Jesters in proximity
 Thats your action Thats your go
 Nah thats as far as you can get with your
movement unfortunately
 Ending Jesters turn These two
guys come into play This one rushes up and swings
at the illusory Jester passes through no effect
This ones going to five six It does not have
a ranged attack so instead its going to rush
forward and engage with you right there
 Its now Beaus go
 It is dark You currently theres a little
bit of light that you have
 Yeah youre seeing action happen up ahead
and youre like  You dont have a good
bead You can still do things but youre considered
blind so you have disadvantage on any
attacks that you make
 Yeah you can hold your action if you want
 Okay All right youre holding your action
You rush up and you can see the outer glimmers of
bits of bone and its body moving as it rushes in
to harry Jester
 No Only your action unfortunately
 You can
 You go into a defensive potion there all
right
 Correct
 That ends your turn Caleb youre up
 Lighting up the vicinity here
 Okay Perfect
 Go for it
 All right so as the light emerges above
you leap into the air swing the staff bring it
straight down as it does
 Yeah It splinters the skeleton into pieces
all around its entire body crushes and collapses
to the ground Scattered across
 Caleb rest of your turn
 Stay where you are all right That finishes
your go The light is in the room The end of
Calebs turn that is now Fjord
  There you go
 There 
 Okay Behind Beau right there
 Ill put you right there Well just lean
you
 There Oh excuse me
 Which one are you shooting at
 Thats the one thats been frosted Go for
it
  for against him does not hit
 Unfortunately It manages to strike some
sort of shield on the side that shatters Its
bolted to its forearm It pulls it up just in time
to deflect the Eldritch Blast It cracks the
shield and does damage to its exterior but no
wound to the actual gnoll
 That finishes Fjord Top of the round you
hear this 
 
 Watch as an armored gnoll
 In the back of the chamber
 Outnumbered and crossbow As the pack lord
approaches cackling at the sight of you you see
a look of recognition on its eyes as it pulls back
its longbow and is going to go ahead and fire
immediately at Well first Im going to see It
does see through the illusion so it does not fire
for the fake Jester however it does fire for
you the actual Jester
 You currently do not have visual
 Not in your current position nope
 So thats an attack on you with a longbow
That is going to be a 
 Doesnt hit you
 It splinters across the shield no impact
Thats going to end its go Were now at the top
of the round Its your turn Shakste
 All righty
 Aid is that ndlevel
 I believe you both get five additional hit
points to your max and five hit points
 Yeah so the three of you your max hit
points go up by five
 You gain five hit points on top of that
 All right as you feel this sudden burst of
physical hardiness surge within this warm glow in
your belly that helps stir you up to the future of
physical impact and damage Thats your action do
you want to move at all on your turn
few feet and Ill also take Anastasia and put her
a little further forward but at a safe distance
from these people
 All right Like this direction or this
direction
we go
 Well put Anastasia perching on the wall
there looking that way
 Okay That ends your turn Its now the
gnolls go This one is going to rush forward
towards you This skeletal one is going to rush
forward towards Jester This ones going to stay
back and continue to fire at Beau Its going to
take a step back there This ones going to stay
where it is and take a shot at Beau as well We
have one gnoll thats attacking you with a spear
Thats a 
 You deflect it with your sickle which
youve unhooked from earlier Just grab it and
 off to the side parrying it The skeletal
witherling rushes up and is going to attempt to
strike at you with a bite actually Its going to
lash out with its horrible bony maw That is
going to be a ten
 You pull the shield up a little higher
Teeth shatter and break and fly off around the
exterior of the shield
 As youre doing that Good job you look
back just as two arrows go flying towards you from
the two other gnolls They both have disadvantage
I believe right Because you took your defensive stance
 All right which is good because that
wouldve been a  and an 
 Well thats the first attack I rolled a 
and  You dodge out of the way The second one
is going to be a  and a 
 That hits
 You take six points of piercing damage
 Reaction right
 Okay Go ahead and roll your die
 Six piercing damage
 All right so the first arrow you dodge out
of the way and the second one you see it coming
out of the way Theres a brief moment where time
seems to  and you catch it right in the
middle of your hand It pulls you back a little
bit and looking down you can see the arrow is
there right in the middle of your grip
 Thats going to end the gnolls go Molly
youre up
 There you go
  hits him
 Only a  armor class
  points of damage is just what you needed
With your first strike infused with the rite you
streak down with your first blow and your scimitar
carves through the upper part of its shoulder
blade into its ribcage As you do you watch as
whatever necrotic energys holding its body
together suddenly dissipates and all the bones
clatter to the ground in a pile
 This one here
  Yes there is
 That hits Roll damage
 You dont get the bonus to your wisdom but
you still have the rite on that one
 Ten points of damage on the other
 Using the momentum of that first strike you
continue running and with a backwards swipe carve
through the back of the other gnoll It arches its
back with pain as you carve this giant wound
across the back of its shoulder to about where the
base of its spine is and you see blood beginning
to flow from its wound where the bits of the armor
are separated and the fur poking out from within
the haphazard hide I believe that ends your
turn
 All righty End of Mollys turn Nott
youre up
 Okay Go for it
  hits and you do get sneak attack because
it is currently
  points of damage Its already taken 
from the rest of you so that finishes it off

 You wait for the moment where Jester moves
out of the way As its pulling back and beginning
to try and strike again with its spear and take
the shot and watch as it hits right in the sternum
and pulls back its spear and with its final thrust
of momentum falls to the ground into a pile and
is now bleeding out of its mouth as its
unconscious and dying on the ground
 Can you cast it as a bonus action
 Meaning you cast it as an action You cant
do that yet
 Make a sleight of hand check I need you to
go ahead and make a perception check
 Roll a d Add your perception skill
modifier
 Yeah you dont notice it
What does he see hanging off the back of
your belt
 Okay Just hanging right there on the back
of the belt
 Thats your action That finishes your turn
Nott Jester youre up
 To which one
 It did It rolled a seven

 Four points of damage All right That was
to which one of these two
 The orange one okay Both of them have been
damaged now a little bit You watch as it shakes
its head for a second and its beginning to
string another arrow That finishes your turn
 He had not been damaged before
 Then roll that eight
 Weirdly more damage
 Well there you go Now hes damaged Good
catch on that That end your turn or do you want
to move Well you moved your oh that was a
bonus action
 All righty
 Thats your turn That brings us to all
no both of the skeletons have been destroyed
Thatll bring us to Beaus turn
 Five ten  which one
 There you go
 Go for it
  does not hit As you rush forward to
swing with your first strike the one thatd been
firing at you from the previous round notices your
approach throws the longbow over the arm and
brings up the shield in the same motion and
deflects the quick thrust of your staff
 If youre doing Flurry of Blows you have two
more attacks on it
 No you do that instead of your bonus
attack You hit once it gets deflected and you
spend your bonus action to do Patient Defense
 Thats all right
 That ends your turn Caleb youre up
 You get just about there
 The one that you saw earlier in Alfield and
that you
  hits
  points of fire damage

 Thats awesome As he turns the corner the
two gnolls back out of the way and you see it
standing there It has its large twohanded glaive
in its hand its shield slung over one shoulder
the bow over the other and seeing this for the
first time you see this larger muscular more
darkfurred gnoll that looks like the leader of
this cluster this pack The armor it has is
chunks of chainmail and hide armor that are
patched together where a number of long thin
spines like heavy bonelike spikes have been
woven into it like a decoration to make it look
extremely intimidating Right as it grins and gets
its glaive ready it gets blasted with three beams
of burning arcane energy as they hit and impact
you watch as the flames curl up and it has to pat
it out with its giant hand  It took the
hit like a champ and it seems like its hurt but
its still doing pretty well
 Is that your turn
 That was a good round That finishes Calebs
turn Fjord youre up
 Well technically youre not prone sorry
 Right there You may Go ahead and roll the
attack
 That hits roll damage
 Eight points of damage That one as its
notching another arrow into its bow it takes the
impact off of its shoulder It grazed it
 You may Well mark him with the Hexblade
Curse with this big old angry black circle to mark
him as the target there
 You may
 That ends Fjords turn Back of the combat
round its now the pack lords turn The pack
lord returns to this way
 No it steps through the one and is going to
turn this way and rear back for a giant kick
Its going to make a shove attack against you
 Yeah thats a big ol pit
 He already has disadvantage because of
Patient Defense
 One and  Whats your armor class
 Oh shit All right so hold on
 It hits Well see with the shove
 Im seeing if theres a contested check we
havent done the shove in a while here
 Im so sorry guys Thats my bad
 Thats my bad
 Oh actually it doesnt have a roll of
attack against you technically so that wouldnt
have mattered Its a contested athletics versus
your
 Versus your athletics or acrobatics your
choice
 Ill check real fast to see if your Patient
Defense affects that at all not sure if it does
 Yeah it doesnt affect this roll
unfortunately Its just a straight roll
 Nope Its a contested roll
 Its a natural 

 You can come look at The Snitch right now
 Make your acrobatics check Its not an
automatic success
 Its a  total It only has a plus three
strength bonus so
 It was almost an  and it went to a four
So He shoves you not actually with the shield
He pulls back and Sparta kicks you Right as you
turn to try and defend whack It hits you right
in the sternum and you get pushed back five feet
which puts you right on the edge I need you to go
ahead and make a dexterity check to try and catch
yourself
 Dexterity saving throw
 Its against attack rolls but I feel like I
just saw something For dodge action and you
make dexterity saving throws with advantage
 You do so roll with advantage
 Its a high DC you have to beat I think
with this and the impact that hit you you have to
beat an  so go for it You have advantage
 You watch as Beau slips cant get a grip
and then falls and tumbles into the pit below
 Thats what she was trying to grab as you
fell back That was the dexterity saving throw
because it was a grate You suffer  points of
bludgeoning damage which its not bad You fell
 feet and landed on your back onto hard rocks
and stones
 Oh yeah
 You have five more hit points than you had
before the battle started
 That ends his go Shakste youre up You
watched Beau fall into this pit behind
 You have four stlevel spells per day you
can cast and two second Youve used one
ndlevel so have one of those and youve cast
Thunderwave before so you still have three
stlevel spells
 Correct You can cast with any of those
Command the big guy
 You could try
 What do you want to Command him to do
 Yeah you can see him the big guy
 Hes within range Hes about  feet from
you
him to fall could I ask him to fall on his fellows
 You cant ask him to fall on somebody elses
weapon You can ask him to drop prone if you want to
 So what do you say as he finishes kicking
Beau into the pit and turns 
 It looks back towards you and I see the
spell DC is  for you That is a two it does not
succeed You watch as it puts its weapons down for
a second and looks right at you eyes wide
confused as it turns its head inquisitive
sound
 Yeah it takes no actions for its next
turn
 Do you want to move or stay where you are
about where I am
 Its the gnolls turn
 Yep These guys are going to back up a
little bit and theyre both going to take shots
one at Molly and one at Jester At Molly that is
a  Whats your armor class
 It hits You take four points of piercing
damage Attacking against you Jester A natural
 Im sorry
 They noticed earlier unfortunately
 Thats okay its not too bad Thats eight
points of piercing damage
 Okay That ends their turn Molly youre up
first
 Go for it
 No he just doesnt make action on his
turn
 He can react but he doesnt He cant take
any actions or move on this turn
 That hits roll damage
 No you dont
  points of damage from that first strike
You carve through the body Its eyes still locked
on  Its eyes are still locked on
Shakste not looking away going 
 That hits Roll damage again for that one
 All right So as you back away
 That way It sees you walk away and makes a
strike towards you
 He does
 Okay Thatll give him disadvantage
 As his eyes go black and you watch him begin
to bleed from the corners of its eyes
 The second roll for that attack was a three
plus five So yeah it misses you its an eight
 Like over here
 Ending Mollys turn Nott youre up
 Yes
 Okay So youre holding that there Ending
your turn Nott Jester youre up
 All right
 So both of you guys make your attack Or
whatever youre doing Jester
  also hits Both of you guys roll damage
  points of damage
 How do you guys want to do this

 Currently held
 As you collide with the gnoll pack lord as
you release a bolt that strikes it in the throat
 The bolt sinks through one of the eyes as
the sickle hits the other and it  and it
tries to make one final thrust before the halt
magic prevents it from doing so and it 
 And falls to the ground
 That was a glaive It was a large twohanded
polearm with an axe head at the end of it
 Its pretty big
 That ends Jesters turn That brings us to
Beau
 Youre like  You get up from
prone so its half your movement
 It is a small enough space Ill let you
make an athletics check or acrobatics check
instead of athletics
 It is not small enough for that
unfortunately Its about a ten foot gap but you
can leap from side to side or you can climb with
athletics Its your choice
 Thats acrobatics to do that
 Its monkish Go for it
 You leap leap leap leap You get about 
feet up your movement before you have to grab onto
the wall to stop yourself
 Thats fine Still enough And if you wanted
to use an action to dash you could make it the
rest of the way up
 Pole vaulting off parkouring up the wall
until eventually you leap and get back up to the top
 Yep
 Ending Beaus turn Caleb youre up
 Right there All right roll for the
attack
  hits Roll damage
 Eight points of damage It impacts and it
looks like really hurt now and its like heavy
breathing Its getting ready to run It looks
like its in the process of deciding to flee
 Finishing Calebs turn Fjord youre up
 There you go
 Go for it Roll to attack
 That hits Roll damage
 That one seeing the other one about to
flee tries to turn to meet gait right before your
Eldritch Blast slams it in the back and core
through its abdomen leaving this burning hole in
the center before it falls to the ground and
collapses dead Its friend going 
Its now looking scared and ready to bolt That
ends Fjords turn
 Pack lords gone Shakste youre up There
is this one whos very wounded and about to flee
with Sacred Flame
 All righty That is a natural four It does
not succeed so roll damage on that one d radiant
damage
 Six points of damage Thats aw man
almost As it bursts into flame its body is now
singed by the radiant energy thats burned around
its torso Its breathing heavy and limping and
its going to go ahead and is that the end of
your turn
great question
 Thats your movement your action so
there some
 If you have anything that could use a bonus
action
a bonus action
 You have a spell that does it but I dont
think its going to be helpful right now
 Yeah hold off on that Okay so that ends
your turn Its going to turn and bolt It was
right up against you so you do get an attack of
opportunity on it
 Roll damage
 As it spins to run away youre like No you
dont  and slam it on the head It falls
 Again You just slowly bash it to the
ground until its heads a mashedin pulp

 Yeah you can pull the ears out There a
little wet but theyre functional
 All right well come back and begin that
right after we take a quick break So were going

 You guys finishing this fray you gather
the gnoll ears as well as
 Make an investigation check The two of you
who are investigating their bodies
 Okay
 Aw
 Okay Well theres the glaive Its hard to
miss that Its pretty wellmade its sturdy it
has some of the spines that are part of the armor
as well affixed to it along the top
 Its like Let me look at how much a glaive
weighs according to the book The glaive is about
six pounds Its not too bad Well this ones
probably closer to ten Its a pretty topheavy
Its designed for a gnoll Or at least designed
for something big that wants to hurt something
badly You do manage through a collection of
shinies in the pack leaders pockets and manage to
find roughly  gold pieces three silver and no
copper It only wants things that are shiny
Copper arent as shiny to them
 Mmhmm Shakste
 Where does Shakste put the gold
 You can do it discreetly if you want to
gold in his back pocket pretty discreetly
actually He doesnt have to look at it
 Make a stealth check Or a sleight of hand
check
 Plus whats your sleight of hand skill
 So  Make a perception check
 Yeah so you have no idea He receives the
gold and the hand disappears beneath the cloak
which is now covering most of his torso and you
have no idea where it got put
 Two silver
Anastasia notice her looking at me
 I mean no more than anybody looks at
anybody
 The little goblin girl isnt leering at you
I mean has been leering at you since you arrived
but nothing in a way that catches your attention
Nice to know
 Make an insight check Roll a d and add
your insight skill
three so eh
 Its a  Id say yeah No more than
usual
 As you guys get closer to the exit where
this broken hinged archway was this double door
archway about eight to ten feet wide a new smell
rushes into your nose Whereas previously it had
been just decaying earth and dust theres now this
musky smell that resembles the faint mixture of
urine and citrus Its hard to place but its new
and its different than the rest of the mines
youve been through
  You watch at the Duchess makes her
way further down the tunnel
 You feel this tiny goblin hand push on you
There does not seem to be a reaction
 As youre focused currently to the vision of
your you do not sense
 You do not because currently all of your
senses are through your familiar So unfortunately no
 You will have to so make a sleight of hand
check
  Nobody has a passive perception higher
than a  I think
 All right
 Go ahead and mark nine gold pieces off of
your total and you take nine gold
 The whole pouch
wouldnt feel the entire pouch being pulled off of my
 You dont unfortunately because your
senses Well wait no its sight and hearing
isnt it
 Thats right I take it back He didnt
react to you being touched earlier but I need you
to go ahead and make a perception check
 Plus what is your perception skill
 After the initial pat you were focused it
didnt bother much You feel your belt tug a bit
and you feel suddenly the back of your armor begin
to get a little lighter as your pouch is
noticeably being removed from your person
 No
 Its happening
 I mean he can if he chooses too
 Shakste do you want to do anything
 You undo the pouch and now have it in your
possession As youre focusing through the
Duchesss vision beyond the broken doorway the
tunnel grows rougher as you sense that the deeper
shafts of the mines are coming to an end fairly
soon The scent the Duchess is picking up is
strong that weird musky smell After about 
feet of it snaking a little bit forward through
ten  foot wide tunnels suddenly the tunnel
opens into a large rocky alcove formation
stalactites from the ceiling and some elements of
broken digging equipment around the corners of
this chamber The uneven ceilings stand about 
to  feet tall within in places and are scarred
with pick marks from various attempts to meet the
end of the mine which apparently were not enough
to keep the mine in business A rough slope
descends from the immediate entrance to this
tunnel hits the wall before it rises a few feet
past that to a smaller platform that meets the
opposite side of the wall about  or  feet to
the other side The chambers about foot from
where you enter to the opposite end Near the base
of the raised rock you see two humanoid figures
sitting against each other bound tightly in ropes
and above the platform on top you see a figure
you havent seen yet Humanlike but seems to
have large chunks of gnoll flesh strapped to their
body like they used a disembodied gnoll arm as a
glove a gnoll head with the jaw removed and
hollowed out used as a hood There is this
individual carrying baubles and chains of some
symbols across their neck and theyre spattered
with blood Theyre standing at the top currently
holding a third humanoid figure who is bound in
ropes and dragging them up the stairs to this
platform on the opposite end Next to this
gnollwearing priestlylike figure you see the
figure in their arm is a guard one of the
Crownsguard of Alfield You dont recognize him at
a glance but you can see they are currently still
living bloodied and are being dragged up to the
top of this platform You can see right at the top
of this raised section a monstrous mound of broken
wood rope burlap and scrap from nearby within
the mine that has been amassed into this large
pile At that moment a majority of the mound
begins to move and shift as two large brown red
leathery wings unfurl from the mound Where a
furcovered body steps out Is the Duchess going
to stay and continue to watch
sees
 You can You are describing this verbally to
everybody
 This creature stands up from within this
pile you can now see this large lionlike body
and torso the size of a rhinoceros massive and
muscled with giant clawed paws Around the neck
you see this thick red fiery mane of hair and a
humanoid female face dark and tanned with this
large curled grin The mouth that opens and hangs
with rows of sharp teeth but weirdly humanoid in
appearance It turns its head towards this
priestly figure who thrusts the guard to the
front and says Come gifted mother Feed and may
you grow strong Your strength is a boon from
Yeenoghu and one that will bring us much more
meat in the time to come and kicks the guard
forward This large beast turns and inspects the
frightened shaking and sobbing guard Your god
meats hold me to nothing but your offer pleases
me and my child As the beast stands up further
in this pile of rough found pieces of wood and
twine a small infant of its same species seems to
be wound up and begins to mewl in its place Its
pawing at the air its eyes not even freshly
opened This creature steps forward and bites into
the Crownsguard and lifts it up as he begins to
scream The rest of you hear the echoing screaming
in the distance of the Crownsguard
 As it begins to bite and crunch pulling its
jaw open it tears it into two halves and begins
to chew on the upper torso The screaming has
stopped
 There are two people left in the room and
you can look around the vicinity It looks like
there were more people in here that have probably
been fed over the past hour
come back to me
 Thankfully nobody seems to notice Duchesss
presence as Duchess retracts back into your chamber
 Its past  feet of tunnel before it opens
up into the chamber which is another  feet from
the entrance
 To give you a visual
 So you can prepare
 No holes in the chamber from what you can
see
 Yeah
 Not that you can see no There are various
portions in the ceiling that are stalactites It
looks like its the deepest part of the mine
which is the roughest which means it does not
have a lot of support structure built into it for
the miners This like its as deep as they got
before they abandoned it from the veins dried up
 This mine has been long abandoned The
recent occupants seem to have discovered it and
taken it their own
religion but thats got its limits
 You guys all making an approach
 Roll stealth please
 Yes right there
 All right so marching order please
 What is the marching order
 Nott where are you
 Ill put you in front of Caleb Molly are
you next to Beau
 Theyre conscious theyre just tied up to
each other
 You can certainly try its up to you guys
of noise and call a lot of attention and then
maybe you could sneak through
 You have one ndlevel spell and you have
three stlevel I believe
used Thunderwave and Command
 Thats correct You have two stlevels you
have three spells left
If we start with Spiritual Weapon we lure their
gaze to this side of the area and then if this
beautiful young lady could find her way around
the other side to free the two
 If I can have all of you who are approaching
to make a stealth check please
 Sorry the one you just made Sorry so what
was were those scores
 
 All right Interesting point of order this
human that you see this priest Pitch black sees fine
 Does have a set of as theyve walked into
this chamber although you would have seen this
 Actually yeah Youre the only one who
would notice something You dont see anything
never mind All right so
 You didnt notice anything in particular
other than just seeing this scene Nothing at all
You know nothing So stealth is 
 All right
  What did you roll for stealth check
 Shakste whats your stealth check please

  okay
 Yeah which is good because that means the
rest of the group picked up for you
 As you guys approach those of you who can
see in the dark you cant quite see your quarry
Youd have to get closer in because I believe its
a  foot darkvision radius for most of you guys
Which means you can see to about there
 You can Make a stealth check for your
hummingbird
 Natural one and a four on their perception
Nobody sees your birds arrival
 All right Nott so you rush in
 Yeah and whats the range on that one
  feet so you can keep it out as far as
that Yeah its fine All right so you come in
there Where are you holding the ball bearing
 As that happens you watch as both the
priest and the large beast at this time which
now that were getting closer and were seeing the
form I probably shouldve asked this of you
check
 Both of you guys
 You notice it but you after getting a
closer view of its form as your hummingbird gets
in close you can I know what this is This is a
manticore The wings are scary the teeth are
scary the spines on its tail are scarier
 Youve heard rumors of such things being
flung as a weapon and regrown quickly and begin to
suddenly remember the spines that were affixed to
the armor of the gnoll leader and the glaive You
rush in and have this moment of remembrance as you
begin to curl forward stealthing around the side
as the ball bearing  Both the
priest and the manticore whip over in that
direction The priest pulls a glove on its hand
thats a dull red color that begins to sparkle
and glow at the tips of the fingers and tightens
it on its hand and begins to step down the stairs
a bit in the direction of that
 Over here
 Over here
 Okay Whereas the female manticore
 The wind picks up and dust begins
to spiral and briefly obfuscates the area The
manticore flies with an impact lands on the
opposite side right where the ball bearing is and
 Company All right what are you guys doing
 Make a sleight of hand check from a
distance Well this would be a straight dexterity
check Roll dexterity not sleight of hand
 Add your dexterity modifier
  With a quick rapid movement of your
Mage Hand you watch as the ropes on one come
free One of them  looks at
their hands and doesnt know exactly what happened
but is apparently now free of the ropes
 Yes Were not in combat yet so what are
you guys doing
 Within range you mean
 All righty anybody else What are you
preparing for
 Youre all staying right there
 Oh this way
 Anybody else preparing
 All right
 Okay Shakste anything
 Whereabout
go Hide in those crags over there by the thats
it Keep a good eye Good girl
  All righty The manticore
begins to clomp up the steps
 No on foot at the moment like impact
sounds
 Well right now as the manticore crests the
top of the stairs the large jokerlike toothy
grin of the female manticore glances up right
towards all of you and goes 
 Its not within range of you yet
 Youre holding it and its not close enough
I need you all to roll initiative now
 We have  to  anybody
 Nice We have Molly
 And Fjord  to 
 Nice Jester and Nott You have Molly

 Ten to five
 All righty We have
 Well simultaneously with the priest
 Five 
 Okay
 Its okay I got you At this point top of
 Its Molly Fjord Jester Nott the
manticore Beau then Caleb and the priest
together then Shakste
 All righty 
 Its eight plus two which is your
proficiency bonus which is ten Plus your wisdom
modifier What is your wisdom modifier
 It would be  so it hits yeah
 All right the female face grins even wider
the eyes narrow 
 It seems like it shakes its head a bit It
seems strangely wounded briefly but then grins at
the prospect of a new meal
 You move back ten feet to there
 That brings us to Fjords turn
 Right there
 Put you right there
 With the blade drawn
 Right Shakste as you watch the halforc
Fjord suddenly emerges from his hand out of
nowhere this flash of greenishblue energy and a
splash of water spatters across the ground as a
slightly curved at the tip falchion appears that
has a cluster of barnacles along the base of it
and slowly curling up the blade and sea water
dripping off of it at all times leaving a trail of liquid
 That hits
 This thing is pretty big its not too hard
to hit comparatively
 All righty that ends your turn Its now
Jesters turn
   Are you getting within melee
of it
 There you go
 Roll for attack
 As you rush around the corner out of the
corner of its eye it sees you As it spins its
giant spined tail which you can see now which
looks like a porcupine filled with javelins
Rushes past and slams into your shoulder As you
do your sickle flies out of your hand and
clatters across the ground and hits the floor at
the bottom of the stairs That is where your
sickle currently is
 End of your turn Jester
 All righty Nott your turn
 All right make another dexterity check
 With that the other persons rope falls free
and theyre both out of their ropes Theyre both
looking at the only exit that is currently blocked
by this giant manticore creature They look
scared and have no idea whats happening They
havent seen you For some reason their ropes have
dropped and theyre scared shitless They arent
guards These two look like civilians and theyre
having a really rough time
 As far as you know
 Theres the priest
 Theyre not guards theyre civilians
 Make a persuasion check
 Okay you deliver the message Thats as far
as you know
 Okay All right that finishes your turn It
is now the manticores go It is going to make
three attacks a bite and two claw attacks Its
going to make two claw attacks Actually its
going to make one sweeping claw attack at Jester
from behind and then a bite and a claw attack at
you since youre right in front of it and already
struck it with your falchion
 First ones at disadvantage which would be
against Jester as you rush past That is a 
and a 
 Yeah it hits you thats without bonuses
unfortunately You take from the first strike nine
points of slashing damage as it  It
rolled high a nine again Then two strikes
against you
 Okay whats the save It was a natural 
on you Fjord unfortunately The other claw attack
 A dex save all right That is a 
 So that hits All right go ahead and
roll damage
 d
 Oh right yeah
  points of damage Of cold damage
 With an awkward flick of her wrist you
watch as this wave of ice spike energy flies
outward and pierces the side of the manticores
body as it rotates and breaks the ice off of its
torso In doing so it spins around with its other
claw and strikes right into Fjord with a natural
 It rolled a one on the fucking damage die so
youre fucking lucky on that thats twice in this
game Its kind of disappointing on my end but
its fine So thats five points of slashing damage
 Thats right
 As it strikes with its second claw attack
against you and the ice cracks and it looks at
you and the mouth opens wide and you can see where
three separate rows of teeth like this horrible
shark maw As it reaches forward to bite towards
you the head itself about maybe this wide the
jaw can almost clamp down onto your waist
Jurassic Park style Thats going to be a  to hit
 Thats ten points of piercing damage from
the bite to you
 She
 Interesting in this quick series of hits
shes doing fine but this is an unexpected burst
of damage and you can see harryings starting to
show A powerful creature can do some powerful
damage but is showing a little bit of wear and
tear With that the manticore is going to take to
the sky
 Its going to fly up
 You both do yes
 You can punch it make an attack
 What did you roll
 You do yes
 Nope you both  The giant gust of
wind from the wings flapping push you away and you
have to block your vision to keep the dust out of
the way Finishing the manticores turn it is now
Beaus go
 How far are you going to move forward 
feet
 Youre seeing faint flashes of light
Actually you dont see any light because no
ones cast any spells its all been combat so
its just darkness and you hear roars and slams
and impacts Youre like 
 Okay that finishes your turn Caleb and the
priest are going simultaneously What are you doing
 Well first off the spell you prepared
never went off so the spell is gone its used
 So the spells gone so you lose one of
those
 You have enough to generally light most of
the chamber
 Perfect Thats your action
 Okay That comes to the priests turn The
priest is going to step forward angrily and is
going to attempt to cast Hold Person on you
 Halforcs are people too Sam Make a wisdom
saving throw
 With that you feel your muscles lock up
your entire body freezes in place as you feel your
entire physical self lock up unable to move
 All right The priest is going to go ahead
and take two steps back after casting that and
hide behind
 Caleb that finishes your turn as well
Shakste youre up
 Yeah its a foot square
 Yeah the manticore is about  feet up in
the air right now so its just out of the range
 I will say Spiritual Weapon as far as I
know let me see here real fast Its pretty
great
 It says a floating spectral creature it
doesnt specify if that it can or cannot move up
and down so I would imagine you could create it
in the air if you want
 Do you move forward to cast it
hallway
 How far there
 Youre creating it at the base of the
manticore or further in the chamber or where
her
 Easily enough to do What kind of weapon do
you create
 What magical mystical weapon would you like
to create that represents your attack on this
creature
 What do you want to do
 Estelle Getty begins to bludgeon itself into
this creature I love it
Mya you should be in bed but this is for you
baby
 Go ahead and roll a melee spell attack Roll
that and add five to it
 That hits Roll the damage on that one It
is d plus three
 Roll that and add three
 Still four points of damage Nothing to
scoff at and its still out there without concentration
 Do you want to move anywhere or you going
to stay put
am
 Good to know Finishing that top of the
round Molly youre up
 All righty
 A two It does not succeed
 All right four points of psychic damage
and first attack has disadvantage
 Cool sounds good Thats the end of your
turn Molly Fjord youre up
 Yep so roll a wisdom saving throw to see if
you can resist it
 Nope youre still locked in place
 Nope Nothing That ends Fjords turn
Jester youre up
 Okay Is it a wisdom saving throw
 Dexterity save That is a ten
  sorry
 Six damage of radiant As its right
behind its trying to block around the pillar
but you still have a clear visual as you
concentrate on the symbol of the Traveler hidden
beneath your outfit You focus and theres a burst
of energy that burns around its body
 Pink energy that sparkles around him as he
looks over towards you and he continues to try and
crouch behind the stalagmite
 It is so he has to make a concentration
check Which he fails Thats an  No its a
ten No it succeeds Just barely succeeds The DC
is ten Sorry He rolled a nine but he has a plus
one constitution Sorry
 Yeah he succeeded He has to meet the DC or
higher But good try
 Yes you can
 No not yet unfortunately
 Well theyre coming around for their turn
 You have your sickle you still have more
movement if you wanted to move You have ten more
feet Or  more feet
 All right Youre right up in his face That
ends your turn Nott youre up
 Gnollish priest Regular gnoll regular
gnoll
 They watch as a tiny goblin with jagged
teeth yells at them as they run by However there
are more scary things in the current vicinity You
rush past and theyre two civilians not guards
but continue
 Im okay with that Theyre guards from your
perspective All right so you run past
 Make an attack roll
 It hits it Its a baby Roll damage
 Its helpless its sneak attack
 It cant do anything It cant defend
itself Its eyes arent open
 As you plunge your short sword down into the
mewling eyecovered cub it goes still as the
mother manticore flying up in the air turns around
to watch this and gives a 
 Nott that ends your turn Its the
manticores turn The manticore which was about
to unleash a triple round of attacks against a
paralyzed Fjord who while paralyzed would have
all been criticals strangely saved him and is
instead going to dart
 It does not no At a foot fly speed
land right next to you Nott and take a full
round of strikes against you Too angry to worry
about tail spines at this point its going all
in physical assault to whatever just murdered its
baby
 Disadvantage on the first strike  and a
natural one
 Which Ill say causes it to strike down
towards you in fury and instead its claw gets
jammed into the ground so it gets disadvantage on
its second attack Im trying to play with natural
ones a little more in this campaign This is the
second claw attack against you A natural  and a
 It hits but it avoids the critical which is
good
 That is nine points of slashing damage with
the claw
 Then the bite attack is going to come
towards you Im going to give this advantage
because you just killed its baby
 Yeah thats going to be a 
 All righty There we go theres the actual
damage die roll Thats  points of piercing damage
 Oh shit

 That ends the manticores turn The
civilians get up
 And begin to run  They get that
far with the movement and dash Theyre 
tripping and falling managing to make their way
there Theyre both frightened covered in all
sorts of dirt and gore and running in your
direction trying to get away from whatevers
happening back there The roar set a further fire
in them All right Beau youre up
 Nott is  feet from you
  You can get right up to the top
of the steps
 Okay You scoop up Nott That means because
youre carrying another creature your movement is
halved when you run Are you using its your
action to grab and pick him up
 Ki point Step of the Wind to run That
moves you and Nott  feet You get Nott to there
The manticore is going to take an attack of
opportunity against Nott
 Of course The creature doesnt give a shit
about anybody but that little goblin that stabbed
its baby
arent you
 That is  to hit
 A bite strike again that is ten points of
piercing damage
 As you pull Nott away theres a sudden tug
and you pull hard and you look back and you watch
as you drag Nott out of the teeth of it grinding
across the body dragging wounds like daggers
across Notts face and chest You see blood pour
out of each of these scars
 All right so you are unconscious and
bleeding out
 Nope thats your whole turn You used
everything for that End of Beaus turn Caleb and
the priest are up
  hits Roll damage
  points of cold damage Nice
 You moved up there It strikes the
manticore a burst of ice that freezes part of the
side of the mane and the fur on its body before
the fur cracks and the flesh that it impacted
cracks Theres a little bit of muscle exposed
beneath the wound left behind from the frost
freeze you left on the side of its torso
 That ends your turn The priest who is
currently working on that going to maintain Hold
Person is going to step up No its going to
yeah because youre right there in front its
going to Inflict Wounds on you
 A melee spell attack Not great Actually
not bad Thats a 
 That is your armor class  hits You take
d points of necrotic damage
 I know
 That is  points of necrotic damage to
you
 Oh no
 You watch as the priest reaches out and
grabs onto the armor of Jester and with a burst
of black energy the veins under Jesters blue
skin begin to pulse with black energy and she
screams out as her eyes loll back and close and
she hits the ground unconscious
 Yeah That ends the priests turn Your
turn Shakste
 You have  feet to move forward
 The Spiritual Weapon can only move  feet
though which will only get it about there unfortunately
 I thought it was  on a bonus action
 Well the range of the spell is  feet but
then the bonus action to move it is  feet and
repeat the attack Sorry guys
 You can move forward if you want to Did you
want to move forward the rest of your
close enough I could do Sacred Flame
 Okay Thats a wisdom save right
 That is going to be an  Which your DC is
 that hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Thats just three points of damage Three
points of radiant damage It bursts and hes still
trying to concentrate on the spell He does make a
constitution saving throw Thats an eight Thats
a failure The DC is ten With that your
paralysis ends
 Yeah its either half the damage or ten
whichever is higher With that you blast it and
he loses the spell and all of a sudden your body
comes back into control of you Fjord You have
the bonus action You can still move the weapon if
you want to
 It was up ten feet technically It can move
down and then move over here and it would be down
on the ground right there
 If you wanted You could move it anywhere
else you want to
 The bust  and rests floating in the
air That brings us to the top Molly youre up
 There you go
 Whats the range on Vicious Mockery
 Yeah you can do that here Wisdom save for
the manticore 
 Sorry
  Fjord youre up
 Its an action
 You reach down pull out the healing potion
Its a regular healing potion right
 Yeah so that would be d plus two you
heal
 So you heal eight
 You may
 From there it was  six thats as
far as you get
 As you move out of range the priest is
going to make a strike at you with his dagger
 Yeah to get to her you would have
 Yeah because you would have moved Oh
god
 Thats okay You stay there That ends
Fjords turn Jester youre up You are on the
ground prone but are now conscious and
breathing as you feel the glass vial pulled away
from your lips and Fjord looks down at you with a
nod like Go
 Go ahead and roll that Thats a d plus
your wisdom modifier
 So you heal eight points
 Movement to run You can move  feet
 You do not have that ability unfortunately
Thats a rogue and monk ability to use a point
Clerics do not get that Sorry Lets put you
there
 Okay The priest does get attack of
opportunity on you as you run past as you were
engaged in melee
 Well he rolled a three The dagger hits
your armor and scrapes off the metal No effect
That ends your turn Jester Nott youre up
 Youre prone technically in Beaus arms
right now
 This is I assume Hideous Laughter
 All right well see if this works Wisdom
saving throw That is a  What is your DC
 Theres been a lot of just under this game
 Weirdly as angry as this manticore is at
you You know what Im going to give it
advantage in the saving throw because you killed
its baby
 You killed its baby
 Im allowing it because Im the fucking DM
It doesnt help I rolled a two Shit I felt it
was fair for the mother of the baby that you just
murdered
 I would have and from a narrative
standpoint it made sense Still takes effect The
manticore turning around eyes filled with fury
and anger goes  She all of a sudden
begins to chuckle As the mouth opens from the
laughter you see the jagged teeth filled with
your own blood and the tongue lashing around from
the laughter as it falls on the ground prone and cackling
 Its dark enough where in this lighting it
looks black
 It is prone which means melee attacks do
get advantage against it
 Its up to you The manticores pretty hurt
The priest has taken a little damage but the
priest also doesnt look very hardy But its up
to you You can flee or you can finish it There
are advantages and disadvantages There are
advantages to both
this priest has on him Are there any ears on him
 No ears There is actually on the head The
gnoll head has ears
drag that fucking carcass back to the surface I
bet thatll
 Youre probably not wrong
fucking thing on my wall
 All righty Well thats up to you guys to
make your choices
 Each time it takes damage
 It gets to make a save again
 Yeah And on the end of its turn it gets to
save
 Well regardless
 Thats up to you
 Yeah thats true Because it is the
manticore you still have movement if you want to
 You have  feet of movement if you want
Beau to put you down
 Ten 
 You do yeah
 Okay Good to know All righty Finishing
Notts turn the manticores turn The manticores
chuckling laughing on the ground howling Its
echoing throughout the chamber in this very
dark
 Ill put you about roughly well say
there The manticores going to attempt to make
its wisdom saving throw
 That is a  again I rolled two elevens in
a row
 The civilians continue to run and they are
just up the tunnel You hear their heavy breathing
fade as they disappear into the darkness Beau
youre up
 Beau its your choice What are you doing
 Okay You move in to the priest Go for it
  hits Hes only wearing leather armor
 Nine points of damage Whack Right across
the face You knock part of the gnoll head off
Its offkilter to the side and he spits blood and
looks back at you Do not worry He will come for
you too
 Go for it
 That hits
  does not hit unfortunately But the next
one does
 Ten points of damage nice With the staff
hit he laughs at you the blood spilling out on
the side of his chin You smack him with the
elbow miss with the upper cut but as the elbow
cracks and hits you feel like the jaw kind of
dislodge a bit As he looks back he reaches up
and hes trying to put it back into place Hes
looking not too great
 You said ten Yeah you shouldnt have
done actually it wouldve been seven
 Its all good No worries so seven damage
on that one That ends your turn
 You can yeah
 Okay It already got an attack of
opportunity against So you move up  
 All right Caleb and the priest Your turn
simultaneously
 He does have threequarters cover behind
that from your current position
 You can move there to get a view without
hitting
 How do you want to do this

 Okay As you release the bolt the anger in
your eyes the fury coursing through the veins in
your hand The Fire Bolt slams into the priests
head and he falls back on the ground screaming
As you watch Ghost Riderstyle his head just
bursts into flame and burn away until he falls
back to his knees You can just see the darkened
expression of a black skull into the fire as he
falls I need you to make a wisdom saving throw
 A wave of memories come flooding to you and
you feel your motions grow slow
 You guys watch as Caleb stares at this and
continues to stare at the guy burning in flames
That ends your turn
 Shakste its your turn

 Shakste your turn
Spiritual Weapon
 You do
 Oh thats particularly awful
what Theres way too much gambling at the track
Everybodys constantly upset about the humidity
This is what your problem is Maybe next time
youll eat something less humanlike baby What
do I need to roll
 Roll a d plus five with advantage because
it is prone So roll a d twice and take the
higher of the two
 Correct
 Nine plus five is  That is just its armor
class That hits It has an armor class of  So
roll damage on that d plus three
four Four plus three is seven
 Seven points of damage As the bust slams
into the manticore after your musings pierced its
soul its going to attempt to make a saving
throw with advantage
 Its a two Because whenever it takes an
impact from an attack it gets an advantage on the
saving throw to break it A two and a five
however

 Its okay it happens Its good its
cinematic Its fun Thats your bonus action You
still have an action
 Yes you do
 Yeah So you still have an action if you
want to cast another spell or do something else as
an action
now
 The priest is already dead The manticores
pretty hurt Some of them are pretty beat up and
low Some of them seem to have avoided the fray
I Im still pretty far from the manticore
arent I
 Youre about  feet from it
at about a foot cube to do my Thunderwave
 Thunderwave yeah
 Sacred Flame All right That will be an
eight plus one for the wisdom modifier That does
not succeed So roll thats d radiant damage
 You did damage yeah
right
 Exactly Thats how spells work a lot of the
time man
 A six As is tradition it seems for our
guests how do you want to do this

 Thats ridiculous by the way Thats fucked
up Im counting and Im like if he gets the kill
this is going to this is ridiculous
 Thats hospitality Jesus Christ
 So how do you want to do this As its on
the ground laughing and cackling and writhing
start to play with the flames that start to light
on the edges of my fingers As I slowly bring them
together theres a musical interlude that starts
to play and shoots towards the manticore Diving
down her throat and bursting through the chest of
her and exploding her heart You know what I did
that out of love For someone who just lost their child
 There you go As Shakste smiles the
merciful grin of a person who knows that the loss
of a child is hard you release this torrent of
sound energy into the cackling mouth of the female
manticore As the writhing stops and she begins
to stand up looking down looks back at the
corpse of the child now laid still Looks back at
you with a look of pity and acceptance before
 There is a burst of gore out of the
chest and the creature just falls to the ground
motionless The wings flopping onto the ground
still And silence takes the chamber

 Okay Caleb comes to
 Make a perception check
 Amongst the chunks of flesh and rather
horrible attire theres a couple of interesting
adornments on the priest The nest looks like its
a mishmash of all kinds of things cobbled
together
 Okay From that there was a set of goggles
that were affixed over the priests eyes of a
dark lens
 There is also that reddish glove that was
affixed to his right hand
 Make an investigation check for me please
 No shit Whats the total there for that
 All right As you tear through the rubble of
skeletal hand that has been mostly chewed through
though a single fleshy finger still holds a ring
of beautiful silver make and a blue gem that
catches your attention What at first looks like
part of the wooden riffraff that makes the nest
you pull out a refined and wellcarved stick that
doesnt match the rest of the rather rough wood
 Also tangled within the mass you find
chains but larger than normal chains These chains
are attached to a set of unlocked manacles much
larger than any human manacles youve seen There
are four identical loops a little over one foot
in diameter all attached via this chain to one
larger one about four feet in diameter
 It looks like it would have been the size
for a manticore Since you rolled so high in
investigation you also notice that these
manacles which are open have a single rune
pressed into where they meet and lock in place as
there is no other visible locking mechanism You
are unable to really at the moment ascertain the
nature of it These manacles are fresh theyre
clean compared to all the other stuff in here
They are there
 Make an arcana are you proficient in
arcana
 Are you proficient in arcana
 Make an arcana check please
 Youre unable to really ascertain the nature
of the runes unfortunately
 Okay
 What would you like to cast
 Okay You watch as the central portion of
the chamber begins to fill with a thick mist
somewhat obscuring your vision more than a few
feet in front of you
 All right What else would you like to do
 Honestly it looks like everything was
clustered in the nest or on the priest
 Easily enough Within but a few moments
between the tripleblades that the two of you
wield you manage to carve a fresh and carryable
by two of you this is now the second beast head
you guys have acquired carrying along with you
a female manticore head
 All the manacles together probably weigh
about  pounds so its carryable
 You couldnt carry it
 All right You guys manage to exit the
mines it seems that the remainder of the gnoll
warband have either scattered or collapsed beneath
the earlier tunnel falling
 You bring yourself back to the surface The
light of the day is growing closer to sunset
another hour hour and a half or so before the sun
sets but you return to the shack which has been
untouched unsullied since your leaving The
remainder of the survivors greet you upon you
letting them know youve returned and you watch
two more reunions occur as the two individuals you
had saved from the belly of the manticore find the
rest of their family within the survivors You
gather the rest of the bodies and whoever needs
the travel and begin to load up the cart you
brought with you as well as the manticore head
unless you want to carry that back to town yourself
 You can rope it onto the cart without much
of an issue though you still have a single horse
pulling a lot of people and a lot of manticore
head That horse is not going to be traveling at
maximum speed its going to be a slow pace on that
thing
 Eventually after night falls you can make
camp or you continue to make your way to Alfield
Its only a few miles off and youll probably get
there maybe an hour or two after sunset
 All right As you guys make your way under
the outskirts of town back through the forest
that cradles the northeast side of the city a
handful of crownsguard that are keeping watch for
any sort of incursion watch you approach and
immediately one of them puts up a hand Halt Who
goes there
 Right the um yes come this way he
seems to not be able to deal with the fact that
youve arrived with all of these survivors and
the head of a manticore being pulled by this poor horse
 Making your way into the town Since youve
seen it last a number of buildings still lay
in cinders ash and burned structures but the
people are in the process of cleaning and
rebuilding their lives from the night before where
this first attack initially happened Within a
short time the crownsguard seemed to have brought
Bryce back for you Bryce which you have not met
yet is currently the Watchmaster of the town You
see a genderfluid halfelf with blonde
shoulderlength hair and armor They seem to be
recovering from the wound they sustained the night
before and as you approach they immediately come
up to you with a bit of a jog and say My gods
youve certainly come through on my what is
that
 Apparently They scratch their head and
shake their head in wonderment Well youve
 Thank you What do we call you
 Very well The woman by the way who you
had helped earlier she comes forward with two of
the members and they come forward to the
Watchmaster and they say Bryce Watchmaster all
of these people came and helped my baby And
and turns and looks at you and is looking about to
introduce you if you have a moment you wish to
halt or intercede
over my lips Shh
 Anyway thank you all Other folks are
starting to come out of their respective homes now
to see this spectacle Children are gawking and
you hear gasps at the sight of the horrible beast
head the tongue lolling out and dragging across
the ground
Other people are gathering and having
reunions other people are beginning to identify
the dead that have been brought in the cart and
while there is sadness and crying there is also
closure There are even some still that are
disappointed to not see those they had hoped to
see amongst those who had been recovered Given
that still a heros night is to be prepared and
people begin to prepare food For a brief moment
past the darkness you can hear music begin to
build as people begin to bring chairs and
tables out to the center of the town square the
intersection of where Alfields simple backwoods
lifestyle seems to still understand what
celebration is in the face of victory As what
better case is there to be but to celebrate those
who stood up to such evils As you all think over
what youve done this ragtag group of wandering
knownothings that have managed to come together
and do a good thing For some coin maybe but a
good thing nonetheless
 On that note were going to end tonights
game

history Thank you guys so much for tuning in
Well be back here next Thursday to continue this
story Until then is it Thursday yet Have a good
night

 Welcome back And welcome back Laura when
she gets done using the restroom Where we left
off you guys have been travelling northward into
the Marrow Valley eventually making your way
towards the city of Zadash Along the way you
were passing by the city of Alfield just past the
sunset as an incursion of a gnoll warband began to
set fire to a number of the buildings You rushed
in to aid some of the denizens there jumped in
under the watch of Bryce the Watchmaster there
and managed to slay a few but they managed to
escape with a number of bodies and living members
of the community You were then given the
opportunity to make some money and to wreak some
proper vengeance for this town by finding out
where these gnolls were and retrieve those who
were still living andor the bodies of those that
needed to at least be given a proper burial Along
that path you discovered this underground network
of what was an abandoned mine where they had been
holing up While you were travelling down there
and battling with these gnolls as you did you
Shakste and his amazing little dark hummingbird
All of you together managed to make your way
through save a number of lives  pardon
me encounter the priest of these gnollish
creatures who had been using these members of the
town to help feed a mother manticore To retrieve
some of the living members you managed to get
into battle with it Nott slew the baby manticore
drawing its ire and you all by the skin of your
teeth took both the priest and her out and in
doing so saved the lives of those that were
within retrieved a small bounty of things that
were caught within the nest and the priests
corpse and made your way back to town Upon
arriving

 Thats Sams gift to you guys Upon
returning the sun had set A number of members of
the city of Alfield began to thank you for what
youve done They began to come out into the
streets and began to make small campfires and play
music and basically take this moment to both
grieve and be thankful that there are individuals
who will stand up and show strength in the face of
darkness even this far out on the edges of the
empire In this time you realize right about now
that your new friend Shakste seems to have
vanished from the vicinity You glance about and
at a quick look hes gone
 You did yes
 The base of them is a soft leather thats
been cured and taken care of once you manage to
wipe off some of the blood and soot from the
remains of the previous owner Its a set of
goggles that can be comfortably placed over your
head and the glass elements or the lenses of them
have a bluishpurple sheen to them
 When you place them over your eyes because
immediately in the vicinity theres the few small
bonfires people have gathered around other than 
that its a dark night sky with stars peeking through the
elements of the clouds that have broken apart It
looks like a cloudfront is still blowing in from
the eastern side of the valley but from what
little bit of the sky you can see the stars are
there Upon placing the lenses over your eyes you
have clear definition of all the nearby buildings
the dark alleyways You have a very clear
perspective on anything that is not directly being
hit by firelight and the firelight is almost a
little too bright
 It tugs all of your horn jewelry and under
it in an uncomfortable way
 No effect actually
 Do you have Identify as a spell
 The ring that would have the pearl on it is
no longer on your hand and the one that you have
does have set into it a fairly nice pearl
 You can certainly try
 As soon as you finish screaming it you turn
around and go face to face with Crute the rather
roughlooking dwarf who runs the Feed and Mead
where you guys have been staying He goes Huh
that would be my place where you are staying
 Everyone around is like Eh But
hes already got your attention He leads you guys
back to the familiar Feed and Mead Where has been
empty previously when you guys were staying there
now there seems to be a little bit of an air of
celebration Since that is where you guys are
going other people are following and it seems the
party is going where youre going As you enter
the place Crute seems excited because now all of
a sudden theres a burst in clientele
 As you begin to order your drinks many of
the various villagers prevent you from paying For
the remainder of the evening your drinks are on
the town of Alfield
 Okay Theyre common folk for the most part
Nobody seems to notice Those that even do watch
you arent going to argue Now is that just
drinks on you
 Okay depending on how many rounds you guys
want thatll put you down about two gold
probably by the time the night is done
 Fair enough Make it three gold 
Caleb youre spending time
 It is riveting
 Make a sleight of hand check
 Yes the pearl is enough for you to focus on
the spell
 The ring
 And you know what this is
 Yep Look at the majesty of this
 Make an insight check
 She seems to be on the level
 You technically have two more
 Okay make a is it a wisdom or charisma
 Charisma saving throw please
 Yeah
  Onto the table
 You finish the spell They are not magical
They once were and you can tell by the runes at
the base of where the manacles clink together that
they were at some point sealed Whatever
enchantment was on them has been released
 Theres also the glaive
 No there was a glove
  Everyone whos near in the vicinity
all of a sudden turns as this loud heavy clatter
of metal chains
 A glaive is a polearm with a giant axe blade
at the top of it
 Its not a monk weapon
 Its a twohanded weapon yeah
 You have a shield youd have to get rid of
your shield and I have go to see if you have the
capability to even use it Because I dont think
you know do you know simple weapons
 Let me double check real fast As far as I
know
 Yeah you arent proficient with glaives
unfortunately
 It was on the priest
 Yeah your left arm goes numb for a while
 You guys have all grown steadily more
intoxicated
 Thats right
 You watch from beneath the mask
 The edges of the toothy goblin grin curl
into this uncontrollable smile that threatens to
crack the sides of her face
 At this point these two young farm boys
that were in there drinking in the back and watching
listening in are just staring at Nott and backing away
slowly to the back of the room We got to go
 We got to go They leave the room and
everyone else just looking over Yeah its caused
a bit of a scene
 Does it require attunement
 After putting it on you would actually know
the properties of it
 No Its faded by now
 Make a charisma saving throw
 She did charisma
 As you guys finish your cheer everyone else
in the room also lifts their drinks Hurrah They all
give a cheer as well
 As the evening continues some folks come up
and tell their stories to you give you thanks
Share a drink if someone was lost Some recovered
some not Overall everyone seems to be very appreciative
Eventually whether through just general
exhaustion or imbibement you bring yourself to
rest finding yourselves back to the singular room
youve all been sharing here at the Feed and Mead
 Three
 Its not a big place
 At the moment Yes
 Crute while he has been happy to provide
you the evenings free for two rooms even for all
youve done I am a businessman through and
through so Ill give you a discount Three silver
 
 Of course Then that will be also three
silver
 Thank you  You have your own room
now
 Do you actually partake in pickled ears
 You all find yourselves going about what
final business you have for the evening before
rest takes you You are doing your
 You watch as you finish the incantation and
the ritual comes to a complete cycle in the
center of where you made these markers across the
table you hear this slight tearing sound and there
is this slight ripple in the air right in front of
you in the center of this and its almost like a
slight little tear in reality almost From that
Frumpkin steps out and lands looks up at you

 Immediately leaps up into your hands
 He purrs against you
 Easy enough to do
 Oh Right
 Well finishing up with you As you finish
that and lay down you lay on one side staring
towards the wall in this moment of quiet You feel
this strange warmth and you look down underneath
your robes and there you have the symbol of the
Traveler that you keep on yourself the door arch
and path and its warm to the touch warmer than
your skin is The subtle sensation of familiar
closeness comes over you and wordless but an
emotion washes through your brain thats alien
from the outside of your own thoughts that just
says Im with you
 Okay You start going through There were four
letters clustered in here You tear through the
first one and look at it and it looks like its a
shipment ledger up by Nogvurot Nogvurot its a
city on the northern end of the empire Its just
an information ledger about shipments received
confirming payment and distribution to which
taverns are receiving it and then asking for the
next shipment The second one that you open is
another ledger this one comes from Deastok to the
west This ones cheaper its a smaller ledger
The third one you open up and its a complaint
 From Rexxentrum Its titled by it
doesnt have the name but it says The purveyor of
the Rotted Stump which is apparently some sort of
would happily request that if you are to send the
aforementioned and already paid shipments to our
establishment that they would not be containing
any sort of animals of which could chew through
and ruin and spoil the shipments youve been
given We request an immediate refund It shows a
copy of a deal that was made Its just an open
complaint
 The fourth ones a little interesting Its
 Make an intelligence check
 No because this would be an investigation
check specifically not an intelligence it would
be an investigation
 Eight Well Youre just going to have to
figure it out on your own
 You dont actually
 Okay
 Which pouch is this
 Oh Shakstes pouch You find what is
roughly a handful of bird seed
 Well its a heavy pouch and contains about
 gold pieces
 Theres some dried jerky and hide in there
just for trail snacks It seemed like a half road
travel pack that Shakste was keeping with him and
whatever coin he had brought with him on the journey
 
 It does help a little
 Go ahead and make an alchemy supplies check
Roll that plus your proficiency bonus and your
intelligence
 It will take you through the night and part
of the morning to do it With a full nights
sleep a full rest if you start early enough in
the night by about noon tomorrow youd be done
 Throughout that you manage to create a vial
of acid
 Looking at it it looks like the base
material for the pearl set in its a polished brass
that has been treated to look like gold but some
of that treatment is rubbing off and you can see
the duller brass color beneath
 I will look As far as your school of
transmutation
 Wood stone iron copper or silver
 Okay make a general strength check
  It doesnt take you too long Working on
it back and forth you eventually have enough give
where the four claws that hold the pearl into the
ring set eventually give way and it pops out It
does hit the ground and roll and you quickly catch
up to it and grab it
 Frumpkin just watches it land thunk
thunk
 
 Okay yeah Looking about at this point in
the evening most of it is filtering out The few
stragglers there are the older folks grizzled
farmhands with sunburned skin thick fingers that
have seen a lot of field work a lot of them
reminiscing about days of old some of them
talking about some folks they know that were lost
over the previous events but they seem drunk
enough to at least be smiling and laughing about
these old stories they bring up You continue to
study these personalities I imagine youre
probably taking in quirks taking in elements of
their body language their vocal intonations for
your own purposes
 Okay As you all eventually close the
evening the morning sun comes to with Nott
sleeping in a little further after staying up late
creating a vial of acid
 What do you guys want to do
 Make a nature check
 Make a nature check You both may make a
nature check in this moment in a strike of inspiration
 Okay youve heard it somewhere Nothing
big but like bloodroot Ive heard of it You
know it Its a unique flower that is pretty in
its own right but you know it because the places
where its used are usually fenced off in a way
that children cant get to them because they are
known to be poisonous Not to the point of death
but to the point of severe nausea and vomiting
upon ingestion
 Its been probably at this point four
days would be my guess
 You guys all wake up and get your breakfast
situated and sorted Nott joining you a little
later on but you are fed the morning is fresh
what would you like to do
 Asking around youre eventually led to
where Bryces location is Apparently they are in
the process of going through paperwork in the Salt
Trench Jail Thats where the prisoners of
Alfield this podunk town keep there imprisoned
Being led to this small but functional shack of
stone and dried wood eventually Bryce emerges
not fully armored but theyre wearing comfortable
robes with a bit of the ceremonial maroon and gold
that a lot of the Crownsguard and members of that
political faction seem to wear As they emerge
you see Bryces face brighten up as they say
Youre awake Come Ive been able to gather
enough pay for your deeds the other day Please
do step inside They lead you over to their desk
How many set of ears have been procured
  sets
 Bryce has a hard time telling the difference
at the moment having been overworked and stressed
with the recent goingson
 Counting through they finish each bit
counted That comes to They pull up a small
chest and begin to count out change into a large
sack Then that fills up into a secondary sack
into a third one finishing with A total of 
gold pieces
 Seven dead bodies at five gold per seven
that will come to  gold pieces as well Which
they fill out for you Then the live ones were
how many
 There were five specifically that you
managed to save actively from the tunnel Shakste
had already saved an additional seven

 And a fourth sack is presented as they
count out ish more gold pieces
 Thats a little over a hundred gold
each
 Not bad almost can afford a suit of armor
 Dont instigate it Youll regret it
 After all the counting is done Bryce is
writing down feverishly For my own ledgers
because I do have to present this paperwork to
the crown for the approval of these rewards what
do we call you
 The Mighty Nein
 Please do spell it for me
 Yes
 I feel like I was part of something crowd
sourced similar to this I feel like Ive been
part of a game call Mighty Number Nine
 Yeah Its a game that I Its a Mega
Man
 Yes I know Oh that game Anyway
 All right The Mighty Nein that is on
the paperwork Are you staying a while in Alfield then
 I dont have much in the way of work here
for your type at the moment
 Whereabouts are you going
 Interesting well thats much larger for
the tastes of most field folk out here I lived
there for about three years when I was younger in
the West Outersteads before joining the
Crownsguard and shipping off to Bladegarden If
you are indeed off to Zadash and are in need of a
friend if shes still there Ask for Claudia
Sheed at the Leaky Tap
 Claudia Sheed
 At the Leaky Tap at the East Outersteads
 It is of moderate size
 That would be the The Pillow Trove Thats
in TriSpires I dont know if you can afford
that I dont know maybe you can I dont know
 Good luck
 The Pillow Trove But The Leaky Tap I
recommend Claudias great she owns the place if
shes still there
 Leaky Tap
 Certain fine Shes got a good head on her
shoulders and at the very least she may be able to
guide you to anything youre looking for
Hopefully Oh I almost forgot follow me please
They stand up and close the ledger and lead you
outside About two blocks down by the outside of
the stables titled the On The Wind Stables There
you see outside a hardy looking female dragonborn
Rotund and strong no tail who is black scaled
turns around as you approach and gives a quick
hand up to Bryce and Bryce approaches Ah thank
you Durmas Everyone this is Durmas She is the
main stable hand here at the On The Wind Weve
taken as a bit of appreciation here weve
outfitted you with a new cart as the previous one
was a bit It had carried many of our dead so
Durmas And Durmas steps forth and says Great
I have presented for you this cart that we had
made It belonged to somebody here but it is now
yours It is well made it is larger than what you
had previously and does not smell of blood and
feces

 Very well She steps back and starts
getting the two horses one that you had brought
along and the other that you had discovered out
there Theyve already been hitched to the cart
 Fed and watered cleaned brushed
 Im sure that can be done Yes I can lend
you some I wish youd told me back in the office
 I think I do and I dont know if this is
the city to find that unfortunately You have
much better luck in Zadash
 Of course
 You watch as they smile a bit based on your
sudden interest and they say Why do you ask
 Best that I summon him But I can retrieve
him
 Ill be right back Weve taken And at
that point you hear a slapping sound you watch as
Shumas the dragonborn shes taken the large
manticore head And is chained into the side and
slammed it on to the side of the cart You still
have that
 Shumas oh no Durmas Sorry
 No Shumas is a region in Marquet sorry I
have too much in my brain
 We can slowly crash every songs YouTubes
comments now
 As you guys are getting your stuff situated
onto the cart eventually you watch as four
crownsguard approach along with Bryce and the
small robed gnomish figure of Starosta Kosh
Right Ive been summoned What is your
business
 Ive been told that you did a great service
for Alfield and for that I am very thankful
 What
 And you have been paid handsomely for it
As the Watchmaster has notified me
 Im confused This is strange but no I
believe that our business is complete
 You watch as his face loses color His hand
drops to his side Um I will be happy to write
you a letter of recommendation but I cannot
assure you that it will be accepted as there are
many points of acceptance within the Academy And
is quite a bit of travel to Rexxentrum anyway Is
this to the actual Soltryce
 Very well it will be done in just a
moment What is your name
 Have you a surname
 Fuck you

 Oh I was keeping it together so well Here
buddy
 Ill return in the next  minutes
Starosta turns and gives a long look of simmering
fury behind a forced smile to Jester Spins around
then walks off in a haughty march to wherever he
came from
 Make a history check
 You may
 You actually wouldnt have
 No Its outside of the Empire
 Its history
 Okay This makes sense for you since you
grew up in the Menagerie Coast though in Port
Damali The Ruby of the Sea is well known in some
circles Youve only heard rumors Belongs to an
establishment that specializes in all forms of
socializing entertainment and is one of the most
prominent brothels in the Menagerie Coast in
which the Ruby of the Sea is known to be the star
courtesan Many travel all across the Menagerie
Coast and beyond supposedly to be within her
company Many have fallen in love with her and had
their hearts broken There are poems and songs
that have wandered through bars and taverns that
spoke of her that first caught your interest It
seems like a faint distant tale that was just a
myth that people made up or someone spoke of Ruby
of the Sea it sounds amorphous
 A wellknown bar jingle all across
Wildemount
 Its more of a jingle than a song really
  Ruby of the Sea now
Today Anyway
 Ahem You look and see that the
Crownsguard are approaching And theres the
Starosta Kosh there with a rolled up piece of
parchment which he presents with a broad smile
As you requested
 Of course its everything I can do Now
be on your way
 Go Please
 He huffs off they all begin to leave as you
guys go to your cart The Watchmaster comes up one
last time and they say Sincerely youve saved
many lives and A paltry sum I could get
approved but know that you have my gratitude
 Of course Good luck to you I hope our
paths cross again
 Yasha
 Ill try my best
 All right
 All right
  Seems straight and narrow
 Hard to read but it seems to be fairly
forthright
 As far as the date
 I have to go and look that up
 It is the th of Fessuran
 Its getting towards the start of fall
 
 On the other side there is Durmas leaning on
one of the horses All right so your horses are
ready your cart is ready
 You should probably go
 All right Durmas gets behind and pushes the
cart out as the horses clomp out My business is
paid good luck She goes back into the stable
and goes about her work
 Animal handling check
 Yeah
 A slight flick of the reins watching your
various allies previously travel with a
controlled snap the horses lurch and 
 With that you guys make yourselves westward
through the central streets of Alfield A few folks
come out and watch you leave those who were
present for the evening and with a final silent
nod and smile you make your way back onto the
Amber Road heading northward deep into the Marrow
Valley on your way to Zadash And were going to
take a break there

 Yay
 Yeah she did She was coughing too hard the
week before last
 How are you doing
 Yeah you go do that Im going to take care
of my wife here in a minute All right guys well

 Hello everyone and welcome back Before we
hop back in the two winners of the Wyrmwood
giveaway are Jevons and Nicholas Fernandez Jevons
and Nicholas Fernandez congratulations you guys
won Danoba will contact you and get your
information so we can get that sent out to you so
congrats All right everyone seems ready and
iced
 Yeah Dont turn and sneeze
 Exactly Speaking of which guys Youve
begun your trek northward back on the Amber Road
passing through the high grass fields the rolling
hills The sky grows more cloudy and as the day
progresses uneventful three horses carrying
crownsguard are patrolling down the Amber Road and
pass by and watch them nod as they continue on
As you continue down for the remainder of the
day you guys probably left around noon Eight
hours of travel would say is a standard travel
day for a horse so thatll be just past sunset
 Thats true So you get back a little bit on
the travel Not too bad Continuing on you hit
sunset and your horse could go for a few more
hours Do you wish to continue to travel in the
night Follow the road
 Right as the sky begins to grow dark enough
to threaten vision for distant vision at least
You use darkvision you have a closer proximity
 The sky is as dark and the distance is as
hard to see But nearby theres some decent
shapes and outlines
 Yep
 Are you in here for drugs No What are
you in for Drugs You dont see any landmarks
that would gather your attention to be a place to
stay or stop at or rest for the evening Your best
plans would be to look for something not far off
the road in the natural environment to make camp
Who is helming that expedition
 Both you guys roll perception
 Okay You find a small clearing that looks
to be a handful of rocks that were partially
lodged into the ground long ago that have since
been overgrown with moss and grass But there is a
bit a small opening where it looks to be the
remains of charcoal A fire has once or many
times been built and then put out there So it
looks like a standard place where people have set
up camp while making their trips up and down the
Amber Road Easy enough to do So you guys set up
for the evening You gather yourselves around
build a small fire
 It doesnt make much of a  much to
your disappointment But a fire is built You all
begin to bed down for the evening and whos
taking first watch
 Okay You can break it up between probably
lets say three watches over a casual evening
 Perception check from you please
 Okay An uneventful evening continues for
you You trade off to Fjord Fjord make a
perception check
 Your mighty nine allows you to keep an eye
out as the dark perimeter seems to bring no shapes
or movements of interest other than the occasional
sound of the wind blowing through the fields and
the distant dark Then your watch is up
Beauregard perception check please
 Keeping an eye out best you can the sleep
takes you eventually and you end up cheating on
the last few hours of your watch Nevertheless
you all come to consciousness in the morning
intact and fine You begin your way further on the
road for a second day Now whos guiding the I
would say more of whos keeping a perimeter watch
during the next days journey
 All right So one of you two well say
thats the case make a perception check with
advantage because of Jesters aiding
 Keeping with the theme of the name I
guess
 Yeah those are still with you
 Continuing on for the rest of the day
eventually you pass by a small travel wagon Its
similar to the size of the cart that you have but
it has some cushioned seats set up in the back
You look towards three well dressed individuals
that are looking miserable Theyre sitting in the
back of the cart as it rides by with a single
coachman whose single horse is pulling it along
with a rather rapid pace You watch as they begin
to approach the few bumps that hit the road are
hitting them relatively hard because of the pace
of which theyre keeping Some of them kind of get
flung up and you watch their hair get mussed and
they quickly put it back into place
 Make a perception check
 Okay
 The best you can tell the cargo within are
personal bags Theres nothing of what looks to be
cargo cargo at least what you have seen in
previous bits of people that have traveled down
here Especially the trade caravan you passed on
your way up to Alfield This looks to be more of a
personnelbased journey They pass glaring as they
look at your colorful variety of individuals
 Yeah heading south
 I mean theyre welldressed They look to
be of bourgeois class Not upper crust but better
than most youve encountered on this side of the
Empire at least And they seem to almost aside
from glaring as you pass pay no mind to any of
your verbiage beyond you motherfuckers
 All right Continuing on for the remainder
of the day seeing nothing else that catches your
eye along the journey eventually the night comes
to a close once more You guys have pretty much
hit the extent of your horses energy for the days
travel right as the sun begins to set So you can
pull off and make another camp for this evening
 Whos helming that one
 Go for it
 Yes
 Not too ooh not good for you Thats
fine Easy enough you find
 You find maybe a few hundred feet off of
the eastern side of the Amber Road a small dip in
the ground It looks like an area where the earth
seems to sink almost a bit This crucibletype
look for maybe  or so feet There in the center
you see another wellused stop along the way
Theres some discarded empty scraps of sack You
can see a couple of small stone rings where fires
were previously set Theres a lot of travel on
this road and so its not too difficult if
youre keeping an eye out for a while to find
some place thats been used over time as a place
to rest for the evening So you set up camp there
without an issue
 Right For a foot cube
 All right So after setting up your alarm
 As you complete your set up for the evening
make a perception check
 Okay You are sitting back for a minute 
the fire crackling to a very diminutive ember
Theres just a bit of light slowly flickering off
framing the outer shapes of your various sleeping
friends and companions You dont hear the
snapping of twigs because its subtle enough A
brief tickle hits the back of your head Caleb as
the thread perimeter is broken
 As that happens a voice goes I wouldnt
do that if I were you At which point you
immediately whip around and you guys see in the
vicinity standing directly around where youre
sleeping you see nine figures
 This number coming up is so creepy you
guys They all look humanoid some variation to
height but most of them seem to be standard human
some leathers a lot of what seems to be cobbled
together and scrapped to build some sort of
defense You see a uniform mismatch of green
blues and black cloths that are covering most of
the faces And hoods
 Ones green Ones blue Couple of black
 Yeah completely different thing As you all
begin to come to conscious and look around you
can see some of them have hand crossbows that
theyre holding out in front Two of them have
heavy crossbows that are currently being held with
two hands that are all locked in There are a few
of them that have shortswords drawn one in each
hand Theyre all threatening but not raring to
leap The one that had spoken out against that
whos right behind you Molly With his boot
presses it against the blade of one of your
scimitars and says I would recommend you just
take a step away from that You feel this very
sharp point of a nocked crossbow bolt that taps
the back of your skull
 Theyre both set in your usual placed
wrapping Your ceremonial set before you go to bed
at night
 Okay
 Hes stepping on them right now
 Okay As you begin to walk towards the cart
which is breaking the perimeter of their holding
the ones on that side go 
The one who spoke up before just goes All right
No big moves No trouble wanted Get your friends
up Place your valuables onto that cart for us
you have hitched over there And well leave you
with your life No worries 
 Okay Make a sleight of hand check
 As soon as you begin to and correct me if
Im wrong Friends actually let me see here
Friends is no Its
 Okay Yeah so your charisma checks The
spell seems to take an effect
 Make a deception check
 Yeah it gives you advantage Yeah
 You watch as one of the eyes over the face
scarf closes and twitches He goes Right good
to know Then

 I suppose were going to be leaving you
unspoiled
 Then I suggest you all just get down on
your knees and stay where you are Were just
going to take your cart and whats inside of it
 Take the cart and whats inside of it They
all begin to shift slowly all keeping their
weapons drawn begin to move over towards the
cart One of them hops up into the back and begins
rummaging through the stuff
 At which point one of them pull over a
cloth He goes Jesus Chri They all turn
around weapons drawn again like What the fuck
are these people doing
 Looks over to Fjord
 You also infected

 Make an intimidation check
 This would be the very tail end of your
Friends spell
 Yeah
 He looks to the rest of the guys I dont
know Theres a moment where the spell comes to
an end and he goes Clever motherfucker
 Okay Okay Well they had weapons drawn and
were prepared for something
 This is all going to happen simultaneously
 Youre attacking What are you doing
 Okay Scorching Ray to the guy whos been
talking as well
 Scorching Ray to the guy whos been talking
as well
 Okay
 Okay
 Who are you going to get in front of
 Youre all in a clustered circle youre in
your camp Except for Molly whos
 Okay
 Fjord
 Okay Towards the main guy
 Okay Go ahead and make your attack rolls
please
 Oh youre doing Spiritual Weapon
 Yes
  That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Caleb make your attacks for the Scorching
Ray
 Yes The first one
 Multiple rays
 Hits
 All three hit
  points of damage
 Yeah
 Immediately as that ray is released Thats
a  to hit
  to hit
 Yeah
 Thats a  to hit
 And a  to hit
 Okay
 As the flames escape four crossbow bolts

two of them are heavy and two of them are light crossbow
 Correct You went to intercede Ill allow
you to take the hit on that one then The damage
goes through to you automatically
 Ill allow you to do one of them
 Well technically I already made the attack
rolls and you didnt say that
 Thats okay That would have been seven
points of piercing damage
 You catch one right before it hits Caleb
 You can
 That is a d plus your dexterity
modifier
 Yeah Its a heavy crossbow
 Yes
 Well you still have to roll to hit right
You have to roll to hit back yeah
 Yeah Youre considered proficient though
 Yeah that hits
 Okay Caleb you do suffer from the bolts
that do make it through to you  points of
piercing damage
 
 The last thing you watch is the leader
whod been talking with you gets slammed up in
the air about two feet with an uppercut from a
mystical lollipop and then all the rays
incinerate him into ash in midair He is scattered
to ash One of the other guys gets hit with his
own bolt Another guy goes blind What are you
doing
 Against which guy
 All right
  to hit works Go ahead and roll damage
 He gets a blast to the side of the face and
goes down unconscious onto the ground His
crossbow fires wide into the air and disappears
into the night sky As soon as this happens as
you fall unconscious all these hits happen like
this Mexican standoff that just suddenly All
this action happens at once Caleb goes down Two
other guys double over Two of them go Wait
wait Hold on Hold on
 Okay

 All of a sudden as the suckers spinning
and you watch as this bright burst of radiant
energys crackling on the edge of this
nastylooking gnollish blade Theyre all just
standing there What happened to Trevor
 Okay
 All right go for it
 One of them nearby walks over to where
Trevor was where his boots on the ground now are
smoking and picks up a handful of ash and goes
 Were going to go ahead and wish you a good
night 
 We dont have a cart
 No we were taking your cart
 Well we steal your cart and then we get
your stuff and Shut up Hes like Im sorry
 Make an intimidation check
 He goes No
 Is this the Vicious Mockery
 Right Thats a four
 He goes The man makes a valid point and
starts taking his trousers off immediately in the
place All the other guys go questioning
stutters
 They all start pulling and stripping their
armor off As they take their masks off you can
see a lot of them just look like dirty poor
wandering brigands A lot of them are missing
varying teeth A lot of them look like they
havent had a bath in days They look kind of like Caleb
 They look genuinely perturbed by the fact
that you incinerated their de facto leader
Trevor Theres a moment where they go from these
really frightening nameless thieves to a bunch of
people that you feel sorry for as they strip down
and throw their armor on the ground A lot of them
are left with either just some semblance of slacks
or some sort of tattered long johns that are just
stained and awful They throw their crossbows onto
the ground They throw their shortswords and
daggers onto the ground
 Well there are two shortswords that are
currently covered in soot that was once their
previous owner All the rest of the armor has been
burnt and charred And there is ashes
 Make a perception check
 You do see there are a ways over the
previous hill nine horses that are all briefly
hitched to a few stakes that are pounded into the
ground
 Make an animal handling check
 You have been learning as youve made your
way past these barriers with natures beautiful
natural creatures Manage to get four sets of
these reins and these horses look pretty
malnourished and they were probably stolen too
Some of them have brands but different types of
brands You get the sense that they were probably
pulled from different homesteads As you pull them
together theres a moment of you waiting for them
to draw and quarter you Just based on what youre
holding Just like  But they follow You
carefully begin to walk a perimeter around While
thats happening
 Two of the ones go Me They both look at
each other and shoot each other down with these
horrible glares and go No its me again at
the same time Both say Fuck you at the same
time  And theyre just frustrated
 Yeah
 They both come together and 
 All right the one on the left who looks to
be a scraggly redhead probably close to  or
 years old wins the bout of
boulderparchmentshears
 You know I wouldnt say so Yeah no I
mean Trevor he
 I know Trevors turned to ashes
 It was very bad He was a very bad man
 Yeah Yeah youre right You are right
Right And all the boys go Right
 Are you going to bathe me
 
 They start taking their clothes and the one
who this one kid beat at boulderparchmentshears
is like You fucked up Zenny
 Right
 They all start putting on bits of their
clothing most of them are just holding it under
their arms
 Theres eight now and three of them look
like theyre hurting pretty bad One of them has
their own crossbow bolt in their chest that Beau
threw and its still there and hes 
holding it
 They all look very confused
 They all lower their heads and one of them
goes Yeah Zenny Hes like Shut up
 Right Right Right Right

 Two of them drop the coins on the ground and
then pick them up again but with bits of their cloth
 You see as three of them are quietly under
their breath Mighty Nein Mighty Nein okay
 Its at that moment you think youve lost
most of them
 Use Thaumaturgy to make that 
And ever You Gandalfvoice it for a moment and
they all take a step back So leader Zenny
where are we off to Hes like Um I think
lets just head to Felderwin
 Okay Thank you
 Okay They all quickly dart off theyre
pulling their pants up the rest of the way and
theyre making their way back into the field
Theyre avoiding yeah youve certainly made
their evening
 You guys eventually settle yourselves down
to continue your evening of rest
 All right Keep in mind now that youre
having to feed and take of six horses
 Youre running pretty low on doughnuts by
the way
 Yeah They didnt start as lemon tarts
 Basically yeah
 Make an insight check
 Hard to read
 Two heavy crossbows
 Three light crossbows
 Two hand crossbows
 What would amount to  bolts
 Yeah those will be helpful to you
 And six shortswords and two daggers
 You can load up in that cart Carrying them
on your person would be a problem that carts
getting pretty full Thankfully you have more
horses
 Mind you all the equipment you found from
them not in the best condition The swords are
dinged to shit Theyre chipped in places like
theyve been banged against hard pieces
 Hes breathing hes good
 You guys eventually find yourselves back to
rest for the evening Youre keeping second watch now
 Nott go ahead and roll a perception check
for me please
 Okay
 All right Third and final watch
 Go for it
 Yeah During your final watch as people are
finishing up their rest the sun just barely
begins to or would be cresting over the hills
The slight change in light is the precursor that
notifies you of dawn however the heavy dark
clouds in the sky and the sudden sound of thunder
immediately followed the freezing cold rainfall
that begins to spill across the entirety of your
campsite All of you begin to come to
consciousness finishing your long rest by
immediately being drenched in freezing water of a
recent storm here on the Marrow Valley fields
 Okay you guys all bundle up what you can
The horses are trying to stay warm and cuddle up
next to each other
 Im not going to talk about the state of the
manticore head at the moment which is now
drenched in rain
 You guys you have rested for the evening
you continue back onto the path and continue
forward Whos keeping watch on this next journey
Perception check for me please
 You glance off the side of the western edge
of the Amber Road and see a neglected gravesite
maybe  feet off the roads path Its overgrown
in the fields At a quick glance you can gather
maybe close to  various stones that are grave
markers in various states of disrepair and erosion
over time As you ride past and see in the
distance it looks to be an older landmark thats
been left to be reclaimed by nature
 Youd probably get about  or  feet from
it
 No everyones up in the cart or riding
 You guys continue on past up the road Are
you still keeping watch on this
 You glance over to where hes going to pee
and you can see a long in disuse cemetery
 Okay
 Okay As youre finishing your business you
can get within  feet or so and you see that a
lot of the stones are intact some of them have
been cracked and broken a lot of them what once
may have been a wellkept perimeter of earth
dirt and dust has since been completely retaken
by the grasses of the field While the grasses
arent as tall as the surrounding field may be
the greenery and the moss has taken a lot of the
stone and to read a lot of them you would probably
have to clear off whatever bit of growth has
reached up and claimed them
 Okay As you begin to do a conscious pass
across the grave nothing magical catches your
attention within the radius youre observing
 Make an investigation check
 As youre seeking anything thats related to
the undead yeah go for it
 Okay
 As you pick one and look for any signs of
grave emerging or grave robbery or different
things that may be attributed to the necromantic
studies that involve the creation andor
maintenance of undead the site seems to be
largely undisturbed You go through one name and
it says Bagent and the next once you go by says
Avryn and the next stone says Emor The
markings are simple Theyre very simple stones
It looks like whoever was buried here was done so
at the very basic level of marking a grave site
Your foot hits something hard on the ground and
your toe and you look down at a rusted helmet of
iron make You pick it up Make a history check
 Youre unable to make out any details of the
construction of it or any significance of it but
its an old helmet And it looks like a lot of the
edges of it appear to have just slowly been taken
by the oxidization
 As you guys are waiting Calebs returned
and a few minutes later maybe about ten minutes
after you watch as Molly approaches tossing this
deeply rusted iron helmet in his hand
 Make a history check
 Okay You have a little more grasp and
understanding of the history of the valley The
markings on this indicate that this helmet
belonged to a regiment of the Julous Dominion The
Julous Dominion which you recall is the last
remaining empire to be conquered by the Dwendalian
Empire nearly two centuries before
 Zadash was the capital of that empire before
the Dwendalian rule conquered them and took over
As opposed to erasing their society they just
allowed it to be integrated into their own
beliefs and then just imposed their life upon
those people their laws their rules and
adjusted as they saw fit That marked the end of
it This gravesite seems to have been a reminder
of soldiers that fought probably in those
conflicts or something around that time period
and has just been left to the annals of memory as
the Dwendalian influence left no real particular
interest in those to keep tabs of the history
behind them
 You guys continue moving northward again
the rain still pouring as you all maintain warmth
best you can bundling up with the various travel
supplies blankets and insulation you can muster
off the cart and your own
 Yep  As you push into the latter
half of the afternoon a few hours before the sun
begins to set you begin cresting a large hill
along the road before you notice a trio of spiky
peaks catching your eye breaking the skyline
ahead of you As you begin to come higher up to
the top of that hillside you can watch these
peaks slowly unveil into the rest of the massive
skyline of the city of Zadash breaking the
horizon
 Its an incredible sight compared to the
rural townships youve encountered here in the
empire thus far and comparable in mass to the
coastal metropolis of Port Damali where you grew
up The foot perimeter walls outline the
somewhat triangular shape of the city from your
current perspective The communities spilling
beyond the protective bulwarks cascade beyond the
walls into ramshackle tent cities and hovel towns
As you ride down the road towards the stretch that
leads to the southern gates you pass through
fields of crop workers that are currently out
there with heavy shawls and head coverings in the
process of harvesting various vegetables and crops
from the field Some take note of your presence
and watch as you pass and then go amongst their
work others are too involved could care less
about the constant passing of travelers northward
and southward As you approach closer to the city
still the external neighborhoods begin to envelop
your vision as small farmsteads homes begin to
mingle with these tents and shacks you had seen at
a distance A mother in ragged clothes plucks a
chicken before noticing your band and sending her
sixyearold boy over dirt smeared on his face
and no shoes running up to the mud outside the
cart and puts his hands out towards you as you
walk past
 He takes it and runs back to his mom and she
just nods Doesnt make eye contact with you but
as soon as the child approaches gives a nod
Continues pulling feathers out Pushing on the
foot traffic
 Okay Easily enough Pushing on the foot
traffic grows heavier near the gate A huge
foot wide currently open portcullis is being
held aloft by chains beyond your visual range As
two pairs of crownsguards flank each side of this
opening with semiwatchful eyes Theyre not
interrogating passersby theyre keeping a close
watch as folks enter in and out You can see
another caravan is currently in the process of
loading up and getting ready to leave southward
You can see people are walking in and out from the
external shantytown and other individuals are
some are paying attention to the rather once
again your colorful band by comparison most of the
folks you see here range between your typical
human populace to the occasional halfling and
dwarf The fairer races beyond that havent caught
your eye yet on this exterior perimeter Stepping
beyond the crownsguard keeping a watch as you
pass you emerge beyond the threshold of the entry
gate on the southern wall here into Zadash The
smell of wet earth manure immediately hits your
nose accompanied by the sound of hooves mingling
conversations distant shouts and the barking of
dogs as they welcome you into this new and
interesting city Glancing up you can see the
buildings around you that flank the street
continue to be rather destitute in the atmosphere
but then eventually begin to graduate into a
standard village feel Youve arrived
 It is still raining
 Bryce when you were talking about this
Bryce grew up in the West Outersteads but Leaky
Tap is in the east
 Still take your notes
 As the horses are clopping through the mud
and you guys are having this conversation slowly
making your way through town everyone else is
rushing about their business but youre just
leisurely just taking in the vicinity You hear
this coughing off to the side and you watch as a
bundled up hunchedlooking human approaches and
goes Well hello You look a bit lost and
obviously not from around here As the face looks
up you can see within the hood a somewhat
pudgylooking older man in his mids or so it
looks to be He has a thick bushy gray mustache
that turns into a full Stonewall beard on the
side He has a monocle up in one eye but it looks
a bit scratched The cloak hes wearing is just
covering the rest of his form but as he looks and
goes Im just happy to greet you to our fair
city Do you require anyone to help you around
Show you the grounds
 Well for a days work that would merely
run you a paltry two gold pieces
 I am Ulysses Stanneras Ive lived here my
entire life Im a purveyor of all the great sites
and sounds of the city and it would be my
pleasure
 They have watches  There is
clockwork in this
 Well there is a small tunnel maybe about
several hundred feet above itll give us some
break from the rain
 Of course
 Make an ins 
 Yeah you may
 I love this so much
 Or not Youre welcome to wander as you
see fit but I was just merely willing to help
 He takes the edges and daintily holds the
cloak open presentery style and hes dressed in
very fine clothing like a nice coat thats
buttoned with a little cravat and fine trousers
Or at least they were at one point the edges are
a little tattered It looks like his one nice
suit that hes had for maybe  years and its
definitely seen some rough days You get the
sense from this whole package here that either
he feigns some level of prominence or has fallen
very hard from it
 Yes
 Make an intimidation check with advantage
 He goes
 Well first off thats terribly
rude affecting me with any sort of arcanebased
nature enchantments upon first meeting you when
Ive been so gracious
 But do you pay
 Then I think we will do quite well working
together
 I know better than to cross anyone with
a
 Well then shall we get out of this rain
Follow me He closes his cloak and begins to dart
with a really rapid gait further down the road and
then turn off to the right You can now see the
city Beyond the outer wall it looks like there
are a number of perimeter walls that have arches
between them almost like under a bridge and
there are constructs houses that are built
through those gaps and in these small tunnels that
are maybe  to  feet in length but you know
 foot wide where these large separation barriers
are and you can see along the top there are carts
that move on their own along these wall tops and
it catches your eyes One of them shifts down its curious
 Kind of
 He guides you underneath one of these
arches
 Yeah there are people wandering through
Its just where one of the streets turns off to
it It sounded a lot shadier when he presented it
than it was but its more just like a brief
respite from where people are walking through and
occasionally you see a couple crownsguard that
come through passing
 Oh thats all right
 Thats impressive Mighty Nein He pulls
his hood back and he has this Benjamin Franklin
skullet going on where there its curly wavy
gray hair but its balding on top and he throws
the cloak over one shoulder So now that youve
arrived Whats your business here What can I
help you with What do you want to see What can I
show you
 Both of those you can probably find in the
Pentamarket
 Pentamarket
 It would have probably some of the finer
inks yes The finest you could probably find
there or in the TriSpires
 TriSpires
 There are a few places you could go yes
Actually if were going towards the Pentamarket
your best luck there would be the Invulnerable
Vagrant Yes
 Yes
 That would probably be at the Archive
 Yes
 The Archive of the Cobalt Soul here in the
city Its a library that is maintained by a
number of believers But as long as youre not
taking anything from within and you have approved
entry and are heavily watched within for the most
part you can peruse the content of the interior
 I mean Im sure there are but I would not
bother myself with such base interests of reading
 Make an insight check
 My pleasure
 Then perhaps if you find your way somehow
into the TriSpires southern quarter somewhere
in the vicinity of Let me look it up real fast
Look at my own notes
 On the southern side of the Silken Terrace
youll find a place known as Chastitys Nook That
may be where youll find what youre looking for
friend
 The Leaky Tap you say Well its
affordable
 Fair enough fair enough The Leaky Tap
thatll be in the East Outersteads actually Bit
of a rowdy clientele
 Its bawdy and fun
 For your clientele
 That could be You guys are really
 The Steams Respite
 Thats what Im here for
 That is He glances quickly over towards
Caleb You arent planning to stay there are you
 They work for a certain clientele
 Those who live in the TriSpire or can
afford to stay at the Well youre welcome to try
 You could say that yes
 Not anymore
 I was a man about town yes
 Well things change Life changes Partners
disappear with your businesss goods and funds and
leave you having to make a living showing people
around the city
 Its very sad I know But anyway
 We used to run a business that sold and
traded leathers but I was ousted and Ive been
scraping by ever since
 I was more of a business connection if you
will My partner was the crafter I knew a few
things Id picked up throughout the years but
 Put it this way Strangely enough I make
half as much with a quarter of the emphasis doing
what Im doing for you now
 A lot of people come through town
 It can be You can look for work You can
head to the He points out here This would be
The Signet Wall if youre more of a sellsword
 The Signet Wall Thats where the military
stays and most of the Crownsguard are holed up
 The Pentamarket would be a place where you
could find There is the Spark Hammer Smithing
that would be of aid to you Theres also
Packwearers Provisions but theyre more of a
smaller scale smithing goods tools and such
 And looking up at the sky it appears the
sun has set which means my purchased day is done
Its been an absolute pleasure
 Well it appears that our business
transaction has come to an end If you would like
to rent another day Id be happy to answer your
questions
 He leans forward to you with a closer look
He goes Maybe
 Make a deception check
 The fact that that was your lie scares him
more than believing it couldve ever done He
goes Very well Enjoy your stay at the Leaky
Tap Ill be on my way He throws his hood up and
darts back out into the rain
 Okay You guys are making your way towards
the East Outersteads
 Youd have to curve around to do that Do
you want to
 You dont know Well youve been here
 You havent spent a lot of time in Zadash
In fact probably the last thing you did before
your family said Come home was here You know
it a little bit Youve been to the Pentamarket
you would be able to guide the rest of them
through the Pentamarket if you wanted to
 Yeah Some of them do some of them dont
Some merchants prefer to use the night for revelry
and spending some of what they made for the day
Some know that those who drink and revel sometimes
make poor choices in their purchases so it can
vary
 As you guys wander through the cold rain
making your way aside from you perhaps this is
the largest city any of you have visited
Comparable to Port Damali but much taller Damali
was a little more spread out This has
architecture and buildings that are designed to
rise and almost seem to curve when youre looking
up at it In certain moments if youre not
careful it can give a hint of vertigo just at
the height of some of these structures
 Yeah thats a good way to put it
Rexxentrum is still easily twice the size of this
city As you make your way outside of the
Pentamarket and its called this because central
to Zadash a number of the streets that bisect it
naturally carved a pentagonal shape and the
interior between all these streets has since
become the center of most merchant business and
theres a bazaar set up in the center of that
pentashape where carts and tents and buildings
are out there all day every day Its an open
market As youre making your way through the
rain some of them are closing early Some of them
are closing up because of the weather and its
not going as well as most days would when it isnt
so freezing You can see your breath escaping from
you with each exhale You ask around a bit Make
an investigation check as youre guiding the troupe
 Easy enough You ask around You see a few
folks that seem to be locals or at least who
often find their way through this district They
lead you over towards a large building of stained
wood and greengold velvet hanging on the outside
The first thought is that velvets going to get
ruined in this rain As you approach the exterior
of it the building is untouched It is dry You
do glance up and you can see carved delicately
into a wood placard above the doors which are
currently closed but little slips of glass in
each door reveal a warm lit interior thats
glowing from the inside out It says The
Invulnerable Vagrant
 Okay Whos entering
 You guys staying out
 Okay As you enter the interior of the
building its warm Its very warm and its a
nice change of pace You immediately throw your
cloak back as the temperature shift causes you 
everyone but you actually youre pretty
comfortable in the cold to immediately throw
your heavy layers back On the immediate entry
you can see theres lanterns all throughout the
chamber that are hanging up above flickering
candlelight but they all flicker like theres
wind when theres none You also notice that all
of them are floating Theyre little glass
chambers that contain the candle and theyre all
slowly gyrating held in place Inside the chamber
you can see a long table that has a few small
books laid out On a velvet raised platform
theres a long blade like a rapier of some kind
It looks jeweled and gorgeous In the back there
appears to be a shelf with books and books and
books with a desk You see three figures two of
which are facing away behind the desk The one
that is closest to you turns around to make your
appearance You see a large sevenfoot tall
humanoid figure Short bushy curly brown hair
fros up a little bit The body is very fine
grayish brown fur And their nose is wide almost
like a cow or a bulls nose across a human face
The chins a bit square and the physicality is
hunched and theres just a big smile on the face
 Make a nature check
 You have not encountered this folk before in
your travels Its rare to see them ingrained in
society this close Firbolgs
 Yeah they are usually a more naturebased
freespirited people that live more towards the
mountains of the northern forests in the Greying
Wildlands and beyond To see one here in society
catches you offguard let alone one thats
dressed so well You can see these long elegant
robes of deep green and gold and this big smile on
his face as he spins around Yes Im happy to
help you
 Yeah You know of them
 Yeah
 Before we can get to that I just have to
say youre respectfully terribly filthy And
this is an establishment that I have to insist
requires some more cleanliness As he waves his
hand in front of you you watch as all the dirt on
your coat just begins to sift away Your clothing
becomes clean right up the front of you reaching
up towards your neck The dirt begins to fleck
away across your face
 As you fight it a moment passes and you see
before you for the first time since youve met a
sparkly clean Caleb
 Oh youre just an excitable little friend
there arent you This giant hand goes down and
pats you on the head
 At this point the two other figures in the
back turn around and its the same guy
 Theres two more of the same firbolg The
same outfit Same exact visual They both go
Hi Hi
 Ho ho ho Well thats just impressive
 He reaches out and puts his hand out to
shake your hand Whats your name
 And whats your name
 It goes through her hand
 Oh thats an illusion Okay Im Enchanter
Pumat Sol And this I am also Enchanter Pumat
Sol And the third one goes I myself am also
Enchanter Pumat Sol
 The fourth ones in the back
 Theres the prime Pumat Sol and the three
of us are what you would call magically manifested
duplicates to aid in his work
 Well Welcome to the establishment
 The
Invulnerable Vagrant greets all of you humbly
 Oh we have both of those things come with
me He turns around and you can see now as he
turns around his head is about to smack into one
of these candles and he just knowing where it
is Hes been so practiced he just ducks under it
and continues walking toward the back He needs
some Oh I heard him He turns around and
takes down a couple of inkwells and sets them in
front The other one is pulling out stacks of
paper and parchment and is stacking them up and
they set them there All right so how much do
you need of how much of each
 You say this now
 No thats comparably respectfully a
paltry sum We can get that paper to you When you
used in the ritualistic design and presentation of
arcane symbols scribes and glyphs Or you
looking for ink that itself is actually enchanted
for various uses and manifestation
 Oh thats some wizard stuff Okay we can
do that

 He goes ahead and they muster the paper and
ink that will easily be utilized for scribing
 We have a few in stock actually You want
to and hes like Im already on it Then he
turns around and pulls out a large eight vial
collecting case that he sets on the table Thats
one there And theres another Weve got a
variety of vials at your disposal so let us know
what youre looking for
 That Lets see here That would put you
back about  gold pieces for a single vial
 A general
 Thatll put you at a simple  gold
pieces
 It would be my pleasure Mr Green Man
 Whats your name by the way
 Fjord Pleasure to meet you
 Im sorry I didnt mean to disrespect your
invitation there Whats your name
 Nice to meet you
 Youre small
 Of course
 Make a persuasion check
 Im sorry but this is a business No
discounts but were happy to sell for the price
of  gold apiece
 All righty thank you very much
 Pumat Sol
 We deal with all sorts of enchanted items
He turns as one of the other guys over there goes
Ive got it We have all manner of objects that
weve crafted enchanted and designed
 Oh are you looking to sell or trade
 Well lets go ahead and clear off He
takes the vials off the counter and they set a
space and the three of them sit around You hear
this voice behind this thick curtain go Is
anybody able to help me here for a minute Right
there The two of you continue this One of them
goes in the back room to help the fourth one
 Thats Pumat Prime Hes the real guy But
anyway lets have a look at this You put down
the glaive you said This isnt too bad Hand
me the item card
 With that they happily pass over to you
your purchased parchment and ink
 This is pretty well made for being such a
ghastlylooking design I think it could easily
use some fine gold gilding maybe some extra
polishing Put some ribbons on it and this thing
would be a great ceremonial piece The manticore
spines I think are a little garish personally
but if youre looking to sell we could give this
to you for about  gold
 Go for it
 Mind you if were doing it for trade
prices can be a little more in your favor but
understand Im a business for profit
 Thats adorable And Im not going to lie
I like it better

  gold But for trade Ill probably be
able to muster a little more What are you looking for
 Let me have a look here and see what we can
muster Youre looking for something that could
you traveling type Is that right
 A briefcase of carrying
 Ill tell you what If you give me this
here majestic weapon with the ribbon included
and an additional  gold pieces on top of that
trade I can just go ahead and the other guy
whos wandered away goes We can take this here
fantastic haversack off the wall and make it yours
 Let me show you He sets it down and its
this
 Its a backpack with a bunch of various
pouches and things that are latched onto it
Theres two side pouches on it beyond the big
central one He opens it up takes the glaive
and Watch this and it disappears into it He
reaches in pulls the glaive out
 It sticks in there The big central pouch
He goes The side ones dont carry as much but
the central side of it does manage to carry about
eight cubic feet of material in an
extradimensional space to call it whenever you
require it Two cubic feet for both of the side
pouches I enchanted it Well he enchanted it We
sell it
 Make a persuasion check
 I appreciate your gusto Were perhaps we
had more of a business relationship together I
would consider such a deal but as this is the
first real transaction and time in which we have
encountered you and your band of oncefilthy
travelers Im going to have to decline
 So is that a deal
 Give me just a moment He turns around and
disappears behind the curtain and you hear some
talking Some  Another
one emerges from behind the curtain who has this
leather band on his head with this large
magnifyingtype tool hanging in front of him with
this big smile on his face He has these thick
leather gloves that have a bunch of runes on them
He goes Im sorry I was summoned to make
something prettier
 Whats your favorite color
  He finishes and he
watches the haversack suddenly shimmers past and
the dull general brown leather turns to a
bright vibrant pink
 You hand it to the one guy who accepts it
All right good I hope you enjoy it Im going
to get back to work Keep it up me He goes in
the back room He takes the glaive off The other
guy says All right thank you very much Any
other business you require
 Theres plenty of vendors With the raining
outside and so late probably hard to find
pastries tonight but fresh in the morning just
let your nose carry you around The Pentamarket
has plenty
 It would be my pleasure
 Theyre probably still working You can
maybe convince them to take a conversation
 No worries Just listen for the clanging
and the sparks All right if thats all I wish
you all adieu come back any time Were happy to
sell buy trade and generally help out anyone
who has money
 Its my pleasure
 Oh yeah No especially with it so cold
outside you can see there were two different
carts that had small potheated basic alcohol
and ciders
 Winters Crest is actually only celebrated
in TalDorei It does not have cultural
significance here in Wildemount I believe you are
three to four months out from it Ill have to
check the calendar You guys are just now cresting
into the beginning of fall
 As you guys step outside you are
immediately met by Beauregard and Molly who have
come back with some small wooden cups filled with
heated steaming mulled wine and a small care
package of baked goods Which would mark you guys
off at about Id say total of six silver for the bunch
 How many did you buy
 You may have to come back and buy more tarts
in the morning
 I was going to say because you guys got to
get going pretty soon What we can do is we can
say at this point in the evening it looks like
the blacksmithy is currently closed off to any
sort of waresselling Theyre in the process of
creation You can hear the banging but upon
knocking they dont stop their stride of whatever
sort of work theyre doing inside with the anvil
The rain begins to let up a little bit Its still
sprinkling but at least the heavy downpour has
subsided a bit You make your way through the
slushy mud pits that the streets have become
weaving your way between horses and various wagons
being pulled through individuals that are hooded
and bundled making their way around Eventually
discovering the outskirts of the Leaky Tap As you
guys step into the warm interior pulling your
hoods back well pick up on that next week Weve
got these guys have way too early flights to go to
this convention tomorrow
 Its about an hour and a half past dusk
 Just world building Probably fever dream
while Im working on this stuff
  Just come back and try and
buy and trade for more things You know where to
find them
 Awesome Thank you guys Well pick it up

 As we do with every guest Give him the
Critter hug Yeah guys have a wonderful week
rest up and is it Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back Last we left off the newly
decidedupon title for this adventuring group was
announced to Bryce and as such you are now
referred to as the Mighty Nein
 The Mighty No in Zemnian
 Upon finishing your business in Alfield you
acquired your new cart new horses and found your
way on the Amber Road northward for a number of
days making your way toward Zadash Along the
way you had some curious naps you found some
cool little landmarks from a war long past you
were nearly robbed and instead shooed them off
with cries of extreme syphilis and then entered
the gates of Zadash yourselves Upon which you
briefly met a character named Ulysses who
offered at a bit of cost to show you around town
for the remainder of the day Unfortunately the
sun set within the next couple of hours but you
were led toward the Pentamarket where you did a
little bit of shopping offloaded some things
youd acquired in your previous venture in the
mines where you battled the gnolls encountered a
purveyor of various magical artifacts named
Enchanter Pumat Sol acquired some baked goods
from the market and then finished up by making
your way to The Leaky Tap where you had just
begun to cross the threshold when we left off last
week With that coming in out of the nowcold
night air mouths filled with various crumbs and
residue of sweets having been consumed on the
walk you enter the darkened interior of The Leaky
Tap Now The Leaky Tap itself is a simple but
very large tavern You can see theres space here
for at least a dozen tables and chairs and stools
crowded around While it lacks decor it seems to
have charm with a rather rattylooking band in
the corner thats playing mostly onkey It
appears that a number of people who have found
their way this is the Eastern Outersteads I
believe have wandered in to spend whatever
coppers they want to throw towards a drink to send
their cares away for the evening andor argue
with each other about how better to make the day
before them Upon stepping into the chamber you
can see theres already about  patrons scattered
amongst the tables and the evening appears to be
slowly crawling to more of a roar Theres chatter
and whispers theres laughter and the clanks of
metal and glass You can see already theres one
long bar on the far end of the room that is broken
in the center for a number of entryway hatches
and two busied bartenders rushing back and forth
What do you guys want to do
 Theres always tomorrow
 Make a perception check
  okay Glancing about most of the
patrons in here range from somewhat dusty
destitute clothing that looks to be torn and
ragged at the edges Some can be farm hands but
most of the farm work youve seen is done on the
outskirts of the outer walls of Zadash but youve
also walked through folks in the street that sit
on the side peddling handcrafted wares and
whatever they can muster to try and make ends meet
on the outskirts of the city proper You notice
two fairly dressed individuals compared to the
rest that are in the process of doing a quick game
of cards You can see a large group of people that
are just beginning to gather and keeping an eye
out towards the door if anybody else they
recognize is going to come in Looks to be about
eight or so strong with younger halfelf woman or
so who as you guys enter sees you glances over
then shakes her head and goes back to
conversation
 Oh straight up You can see the whole
banner on the
 Cast Identify on that
 The attunement process is a little weird
Anyway
 You do see one of the barkeeps leaves behind
and gives a finger off to the other one to pick up
the slack The one leaving looks to be an elven
woman what would look to be the equivalent of a
human s or so so who knows how long her actual
elven age is Looks graceful looking a bit
disheveled hair pulled back and tied into a small
haphazard bun simple apron washing up her hands
and toweling them off as she passes off the full
bar to a male dragonborn Whitescaled plump
physique he himself is wearing a similar apron
with a big smile on his face He seems jolly
rushing back and forth taking orders filling
drinks and looks like even though hes a bit
stressed at the moment having to take the slack
is handling it with a smile and is used to the
usual evening ruckus
 They seem to be yeah
 At that point and hand comes up and he
goes Excuse me just a moment Fills up two
tankards on the side slides them down a bit
grabs a couple silver pockets it comes back
 Turns back to you and maybe a good solid
inch or two taller than you a burlylooking
dragonborn
 With a dangerouslooking front of the snout
that as soon as it spins to you and he looks at
you with this big toothy grin you can see scars
in areas where its been split in the past This
guys seen some rough action in his past But as
soon as the large dragon mouth curls up into this
smile the golden yellow eyes peeking from behind
these stark white scales themselves look a bit
dusty
 Yes Right so what can I do for you
 Oh food and drink I can go ahead and get
started at least get the order in the kitchen
Pick a table sit a spell rack up You paying up
front or you like a tab
 Oh How many rooms you looking 
Ill be right with you hold your shit Yes
 Looks under the counter real fast Pulls out
a small board
 Oh we got plenty weve got like seven of
them open Three rooms and a tab under the
name
 Theres six of you
 Oh Zemnian Fucking weird All right
 Me Im Wessek the Trim
 Purveyor of the bar here
 No he is a plump dragonborn
 He has lived a happy midlife Im purveyor
of drinks and keeper of food here at the Leaky
Tap Happy to get your food orders in get some
drinks to your table Sit back relax Theres
usually a show at some point in the night
 Make a perception check
 No In fact from your height just a lot of
bums
 A whole lot of butts in there
 You do not see any halforcs in this bar As
you go over to the table the two gentlemen who
are playing cards you sit down and glance One of
them looks to be an older man in his s or so
his pattern baldness curling back but has this
curled mush of brown now graying hair on the
outskirts of it Hes wearing a billowing shirt of
a nicer silk Thats why it caught your eye These
two seem not extremely welloff by any means but
at least better than a lot of the other riffraff
that are finding their way in including you
guys
 Your dress is pretty nice youre right
Thats true The other one is in the process of
heavily concentrating on his hand This one looks
a lot younger He has this scraggly mustache It
looks like hes probably been growing it since
childhood and has let it go in its glory He has
a buttonup high collar bit and a cravat that has
loosened and fallen Both of these gentlemen upon
a closer look look like theyre dressing up
beyond their station and at the end of the night
have come to alleviate their stresses with drink
and yelling at each other over cards
 Yes
 They both stop midconversation and glance
over Were playing whatever suits us at the
moment Were in the midst 
 Well we are in the moment finishing a
quick game of poker If you would be so kind as to
leave us to our game in peace that would be
appreciated
 Make a deception check
  The younger one who was talking to you
glances over to the older gentleman whos in the
process of glancing back and they take a moment
and they both look back to you together I
suppose if you want to buy in then that is your
choice
 They wordlessly continue the game They
begin arguing over the process of rising prices
between irons coming down from the Druvenlode
city which is one of the larger mining cities in
the empire They begin to also discuss the quality
of alcohol seems to be diminishing the more they
drink Eventually with one final hand the
younger one slaps down his cards and the older
one in frustration goes Fine You win
 What do you wish to play
 For the sake of ease of the sudden card
game he looks around at the other guy Do you
know the CrickQueens Call
 Very well then He goes to shuffle the
cards rather rapidly before he begins dealing out
the early sets
 You may make a perception check
 Make a perception check
 There are rafters yeah Its not a very
high peaked ceiling The actual roofing element of
this at least begins about twelve feet up and
theres a small space before the beams meet the
top
 All right
 It seems to be a clean shuffle and a clean
deal
 Both the guys look at each other again
their eyes a little wide Two gold would suffice
yes Of course
 He strokes his waytoosoft mustache
 Two gold on the table from each of you so
thats six gold in the full pot Go ahead and make
your roll d
 Everyone rolls and then you can raise your
ante
 Make a sleight of hand check
  Okay
 Sure make a perception check
 No you do not They all look at their
hands The younger one with the mustache keeps
stroking the front of his face and goes Ill
raise four You dont roll yet You have to raise
first
 Oh you were Yes youre right
 You just roll again
 He goes Raising an additional two gold
pieces
 I know All right They meet your raise
Thats now  gold I believe on the table so
you all get to draw another card So reroll one more
The older one
 No he stays
 Perception check
  Yeah you can see
 The younger one has a crap hand Hes trying
to bluff and hes already sweating a bit The
older one is looking really good
 Well the mustache is the younger one The
older one is
 All right so go attempt it again Go and
roll a deception or sorry sleight of hand
 You guys are so honed in on this
 The young guy is sweating a bit and he gets
more nervous He just continues to stroke his
little caterpillar mustache quicker and smaller
bits The older guy who seems to be playing rather
spacey the whole time suddenly zooms in on your
hands and goes I do say I think were being
had
 He leans forward and pulls one of the cards
that you had slipped into your sleeve out onto
the table
 The old guy stands up and leans forward You
can see he has this bloodshot corners a little
bit where the white show for deep brown irises
The smell of alcohol and dirt wafts off of him as
he leans forward I will not report you for
cheating but we will taking the rest of the pot
 He just takes the coins and scoops them up
 They get up and leave
 Dinner arrives drinks have been provided
You guys are able to use your meal and figure out
who you want to talk to what you want to do your
business
 Sheed
 As youre shouting this out some people
start looking over curious as this very
ostentatiously dressed tiefling starts shouting
essentially the owner of the tavern out in the
center of the tavern No one seems to make any
physical action towards it However Wessek points
over towards you Oh she took some time off
Shes up in her office sorry
 Yeah you guys have eaten And now youre in
the process you dont have to roleplay every meal

 At this point its probably pushing close
to ten oclock
 The suns been set for a couple hours
 Theres a brief spiral staircase towards the
far back that leads to a landing and then the
second floor From the outside you could see 
there were three floors to it So this probably
progresses theres another staircase further
down the hallway From the landing up there
theres a single doorway that is currently closed
It has no name on it but it stands alone from the
rest of it and it seems to be in the direction as
to where Wessek was pointing
 At a quick glance the one on the landing
 Weve been hanging out far too long This is
a problem Theres a moment Yes who is it
 More information please
 Bryce who
 All right just a moment please About 
or so seconds pass and the door opens and the same
elven woman you saw leave from behind the bar
earlier However the disheveled appearance you saw
earlier is gone is pristine clean and the hair
is immaculately combed and pulled up into a high
bun wearing a deep maroon almost a silk robe
that is pulled over arms across
 Oh fair enough So you are friends of
Bryce
 Well they are a very good friend And if
you are friends of them then you are friends of
mine I ask you to enter for the time being and
perhaps we can get to know each other I suppose
if you have business Enter please She turns and
whips around and heads back inside This office is
a simple office When you consider most of the
offices youve encountered have been in some level of
empire clerical work andor in various
institutions this is mainly just a desk with a
chair some books and ledger information some
scattered papers ink and quill a few books on
the side Other than that its pretty barren and
simple There is a window in the back that has a
crossbeam bisecting it into four squares It is just
pitch black outside cause the rest of it is just
an alley below Anyway she turns around and sits
in the chair and comes back and crosses her hands
in front of her with her elbows on the edge of the
table All right you have my attention What can
I do for you
 You are here looking for work Well for
one if you are in need of paying work I always
have dishes to wash But at a quick glance at how
you are presented as a little more capable
individuals at first glance I would say that
perhaps you have other skills So I would
 If you are better with a blade or
information then checking at the Kings Hall Board
might be a solid bet for you
 Every person you meet is the right and the
wrong person depending on where you are coming from
 I guess I would ask what for you is the
wrong type of people
 Right then perhaps do not punch any
crownsguard and I think youll be okay
 I mean individuals yes Theres a brief
moment where she looks wistfully into the
distance Ive had my encounters not so much
with Crownsguard but with other figures
 Oh Ive already made sure their ass has
been thoroughly kicked
 She crosses her arms for a second
Interesting point Where are you from Have you
always lived in the empire
 From the Menagerie Coast You are in for a
treat of comparably colorful times But a probably
less jovial atmosphere in places You know about
the religious control correct
 There are for well over a century now the
worship of various deities in the empire has been
controlled There are shrines throughout the city
Most cities contain a shrine of some kind to the
approved worships I just want to ensure that if
you do not fall into this realm you do not go
flashing it about because that will get you very
easily put into the Umber Dungeon and that is not
a place you want to be
 They are scattered about For instance
there is the Allhammer Their shrine is let me
think for a second as I consult my notes
 The Umber Dungeon There is the Hearth of
the Allhammer that is existing in the Pentamarket
 Look for the domed iron structure It may
be a bit rusty not in the best upkeep Its hard
to miss the interior with the very heavy
beautiful anvil for both craftwork of those that
maintain a position What else do you want
to know about it There is the Ravens Den which
is in the center of the graveyard
 The Ossuary Gates is the multilayered
catacomb graveyard The Ravens Den exists in the
center area of that field
 Midday and depending on which places of
worship they are yes But there are Heralds that
run each shrine they work for the empire They
hold all sermons They give council to anybody who
requires it Its all pretty much within the
government structure yes
 Not visibly no There are many people that
work underneath the law here but they are careful
enough if they wish to continue business to not
show it I mean what are you looking for that
kind of work
 You should be fine Its you should be
fine
 For the most part those of various unique
heritages have harder times at the farther
eastern areas around the garrisons Those that
have to keep the creatures of Xhorhas at bay and
possibly historians that believe that this is the
Curse of Ghor Dranas but you know For the most
part most nobody studies history and just consider
you either uniquelooking or will avoid you regardless
 If youre looking for a comparison here it
would be upperend public school if anything
 Sure well put it at a charter school
 But controlled by the Soltryce Academy
 Yes The head tutor there is an overworked
and relatively stressedout individual
 Yes Mikael Drom Very nice fellow Eager
to help but the system has been difficult for him
 There is There is a Platinum House That
would also be in the Interstead Sprawl Look for
the beautiful white building with deep blue
tapestries on the outside Theyre reflective
mirrorlike during the day Its almost a beacon
for having to shield your eyes Meditation
worship is all available within there Sermons
usually around noon
 Anything that isnt the Platinum Dragon
the Raven Queen Allhammer Dawnfather Lawbearer
and the Knowing Mistress
 There are six
 I dont judge If you worship what you want
you can just be careful about it
 Dont tell anyone
 Very well
 Thats going to help you Anything else you
want to know Ive been living here most of my life
 Kings Hall is a good resource If youre
really hit up hard and you want to try the route
that Bryce did you can always sign up to become a
member of the military
 It works well for some people It pays you
are trained The Righteous Brand is very helpful
and helps keep the Empire safe from the terrors
that wander in and beyond the borders
 There are plenty of underbellies but they
are localized scattered and very protective
Keep your ears open ask the right questions
 I dont trust anybody Thats how Im still
alive and thats how I came to own this tavern
 Thank you
 I had to change it a bit The man I took it
all from I wanted him to leave nothing behind
 Theres a quick glance in your direction
Her expression darkens and she goes No but I
would be very careful how you use that name
 I do not know him but I know of him That
thing I said about trying not to get in trouble
with the darker elements of the city that might be
in over your head That is very specifically one
who wallows in that mire
 Yes basically wallows in the mire of the
underbelly shit Sounds like a fun lyric
 Wallows in the mire of the underbelly
shit
 Very well I will walk you down
 Yes
 Oh right
 Sure You can do it now while theyre
exiting the office While theyve been in there
 So far so good Well see how it
progresses As you guys exit the office at the
bottom of the stair you can see that group that
was gathering earlier with the young girl that was
looking out towards the entryway is there waiting
at the base of the stair
 Yeah the bachelorette party if
you will
Though it was a mixed group As soon as
you exit with Claudia they notice her notice
you and all step back for a moment and wait As
you step down the stairs a young halfelf girl
freckled auburn hair a smudged face of a hard
days work leans forward and goes Terribly
sorry Claudia Are we good to use the cellar for
the meeting Yes of course It is available to
you right now Not a problem She goes All
right thank you very much She turns around and
begins gathering up the crew You can see a few
people at the bar shes slowly gathering the folk
until theres a cluster of about  or so They
all begin making their way towards where the
kitchen is into a pantry area
 Youre going to have to follow to find out
 Oh
 She goes No not so much They are
passionate political debaters
 No I am merely providing a space for
people that are wanting to work through some
difficulties they have with their lifestyle That
is all
 The two of you have wrapped up for the time
being
 The cat whos been following Fjord and
Beauregard you guys have been having this
conversation as you follow down to the cellar As
you descend down the cellar stairs you can hear
conversation and a few voices passing They all
get quiet As you step and descend past where the
ceiling of the basement reveals you the group of
 folks are all gathered around with a central
podium on an elevated step or a box Theyre all
looking at you quiet The one whos standing on
the box is a human man probably in his early s
or so Shorter hair graying but a little unkempt
in the face Hes got smaller spectacles at the
edge of his nose and unshaved stubble against his
chin but hes dressed in a nice white shirt
tucked in well and looks thin and wellmannered
He puts his hand up and goes Hey there Can we
help you
 Everyone looks at each other Theres an
ornery dwarf fella who looks over to the guy in
the top and shakes his head The halfelven girl
who was gathering the group gives a nudge toward
you with a smile and says We can at least ask
He goes All right well step on up The crowd
separates a little bit as you guys approach Im
curious Share with me briefly the joys the Empire
has brought to your life
 Be honest
 Make a persuasion check with advantage with
his help
 You seem to be on the level We are a group
called the Knights of Requital and we are
discussing methods of changing the current
political unhappiness in the city of Zadash and beyond
 Very well I will continue with my talk if
you dont mind
 No Looking around the room most of the
folks in here look to be saltoftheearth folk of
the city A few folks look to be a little more
wealthy lowertomiddle class if you were to give
any sort of comparison there and they all look
like theyre a bit riled up The dwarf who had
eyed you up previously his eyes have these heavy
bags under them hes got this scraggly unkempt
brown beard and very short almost buzzcut hair
on top Hes glaring at the two of you He steps
away from the crowd and keeps a very close eye
The gentleman at the top First off to our new
conversationalists I am Dolan Thrym As many of
you know her I once ran a very successful physician
practice here in the Interstead Sprawl one that
my partner was the head physician Well he was
unfortunately brought to an unearned level of
shame and his practice ruined as well as our
industry by the house of Sutan naught but a year ago
We went from a comfortable living helping people
to a life of squalor and shame I know were not
the only one as now the son of the house of
Sutan Ren sits at the top of that practice Took
all of our clients and squeezes them for all of
their worth And I for one am sick of it
Everybody else in the group goes 
 Im sick of it and we cant sit back and
let nothing be done about it Now would you like
to take the floor Ulog The dwarf who was
watching you guys takes his doesnt leave you
for a moment before he steps over and the crowd
separates and he steps up onto the small block
which at his height puts him about head level with
most of the crowd As many of you know I was a
woodworker for many years carving wood did good
carpentry My wife Illiana is a good wife
About six months ago she was up late at night
picking up food for the night for the two of
us in the Pentamarket She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time There were some street bandits
outside the TriSpires They stabbed someone who
had run in ran clean into my wife just as the
Crownsguard descended She got looped in with
them thrown in jail I went and fought There
wasnt even a bit of a trial The HighRictor sent
her straight to the Umber Dungeon sentenced her
 years for this business Its been six months
now I cant even see her Im sick of it and I
think its time we did something Everyone in the
crowd goes 
 This continues one after another
individuals start coming up and talking about
resharing stories for the newcomers Things that
have come up recently that frustrate them They
begin throwing things around like instability
within the Starostas capable hands to maintain a
political structure in a city this large They
begin to talk on anger and frustration with the
lack of proper education for the masses keeping
them unable to climb status and eke out of living
and thus are forced into the military to die out
on the fields of Xhorhas There have been
discussions about frustration dealing with the
ever creeping power scale of whats called the
Cerberus Assembly and influence that stretches
from Rexxentrum into the city itself Eventually
it begins to rise into many voices clamoring out
in frustration and once again Dolan the softer
gentleman at the beginning puts his hands up and
But were going to find a way I have friends that
Ive made people that were talking to and we
have hopefully a new beginning soon an
opportunity where I think we can have a voice in
the politics here I hope to have more for you
soon in the meantime try and keep your chin up
I know its hard now but I believe well have an
opportunity soon Thank you Thank you to Kara
who has been helping set these meetings up
Points over to the younger halfelf earlier and she nods
and a few hands clap And to our new members
Im sorry I didnt get your names
 Beau and Fjord thank you for joining us
tonight It goes without saying please if you
dont mind we prefer to keep these conversations
personal For obvious reasons
 If even the most misunderstood discontent
leads to unfortunate circumstances
 Of course Thats requital I appreciate
your time Rest well well meet soon Dismissed
Everyone begins to scatter and make their way back
up to the tavern
 Yeah of course I understand that you
arent from around here so dont feel that you
have to take too much of this to heart Best we
can do to try and keep spirits up I believe that
we can find a way to exact some change real
soon
 Well were scheduled to meet here in the
next two days or so Were gearing up for a couple
of important events
 It can vary Anyway Im sorry I really
should be going
 Oh I live outside of the Apple Tree
Tutors
 Appreciate you being respectful and close
to your chest Anyway He steps past the two of
you puts the rest of his jacket on and exits
Now its just the two of you there in the cellar below
 There are large casks large wooden barrels
and casks This is where major ale storage is set
but none of them are tapped It looks to be full
of crates that are still sealed unopened
 None of the wines are kept in this cellar
 By the size of the place you get the sense
theres probably more than one storage place here
 
 Easy enough to do
 As you guys head up into the tavern to meet
up with the rest of your troop you see theyre all
sitting around handling their other business
What are you guys up to
 You got the meat of it You watched the
people that were in the meeting leave in small
groups Theyre pacing their exits
 All righty What else are you guys doing
 You can go and try and find out
 All righty
 Right Now the two of you make an
investigation check
 Thats right Shes coming as well
 You do manage to discover the location of
The Steams Respite but it is closed for the
night It is too late for its functionality
 If you wander through the Pentamarket which
you can go roundabout to do that
 On the way from where you are exiting there
none of those no The Pentamarket is pretty much
this cluster at the center of
 You wouldve come across more small food
establishments like small dumpling establishments
Nothing too crazy It looks like most of the
stores that are on the outskirts would be simple
glassware the occasional basic blacksmiths for
putting horseshoes on and the construction of
that simple armor repairs for whoever needs it
 Nothing crazy Most of the good stuff is in
the vicinity youve already been
 It makes sense when youre over 

 All right So you guys find your way back
What about the rest of you guys anything
 Easily enough You have it copied over
without issue
 How many did you make
 Well say ten and a few that didnt quite
you got halfway through and like frustrated
noise tore it up Okay cool So the rest of you
guys are you all resting for the evening
 All right Night rest comes without issue
You awake in the morning to the sound of an
already muttering tavern floor below you The
smell of food and whatever dried ale has been
spilled into the room that youre currently
sleeping in But the day is yours the morning has
arrived you are welcome to do what you wish
 You get your food your breakfast set Lets
see here Well say for the two meals and the
drinks and the three rooms overnight If you want
to keep track of the tab Though you havent paid
it yet necessarily if youre staying for a
while
 Put you at
 Ill put you at at the three rooms food
and drink at about six gold so far
 This isnt the nicer part of town
 All right So
 At the moment no Looks like it is your
dragonborn friend and theres maybe six people in
the room
 Right good morning
 Thats all right
 Theres probably a few places with
libraries Theres the Archive
 Yeah Theres also the Hall of Erudition
Im pretty sure they got libraries as well
 Yeah its where the Soltryce
Academysacademyis here
 Right that would be lets see right
around Hmm  Let me make sure I get
this correct for internal consistency Ah that
would be in the Interstead Sprawl If you consider
the citys triangular shape theres the pentagram
market offcenter and a little bit to the west of
it and then theres the East and West
Outersteads which are the outside cusp and the
slums and the outside of the main wall theres
the TriSpire which is up north then theres a
section a quadrant over here its a military
section in this weird ring that surrounds and
bisects them all around the Pentamarket Thats
the Interstead Sprawl
 Yeah Well no thats the more
middleclass central connecting part that holds
the rest of the city together
 The library is there
 From where you are now you guys are in the
Eastern Outersteads it would be west And he
goes Actually  hold on just a second Ill
get to your meal Follow me He comes out from
behind the bar and slaps it up and puts an arm
around your shoulder and leads you right
immediately outside to the front of the tavern
pushing you along
 He goes You look over that rooftop there
and you can see that  and you see this slowly
tapering tower that then curves off at the very
top to be a very domelike pinnacle The stonework
itself appears to be like a smooth concrete
looking texture just from this distance and the
way the morning sun is hitting it half of it is
just bright and reflective and really intricate
carving and various tiers along the towers He
goes That theres the Archive Thats what
youre looking for So just look at that tower and
keep going
 No worries
 TriSpires
 No worries He runs back and quickly gets
beneath there are now two people waiting for him
to get back and he gets back to pouring drinks
and getting food orders situated
 As you guys are making your way through the
East Outersteads towards the Pentamarket you said
youre going to the blacksmith
 Yeah it did
 As youre making your way there one thing
that you do you hear a voice thats loudly
talking that crosses you guys as youre walking
down the street You can see a younger man in his
early s or so he has really thin blondish
hair and hes wearing a tabard that is the same
colors as the Crownsguard but other than that
normal clothing
 A tabard is a piece of cloth that goes over
the front and back
 Hes shouting out you get very quick
Zadash you can see this is probably how a lot of
news is disseminated amongst the populace here
 What you hear approaching is  
a crownsguard and the Kings grace Attack on
Alfield is ended Terrible fiends responsible put
to the sword by a crownsguard and the Kings grace
 The attack on Alf He repeats it as he
continues down the street
 Okay Hes moved onto it looks like hes
cycling through different pieces of news and as
you approach hes shouting Families missing in
Nogvurot Crick kidnappers steal them away in the
night Lock and seal your windows and doors while
you slumber The attack on Alfield has ended
Terrible and you approach him at that point
 Yeah
 From my boss
 Its the Kings Hall
 I was not aware I did not know
 Thats really interesting
 That sounds amazing You should go tell
that to the Herald of the Hall Hes probably the
one who would care the most
  The attack on Alfield and he
quickly gets away from you repeating the process
over and over again
 You trying to drag her along
 Do you let him drag you
 Thats interesting
 As you say that across the way you can see
theres one crotchetylooking dude with one eye
whos like
 Averts his gaze and keeps on walking
 Following Jester you make your way back to
the Pentamarket to the outside of the Spark
Hammer Smithing What was previously closed the
night before you can now see the open air smithy
is lively and banging You can hear the slamming
of hammer on metal and the shower of sparks from
the exterior anvil setup Currently out there is a
halfling man with deeply tanned red skin short
black hair and very muscular arms who currently
has leather gloves on leather apron and is in
the process of forging some kind of long metal
blade hammering it out over a heavy anvil on the
outside There is the trough for the quenching of
the blade and then in the interior you can see a
few steps away the orange glow of the rest of the
blacksmith interior There looks to be somebody
else on the inside but you dont get a view of
them right now You can just barely get rows and
rows and racks of various pieces of armor and
weapons that are currently hanging on display on
the inside There is nobody in the process of
walking through at the moment just in the process
of crafting so you are the only individuals who
are holding the space at the moment So the metal
clanging turn 
 Metal clanging Hello
 Well Im all certainly here for that What
you got What you looking to buy
 He sets the hammer into the water the steam
rises up quenches the blade takes the gloves off
and wipes heavy sweat from the brow Youre
looking for a
 That I can do Turns around to the inside
of the building and comes back He has two hand
axes both look pretty well made one looks a
little more intricate than the other but both are
pretty solid So we got these two Throws one
and catches it throws the other and catches it
 You place them all down and looking at the
quality and the shininess and the smooth fresh
weaponry that hes placed on the table and the
pockmarked used damaged in some cases gnoll
mess covered weaponry you immediately realize
oh
 I say so these have all seen some use Not
all that great Sorry
 You couldnt fit the manacles in the bag
The one that was around the neck of the manticore
 Yeah you had them in the cart So you bring
them along with you
 Well these here these are some nice
metal
 They were magic
 Let me have a look at that He takes them
pulls on the chains drags for a minute and he
inspects them over This some real nice
craftsmanship you dont see something this well
made So where did you get this
 Did you guys bring the cart with you
 He glances past you Well the manticore
head is still affixed to the cart by the way The
halfling looks past and he goes Ill take it you
mean that thing Its quite scary well done Ah
looking at all the weapons The woods mostly
rotted unfortunately Some of the metal can be
melted down and reused have to hammer out all of
the imperfections smelt it all The manacles look
very nice Tell you what Give me the lot and the
manacles Ill give you both these axes and be in
excess of about  gold pieces
 Put that at about  gold then and the one
axe
 Sorry about that Yannick Yannick Dumel
 Nice to meet you as well Jester Inside
there is Jan She helps run the place Fantastic
Ill go get your gold for you
 I do not work in smaller bits of metal
unfortunately More the hefty kind My apologies
If youre looking for flasks Takes a moment and
thinks of something Theres Wares  Ends
Theyve probably got something there for you
Theres Packwearers Provisions they probably got
flasks around there Well they probably have some
at the Lodge of the Eclipse thats possible
 Right right Thats the more hoitytoity
night time tavern here in the Pentamarket
 Because at nighttime they has the great
shows on stage
 I dont know about a taxidermist
unfortunately Im pretty sure if you ask around
you can find someone willing to pay for that I
probably ask the Hall of Erudition they deal in
weird things and strange beasties Sorry about
that
 Lodge of the Eclipse
 All right You guys head on towards where
now
 Pentamarket
 No the library is the Archive youre
talking about Its in the western side of the Pentamarket
 No its not one of the tallest towers in
the city In fact the TriSpires as its called
has three massive towers of all different designs
that lord over the rest of the city Theyre the
first things you saw when you crested the hill on
the way into the city the night before This one
is still visible from your perspective though
Its a little more squat and maybe four or five
stories tall
 Well you can see where the Archive is but
its maybe another ten minute walk to get there
 The Kings Hall is actually not that far
from the Archive It would be a brief detour to
get there
 All right so where are you heading first
 The Archive okay On the way another town
crier crosses by another individual same garb a
middle aged woman hair pulled back into a very
tight bun with the tufts of curled hair around the
edges Same tabard in the front and shes shouting
out Riot in Rexxentrum squashed for peace
Radical groups brought to justice under the
crown
 In the middle of her next line Two weeks
to
 Two weeks time to the Harvest Close
Festival Victory Pit in the Pentamarket entry
begins in four days
 Harvest Close Festival
 Harvest Close Its the end of the harvest
 In two weeks
 In the Victory Pit in the Pentamarket Entry
begins in four days
 You eventually find your way to the outside
of the Archive Where you had seen was the
tapering tower that had the dome with the
polished sun reflection on one side the rest of
it you can see with the intricate carvings that
happen with each bit of the spiral as it continues
downward You can see three specific smaller
spires that from this perspective make it look
like I would say almost like a TIE fighter on
its side It has a series of smaller three spires
at the base and a central spire that is the
mainstay of the library You can see theres a
double door at the base and a number of
individuals dressed in deep grey robes with blue
sashes very gray and blue color scheme As you
approach the outside of it you can see folks
entering in and out but as they enter and exit the
facility they usually enter and exit under the
watch and being escorted by one of these
individuals that seem to be members of the Archive
 Its built off of one of the main roads that
leads in the direction of where the Kings Hall
is So its not in a major square area but its
off a large road
 All the windows that exist are at least
eight feet off the floor and look to be a very
thick stained glass The only entrances you see
are currently guarded by at least two members of
the Archive and the dress of them actually is very
close to the individual that helped in the trial
that you had in Trostenwald who introduced himself
as Zeenoth the one who helped provide information
that eventually got you off the hook for that
trial You can now see similarities in the color
scheme of their attire and the way that its worn
Its ceremonial It looks like it comes with a
ceremonial robe Theyre all uniform to a certain
extent with some being more intricate and longer
with more jewelry and they seem to have a little
more station
 Escorted by one of these yes
 One of them you see appears to be a woman
very well dressed looks to be a high collar a
buttoned up blouse of some kind a dress that just
barely cuts off right where her ankles hit the
ground with very nice shoes Looks to be a very
well off humanoid woman a human
 She looks stoic Leaves with a very

 Leaving
 Okay The other one looks to be a man
probably in his late s or so also human He has
a cluster of small pieces of parchment that are
folded and wadded into his arm and hes leaving
like he just was either taking something out or
just retrieving something
 Less fancy than her but still more well off
than most of the other individuals that have
passed through
 Oh yeah
 While thats happening you are following
this woman down
 Make a stealth check
 Okay No one immediately seems to pay mind
and shes currently eyes on the prize heading in
some direction with earnest intent The escort of
course that had helped her out of the Archive
stays behind and reenters the building and she
continues on her own but stays mainly on the main
streets doesnt go and duck into any alleyways
very much for her own personal safety during the
day and staying out in the open
 There do appear to be two small pockets in
the front waist part of the blouse and a small
satchel thats hanging off the right over the
left shoulder off the right side of the body
 Make a perception check
 You have no idea You come back and Notts
gone
 No Not at this point
 While the rest of you are regathering
yourselves together to continue onto the next
length of your journey Nott
 Its up to you
 The front pocket
 Yeah the front of the blouse
 Yeah
 Go ahead and roll sleight of hand please
 Okay
 As youre walking and youre concentrating
you watch as the satchel itself lifts and tugs and
just tugs Her head spins around and looks behind
her looks back
 Glances around confused eyes one of the
small pauper children thats off to the side
begging on the side of the road
 Scoffs and holds her chin up and then
continues walking with a brisker pace
 Make another stealth check please
 Okay brisker pace but does not seemed to
take notice of your tracking
 Okay
 Theres a brief moment where youve watched
the flap of the blouse open up and expand a bit as
the Mage Hand begins to reach in for what is
within and then with a slight tug you watch as two
of the blouse buttons bounce off and just a bit of
the brassiere shows and she closes her shirt real
fast and looks about again and turns and what you
can see is a man there whos selling apples on a
small cart on the side is maybe two feet from her
and goes Miss With the apple and she smacks him
right in the face and he What was what How
dare you
 Then holding her shirt closed and bundles up
her satchel up in her arms and is now beelining it
deeper into the city
 Theyre nice buttons
 If you want to insight check her youve got
to make a deception check
 Make a perception check
 Unfortunately no the Platinum House nor the
Hearth of the Allhammer were noticed The Hearth
of the Allhammer is in the Pentamarket on the
northern side and you guys had cut through to get
directly to the vicinity of the bathhouse In the
area you are now in the city you dont have any
sort of visual on the Platinum House As you guys
have gathered yourselves together and you make
your way towards The Steams Respite were going
to take a break Because it is nine oclock
 Well be back here in a few minutes well
make this as quick of a break as we can so we can
jump back in In the meantime guys sit tight
well see you again in a few minutes

 Welcome back everyone Welcome back Thank
you for your patience Once again you didnt miss
anything Sorry we didnt have a giveaway this
week We hope to have one up and going real soon
from our folks at Wyrmwood In the meantime hang
tight you didnt miss anything
 Anyway welcome back guys Great to have
you You guys coast alongside the road leading
towards the Steams Respite You catch a glance at
the Kings Hall You see a massive structure of
bronze and cobalt that is essentially the
central courthouse of the city You can see its
this massive tall single story that stands at
least  feet high with long thin windows about
every  or so feet The crownsguard presence is
pretty thick You see probably at first glance
at least ten or so that are watching the front as
general sentries There it is You do also at a
quick glance see a tenfoot by fivefoot large
heavy piece of wooden board that is standing on
its own about four feet from the main entrance to
the right It has a number of pieces of parchment
stuck to it Are you guys continuing on Head to
the bath house What are you doing
 Looks like theres one person scanning past
in the process of reading and looking at things as
they go Looks to be a person in basic leather
armors Probably a sellsword of some kind
 Not directly reading it but there are
right now four that are within a foot
proximity of it
 Well the boards right at the front what is
essentially the courthouse center of the entire city
 There is away from the building but theres
nothing
 Just a shorter version
 The height difference you can create with
Disguise Self I believe is it a foot
 Yeah so you have
 Youre a fourfoot tall Fjord
 A perfect replica of Fjord on a smaller
scale emerges from the shadows and sidles up
alongside you Fjord
 As you approach the board which you can see
has atop of it pressed into the wood the lettering
that say Task Board The heavy wooden board looks
like in immediate view of it there are maybe
eight pieces of paper that are currently stapled
to it with various rusted nails that have been
reused and they have been placed onto it or have
been stuck in and then replaced into it Theres
probably close to  or  other rusted nails that
are stuck there and have been left that have
currently holding nothing to it You do see
through a first glance both of you as you look
past them a lot of them are looking for general
work helping construction some are looking for
people that want to help reinforce buildings that
are crumbling there are some that are looking for
folks that can help shoo away parts of the
Outersteads that are encroaching upon the
farmlands on the outside of the wall You do see
one that says Seeking and paying for any
information on Myriad activity in the city
 There is one that says Reward for
information on rebel gatherings and antiCrown rhetoric
 Theres one that says
 Theres another that says Proof of others
worship of heretical gods paid in gold One that
says Looking for work for the glory of our King
Bertrand Good pay and adventurous living as a
soldier of the Righteous Brand Seek Leopold
Wanstiker at the Marrow Keep
 Wanstiker Wanstiker
 Yeah go for it
 Apparently
 No one seems to notice as you quickly
scribble out and alter the visual to where it says
Wangstacker at the Marrow Keep in the Signet
Wall and then Roving beast in need of
extermination Must be trained sellsword with
experience
 There looks to be one piece of engraved
brass or bronze material on the side that says
All job inquiries to be taken to Herald of the
Hall Voloshin within
 Oh All job inquiries are to be taken to
Herald of the Hall
 Voloshin
 Yeah VOLOSHIN
 Which is strange because the spit actually
emerges from your sternum

 As you progress you eventually find
yourself to the outside of The Steams Respite
Fairly simple looking building of deeply
darkstained wood slats that are all vertical
against heavy loadbearing columns at each major
corner but its fairly sizeable for its simple exterior
 You guys walk your way into the main
chamber Theres a couple benches to the right and
left of you Theres some small planters that have
lowlight plants being kept in the area to give a
fresher scent There is a small chair and a desk
set up with a clerk an older female halforc
hunched but smiling with her hair gray thick hair
braided up on the sides and pinned in the back
with a long spike of some kind with a lower jaw
that extends with two visible tusks but a warm
smile amongst the rest of the nice flower dress
that she wears As you approach she looks up from
the desk Hello Youve come to the Respite I am
Miss Rima Are all of you here for a bath
 Would you like individual rooms
 Right so the Common Room It is less
expensive but less private For the six of you
for the Common Chamber thatll run about three
silver apiece
 That can be provided at an additional cost
my dear Thatll be an additional one silver each
for the washing and cleaning fee
 The clothes are cleaner theyre just
tattered and patched
 Four eight    silver for the lot
Thank you so much Takes the change leads you
into a back chamber where you get undressed There
is a doorway that leads open into a central common
hot spring bath that is dug out of the ground
here It has a rock perimeter to it and the steam
immediately hits you It smells of herbs and
soaps The water itself is somewhat cloudy and it
looks like theres maybe only four other people in
there obscured by the steam at the edges of the
pool As Miss Rima leaves your presence you guys
can finish disrobing and leaving your clothing
behind and enter the bathhouse
 
 As the explosion of water hits theres this
older couple in their s or so that as you
muscle in they slowly scoot away Theres this
splash and they both  and avoid
the space
 As you come up out of the water Jester and
 you hair flaps back on the back of
your neck
 Your eyes focus and you see a familiar face
in the water across from you Leaning arms
akimbo against the rock with a thick hilt of a
sword just resting apparently
 In the hot tub You see a familiar
palelooking muscular woman with darker hair
that fades to light as there is Yasha staring at
you with a curious look

 Scoot in a bit
 Explain the tattoos
 A fully clothed tiny Fjord Yeah Even when
you remove your clothing they just shed off your
body and they still visually appear on you Its a
very strange visual
  You hear this four series of
quick snapping claps and you hear Heat it up
You hear the voice of Miss Rima from within and
you watch as two side doors open These small
troops of women and men come through with these
pots of heated water and then dump them into the
bath to refresh the heat and then exit again and
then close the doors behind them
 Looks dry But leaving a trail of water
behind
 Yes Theyre both off holding each other
just going
 They immediately get up and start leaving
into the changing room exiting the chamber
 At the moment no
 The Knowing Mis

 Thats a different pantheon all together
 The Lawbearer
 It obscures it to the point where yeah
 Generally you can say Do I believe her
and then Ill tell you to make an insight check
 Yeah For basic religion you would because
youve been outside the Empire Those of you who
grew up in the Empire you would vaguely have an
idea
 You would maybe Make a religion check
 You are very aware of the Stormlord You
knew the Stormlord well Since the Menagerie Coast
largely relies on port trade it is one of the
mostworshipped gods in the Menagerie Coast for
people who travel in and out of the ports there
Overseas safe passage amongst bodies of water
contests of strength proving worth through
action Lot of very interesting elements that the
two of you would know of that following
 You guys start making your way out of the
bath gathering your clothing once more as you
head back
 Youve been in here catching up and soaking
for about a half an hour  minutes so youre
getting pretty close to losing
 You now see the towelcovered goblinoid
form of Nott her hair wet and tattered down
across the face Its long in the front the
yellow eyes peeking through
 The clean clothing is presented You guys
get dressed and your outfits are waiting for you
in the dressing room
 Its fun to watch her make her way out using
the large greatsword essentially as a walking
stick as she emerges from the tub
 You guys have regathered your materials
Youve reconvened outside the Steams Respite
Its about midday now about noonish The rest of
the day is still yours What do you wish to do
 Perfect
 Those of you heading to the Kings Hall you
make your way back to the familiar outside this
large center for law order and judgement within
the city of Zadash As you approach the doorways
the guards pass but keep an eye very closely as
you enter On the interior you can see there are
two round tables with curved benches that meet the
sides of it and there you can see some of the
crownsguard in the process of talking to various
civilians and taking notes Theres conversation
about pardon me So
 You dont see a desk or a clerk but you do
see the crownsguard that are currently at the
tables talking to these individuals and you see
two other individual crownsguards that are
standing and guarding two hallway entrances that
lead further into the Kings Hall
 Oh let me go and get the Herald for you
hold on just a second He scoots out of the next
hallway A few moments later you watch as this
really stressedlooking male dwarf with these
thick mutton chops and saltandpepper hair
wellgroomed combed really heavily to one side
the thick hair is being tamed to the point where
in a very Gene Wilder way its combed and then
 out one side As he walks in hes wearing
long robes of gold and white and silver and
carries the holy symbol of the Lawbearer You can
see an axe that hangs on a chain with a scale
embedded in the center of it He walks in Right
So youre inquiring about the job board
 All right Which one in the task board you
looking for
 He gives a quick glance over all of you
All right Let me go ahead and pull this out He
pulls a small side bag that has a bunch of pieces
of paper in it He unfurls one section sets it
down And your names
 Im sorry but for the purposes of
maintaining organization within the paperwork here
we need to know the names of those who are to
claim any rewards or benefits of completing a job
 Philbin all right And you are
 Lawrence
 Kylre
 Esma all right
 Make a deception check
 Okay
 All right Barry Okay 
This here is a writ of Lawmaster intent This will
give you entrance to the location of where the job
is supposed to take place This supposed creature
has holed up in a sewer nexus right on where the
Interstead Sprawl meets with the outer wall of the
TriSpires We need you to travel down there and
well lets say theres a whole region on the
inside where weve been hearing about this backing
up of various liquid and strange noises from
cleaners who were making their way through so we
sent a few crownsguards down and came across a
mass of congealed sewage slime and webbing so the
fucking cowards ran back and we need to dig
creating this disturbance kill it take it back
with proof of the kill whatever built that little
nest and the Crown is willing to drop you about
 gold pieces
 Thats correct
 Well you have to divide it evenly from the
 you get
 All the ones that are named on here
 Theres more involved
  Takes the writ And who are the
other companions
 Karen and Rothschild
 No that would be  gold split between
the lot of you
 Whatevers causing the blockage and the
webbing whatever else they found down there Yes
take care of that bring back proof of the
death
 No fucking clue thats why youre being
paid  gold for it
 People have gone missing You think youre
the first to try and take the job No its
dangerous Thats why were paying so much If you
dont want it go away If you want it heres the
writ good luck
 There have been three times that its been
taken up and ones come back declining it and two
that have not
 Think they changed their mind a bit
 Im sure you will
 Its a dwarven thing Weve got resting
bitch voice

 Great Well shove off
 All right
 After asking some questions and making your
way around you eventually find the TriSpires
which is not too difficult to see once you know
what youre looking for You see these three very
uniquelooking towers that ascend past a round
wall that encases the interior of this elite
portion of the city As you approach the wall
the outer walls you see are basic stonework and
masonry thick as they may be and used as from a
defensive position these walls are made of solid
marble and look more decorative than designed to
be a military buttress of any kind As you
approach you can see there are two entrances to
it or at least youve been told there are two
The one thats nearest to you opens in the
direction of the Pentamarket and while the
portcullis is lifted you see there are two
crownsguard there currently standing with spears
and shields at the ready A horsedrawn carriage
clomps by you and makes its way inside You guys
approach and one of the guards steps forward Can
I help you please
 I dont think you do Please shove off
 Whats your business with the Pillow
Trove
 Look your friend here looks like he just
wandered out of the Evening Nip if anything so it
would be best
 They look at each other Make a persuasion
check

 Look at each other look back at you All
right Ill walk you in Briefly Then Ill get
back to my post You stay the fuck out of this
 All right to the Pillow Trove This way
follow me The other guard steps past him and
blocks you from the other two As the guard guides
you in he makes a big whistle sound does a finger
loop and you watch as another guard gets relieved
and comes down to help him at the front doorway
 Thank you I appreciate that Now
stepping into the TriSpires
 Theres maybe a  second period where hes
making his way down You get the sense from the
look of this and glancing through the interior
you see elements of beautiful courtyard parks with
trees and bushes You can see statuesque
structures that decorate what normally was just
dirt road with occasional bits of stonework as
beautifully laid cobblestone from the interior
you can see homesteads of different styles of
construction from all across this continent and
beyond This is where the money in the city goes
This is the district where the elite live where
the elite work and where folk of very specific
visual presentation and purpose are allowed entry
 Roll a stealth check for Frumpkin
 As Frumpkin begins to  run on its
way and one of the guards goes Piss off and
kicks Frumpkin about ten feet off and stumbles
and skids and then gets back up
 Id say take one point of damage
 I didnt
 Stray cats cant just wander into
 The guard looks a bit confused As you
wander back hes pointing at the tip of his boot
and hes like I dont know it was fucking
crazy So what do you look like
 The Pillow Trove
 They both blink their eyes at you As you
glance down to look at your hand its your
regular sleeve
 It worked but then as you approached you
looked down and its no longer there

 You have a sense now you think back to the
air of magical longevity the spell would maintain
its gone
 At some point as you approached and then
walked up to the gate your Disguise Self just
dissipated The one guard that was there before is
like
 As you walk away he just goes Yeah
thats what I thought
 Quick meeting right Quick fucking
meeting
 You are escorted to the exterior of the
Pillow Trove which would be over here in the TriSpires
 Youre led down the beautiful cobblestone
street Around the bend of this beautiful
courtyard where you can see a family that is
currently sitting down and having an openair
picnic here amongst the grass Butterflies in the
air its picturesque to the point where you
question how engineered it is to a certain degree
With a couple of quick spins you see one that
catches your eye which is really interesting
this massive one of the TriSpire towers thats
closest to the vicinity of The Pillow Trove looks
like it was this old temple thats been completely
hollowed out and repurposed to look like a glitzy
casino There are banners that are pulled across
in brightlycolored silks that mingle and braid
into each other You can see on each different
floor theres a different tone to the stone thats
been slightly altered and you can see signs
showing different forms of entertainment Its
simultaneously historically aweinspiring and
gaudy combination that is intriguing
 Kind of yeah Its a little Vegasy
compared to the rest of this area You can see a
lot of the
 At the corners of these roads you can see
these tall lanterns that contain a very faintly
everburning flame Between each of them theres
a long white silken banner that hangs as part of
decoration along each road The roads themselves
feel like theyre always in some loose paradetype
celebration thats just part of the decor of the
vicinity The stark contrast between the
Outersteads to even the moderately average
Innersteads to the TriSpires is astronomical
 Have you not been here before
 Interesting Youre in the Silken Terrace
What youre looking at right there is called the
Triumph Chime Its got all sorts of bars
gambling halls inn rooms brothel everything you
need up here
 Weve got them in places What you think
were uncivilized folk Where are you from
 Huh Well youll feel right at home
yeah
 Well here you are Pillow Trove As he
motions over to the side you see this luxurious
inn that has this cylindrical appearance to the
front and then turns into a blocky building
behind It has this gold and deep purple
coloration to the pillars that hold up the various
walls to each intersection and as soon as you
walk inside the scents of scented candles and
various lavendertype smells hit your nose The
element of it reminds you of home As you walk
inside theres a beautiful semicircle desk and
a human woman probably in her mids or so jet
black hair thats straight and dangles past her
shoulders watches you approach as the guard
says Ill wait here and escort you out when
youre done
 Very well What is the name receiving
 I shall inquire Ill be back here in just
a moment
 As she leaves from the front desk you can
see there are two crownsguard that are assigned to
the sides that are keeping a close watch on you
but theyre lackadaisy through their day You
get the sense they probably dont have to work too
hard this side of the city About five minutes pass
 Theyre both watching you but not intently
like hawks more just making sure youre not doing
anything silly You watch as a rather bounding
obese merchant in his late s or so comes
barreling down the stairway sniffling hard and
rubbing his nose Hes dressed really well maybe
a size too small trying to reclaim a presentation
maybe of a younger self and he hasnt quite come
to terms with the fact that hes hitting that age
As he walks past he goes Ah Good day
 He exits the building Another five minutes
pass and eventually the woman comes back and she
goes Im sorry we dont have a package for that
name here Is there any other it might be under
 Ill check
 She leaves again for another few minutes
Comes back after that Im sorry theres nothing
under that name
 Ill check one more time
 She leaves
 She comes back out Im terribly sorry we
do not have a package for or under any of those names
 Which one
 Oh All right okay
 Very well Ill make a note of it
 If you like we could set you up with a
room
 Well depends on the size We have our
general suites we have the lordly suites and
then we have the diplomatic invitational suites
Pricing begins at ten gold per room for the basic
suites  for the next tier up and for the
diplomatic ones those run about  gold a night
 Of course Ten gold per night how long do
you plan to stay
 All right That was Jester right
 Very well all right
 Thank you and here is the key to your
room
 Second floor third door on the left it
should be number 
 So sorry I couldnt be of help with you
 Okay
 You get into your room The door opens its
a beautiful small room but well decorated and a
nice queensize canopy bed and a dresser with a
mirror a chair a little
 You turn and in the hallway to where you
entered you see a familiar cloak of deep green hooded
 The cloak nods down towards you and the
voice slowly cascades out from underneath Im so
sorry shes not aware that youre here now but
youre with friends
 Child I think I help you quite a bit
already
 What do you need
 He leans forward and the hand reaches out
and takes your chin a little bit and holds it
there There in the dark space of the hood you
can see the familiar verdant irises looking back
and the warmth fills you once more the comfort
that kept you comfortable so many years alone in
that room I think the more deeds you do the
more lives you change the more confident brats
you break Shell find you
 The hand pulls back and takes the pamphlet
Hmm Adorable
 You know what to do then
 Im never far
 As you look down at the pamphlet and look up
to say that hes gone You hear this faint little

 Um all right
 Youre welcome
 Reeve
 He had his hand out looks like hes
expecting some sort of a tip
 Oh okay
 Hes not an interior guard Based on his
markings it looks like hes supposed to be at the perimeter
 Oh I misunderstood
 Hes not coming in
 Im sorry we have to maintain a certain
kind of presentation here
 Yeah in this time you could have made your
way around
 Yeah
 Piss off
 You watch as his face His eyes go wide for
a second and he goes Youre a fan of the
Chastity Nook
 You hear that
 No
 I appreciate what youre trying to do pay
off a Crownsguard of the city of Zadash to let
you a lowlife from the skids of the town in the
most expensive and most wellguarded region of the
city I like my job I like my head
 Jester
 Okay You guys meet up on the outside of the
district
 As you guys jaunt off to catch up with the
rest of the troop meeting probably because you
guys would probably be heading back to The Leaky
Tap You manage to gather in the center of the
common area You see a freshlymuddied Caleb enter
with a somewhat flustered but smiling Jester
 By now Id say its probably closer to
three in the afternoon
 Taking a little bit of liquid courage as you
muster your weaponry and gather your way to the
direction to the entry of the sewer where the
currently acquired mercenary contract had been taken
 And thats where well pick up next week

 Sorry man
 Please continue to try Not every means to
an end is the easiest and most straightforward man
 I want this to be an Oceans Elevenstyle
like three episode miniarc to get into the smut
shop thats what I want

 Thank you guys so much for watching Those
Ill see in Kentucky Ill see you soon Oh boy
 Be back next week with Ashley
 Excited to have you home for a little
longer
 I missed you There was something else I was
supposed to talk about
 No I already commented on the giveaway
What was it
 Whered Lockey go He was supposed to remind
me of something
 Anyway Ill put it on Twitter if I remember
what it was Anyway love you guys take care of
yourselves well see you next week and is it
Thursday yet Good night
 We had a bathhouse episode

 Its all good So last we left off the
Mighty Nein have been making their rounds in the
city of Zadash seeking opportunities
information getting their bearings amongst the
various townsfolk streets and what goingson
there are Getting updates from town criers
wandering through the roads speaking with
individuals going into bathhouses where you met
up with your fantastic longlost barbarian Yasha
coming in to join alongside you guys in your
exploits You managed to converse with a meeting
or at least Beau and Fjord met with a meeting of
unhappy denizens of the Empire discussing their
frustrations beneath the Leaky Tap and had
crossed some information with them You had gone
and made some purchases You had sold off
a few of the things you had acquired in your journeys
northward along the Amber Road You had decided
to looking for work go to the Kings Hall where
they had a task board there and had taken one of
the contracts that had been posted You would be
paid to seek the sewers beneath the city near the
outskirts of the TriSpire area of the town for
something that had been lurking within those
tunnels below A couple of guards had not
returned one had gone there and fled You were
promised a sum of money should you be able to
exterminate whatever this entity is and bring back
proof of its demise You jauntily accepted this
Before this happened as a part of a journey
towards this TriSpire both Caleb and Jester made
their way there Caleb unsuccessfully entering a
nicer district of the city that did not seem to
believe or respect his presentation Jester did
so She got a room at one of the hoitytoity inns
in the district and was led to some mild
disappointments Where we left off the two of you
had reconvened and begun making your way back to
meet up with the rest of your friends at the Leaky
Tap tavern Probably at a brief distance from each
other as Caleb has huffed off in a bit of
frustration Eventually Caleb you make your way
to the familiar outside of the Leaky Tap You
enter the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh
and dried against your face into the interior At
this point its midafternoon theres maybe
about lets say nine patrons in there and a
number of your friends who have been waiting for
the two of you to return that are all sitting around a
table and discussing amongst themselves The rest
of you guys look across and watch Caleb enter
and then a few moments after Jester enters as well
 Make a perception check
 
 You look around the room and nothing seems
to apparate The clientele all seem disinterested
with your presence Theres nothing that would
belie any arrival of an entity she spoke of
 You do From Port Damali to the southern
gates of the Empire and the Wuyun Gorge on foot
which you guys were traveling on foot it took you
about the better part of two weeks You passed
through Nicodranas or you didnt pass through
Nicodranas but you went through along the road and
skirted along the side You took the road pretty
much straight there but it was quite a bit of
travel on foot to get there
 No I believe it was Trostenwald
 Its a very intricate key It feels like a
dense iron but its been gold leafed or coated
in some sort of reflective goldlike metal Its
very well made It has little scrawlings on it
almost like a spiral in the center The key
itself
 is probably worth a silver in its own
right
 Okay Good to know
 You turn back at the threepiece halfelven
band that are moseying their way through the
afternoon lazily Theyre whispering and chatting
amongst each other and ribbing each other with
their elbows between things halfpaying attention
to the music but its nice enough to keep atmosphere
 As the coin clinks and rolls about two feet
off the gentleman standing with this double set
of drums that lays over a leather strap on him
you can see hes got the shaved sides of his
head this young halfelven boy immediately sees
that stops drumming grabs the coin gives you a
nod and goes right back into the song You watch
as the other performers all of a sudden
immediately look to you and theyre all like
 So hes Steve Martin in The Jerk yeah

 Later afternoon
 Which guy
 Yeah you dont know anything You can go
back and try and ask for information on that but
you havent met him or know anything
 From where you are now itd take you maybe
the better part of  minutes better part of an hour
 Its late afternoon Youre probably about
an hour and a half two hours from sundown
 Do keep in mind and this is my fault too
for not keeping track of it but even with
darkvision youre still seeing pretty low light
Longdistance perception checks without light
youre still at disadvantage on them Ive been
bad about keeping track of that
 So you can turn things into torches
  Everyone looks at their equipment
suddenly
 Well all righty Whats the plan
 You do You have a handaxe
 Are you guys making your way towards that
direction
 Okay fair enough Make an investigation
check for you as you guys travel and traverse the city
 Yeah along the way and keeping an eye out
asking a couple questions here and there you
eventually find a very basic clothingwears
company Nothing fancy but just utility Pants
workers shirts gloves and cloaks are available
So if you want to buy a cloak you can do that
 Not in this one no Your choices are pretty
much brown black and gray so youre good
 Youre good on that one I do not recall if
they had any pricing put down for cloaks
  gold pieces please Eh it falls under what
would be general common clothes so Ill put the
cloak cost at two silver
 Exactly
 The further north you go yeah This
particular area is pretty chilly especially since
youre getting towards the end of fall Its
almost Harvest Close in two weeks You guys are
hitting winter in the very near future
You would know this too that snowfall is fairly
common throughout the winter here
 For both of those together One silver piece
 Perfect Following that the task board
contract that you recovered and was assigned to
you by the Herald of the Hall contains both the
Writ of Lawmaster Intent which is what will give
you approval to travel into the sewer without
being harried by the Crownsguard and also gives
you the location of the sewer that leads you
there Following the basic instructions and asking
around you eventually find yourselves at the
corner of Ruen Road and Dewmist
 Yeah RUEN As you approach this
intersection largely still cobblestone a few
that are missing and the dust has sift
pockets to make it soft The sky is still light
but you can see the sun just beginning to crest past
the near walls and familiar to the two of you you
guys are maybe two blocks away from the outer wall of
the TriSpires
 At the intersection there are two
crownsguard that are stationed there that are
keeping eyes and watching around Off to the
eastern side of that intersection behind one of the
poles that contain the lanterns that are lit at
night you can see the cover that leads into the
sewer below Its less of a sewer or manhole
cover but theres an open drain and a latch and a
small metal pole that prevents anyone from going
into it
 Make a perception check
 You dont see anything dangerous
Georgie
 As you begin to spend time staring through
the grate and start deciding how to get into
there one of the Crownsguard stationed walks up
and approaches quickly and goes Excuse me can I
ask you what youre doing here
 Ive heard a few things Its a
 Apparently theres something down there
thats been real scary and
 Im not fucking going down there You
kidding me
 I only know what Ive heard
 No I can open the grate
 I wasnt meaning to put words in
 He scratches his head over his helmet and
doesnt realize hes not getting to the itch
 All I know is that apparently they lost a
couple of guys down there and
 One of them was pissing himself and ran
 Well be my guest He pulls a key off of a
ring and goes down to the latch on the metal bar
that blocks off the entry and pulls it open
 I dont fucking know Theres a lot of
them around here
 They never recovered the body
 Well youre welcome to go down there and
continue
 Yes to prevent folks from wandering into
them
 Well Im stationed here for the next
several hours so as long as you return
 To this one Youll be fine
 Well start shouting Keep that writ on hand
and if theres any crownsguard that hear you
theyll probably be able to let you out
 Im going to be honest I havent been down
there It smells real bad
 I dont think so We havent had any heavy
rainfall I havent been able to hear more than a
trickle down there for a number of weeks
 Nothing Ive heard no
 I understand Theres seven of you
 He looks genuinely overwhelmed by all the
information and goes Good luck and yell if you
need something  He pulls the
rest of the bar open and you guys have this space
about a foot and a half
 Yasha as you climb down immediately it drops 
and your foot finds a rung Theres a metallic bar that
acts as a ladder As you begin to lower yourself
down you can look to your left and right and
what little bit of daylight is coming through
helps fill out some of the interior You can
see what looks to be maybe  or so feet across from 
side to side  to  feet from this wall to the other
slick stones a slight curvature that leads
into a base where there is a small ditch or a
basin where old liquid is trickling through There
is a mild decline heading away from the direction
you are and a mild incline heading in the
direction of the TriSpires The smell is not
pleasant but youre a tough chick its never
been an issue So you get yourself down and its
no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this
at the moment You see from this spot where youve
climbed down the ceiling drops low to about
ten or so feet Youre probably about  or 
feet below the surface now
 Your torch lights and the bright space
begins to open up from side to side
 Make a perception check
 Spoke too soon
 Yeah you dont have to
 You all eventually down into the sewer
grate and then you hear the   and
the metal bar up top is closed
 Make an investigation check
 Looking at right near the base of where the
rungs are it looks like there are arrows that point each
direction The arrow to the right which leads
upward splits into three additional arrows
 Its just a continuous arrow
 Shh Dont spoil it You guys begin to head
southward Its a very faint decline You can
only tell its a decline in the sense that if you
look right or left you can see the water is
trickling in the direction youre traveling The
tunnel continues for about  feet or so before it
curves slightly to the right and then comes to another
set of rungs and another sewertop access
 Yes that was the only notable element of
what you were looking for
 Perception check
 No sense of webbing no
 At the moment you dont see anything moving
no
 Make an investigation check if you want to
 You get down and look about and you dont
see any tracks by any means but you notice that
near where the water is and its a faint trickle
of water The stream is about that wide and you
barely hear it moving past You see elements of
sludge that has slowly congealed over time along
the edges of this groove that guides the liquid
and you can see bits are pushed like something had
moved through in the direction of where you were
but thats it
 Angled like something slid and pushed
through the water in the direction you came from
 About four inches
 Yeah You see one or two that slide out
 Make an intelligence check
 Its a combination of things Your
alchemical history and heightened goblin senses
for waste product Theres hints of excrement
 No No No
No All right Um
 Stop it Sam Okay
 Theres a hint of an iron aftertaste
something oxidizing somewhere in the water or the
water itself A faint hint of sulphur from the
water and things breaking down in the water
Nothing that catches your immediate attention
except for  Oh my God shes no longer
roleplaying
 Because you rolled so high that faint iron
aftertaste is familiar
 It reminds you of when youve licked a wound
or bit your lip Its very faint Because you
rolled that high youre like hmm
 So what are you guys doing
 Correct Or continues on the direction you
were traveling Looking at that set of rungs you
can see the arrows that are still marked there
Theres a singular arrow that goes in the
direction where you came from and the other arrow
splits into two You get the sense that each of
these indicates where the next if you continue
that way if its going to divide or be straight
Part of this network of sewers that have been
built below Zadash long ago
 You were heading down and the waters
trickling in that direction
 You guys continue back to where you were and
traverse instead upwards You guys had paid a
little bit of attention when you were traveling
towards the TriSpire but the entire city is not
level There are grades to it It was built over
hilly terrain as most of this valley itself has
all sorts of varying heights of hills and clusters
of hills The TriSpire is up on a raised hill
within the citys construct so as you ascend in
the direction of the TriSpire you get the sense
that youre not ascending too terribly much but
youre now just about underneath where the wall
was As it curves around a bit you look ahead as
Yashas holding out her torch and you can see a
Tintersection of the sewer where it continues on
straight or heads to the right or to the left
 You also see more of those clusters of
builtup refuse that have created small masses in
the ground where the water is pooling and making
its way around
 Yeah
 You can yeah And while the floor itself
the walls gradually come in and become a bit of a
level platform and then descend into the ditch
where the water is traversing the ceiling is a
continued curvature of it Its almost like a
tube
 Make a perception check
 You make an investigation check
 You see a very faint barely shifting piece
of thin silk cheese clothlike material that is
barely visible on the cusp of the torchlight on
the righthand side of that intersection
 As we continue from this point guys I want
to know what your marching order is as youre
traversing forward
 Right We have Caleb at the back
 Nott youre in the middle with them
 Jester where are you
 There we go So you go up and inspect the
web
 You guys head up with the torch You come
into the intersection The water is coming down
from the path in front of you directly across
The lefthand tunnel continues for about  or 
feet before it curves off and goes upward again
almost a parallel path Theres water trickling
down there thats all meeting here To the right
where this webbing is there is no water It is a
dry ditch
 Sure You bring the torch to the webbing and
watch as it burns away in a few seconds and turns
to ash and dust Theres also a very faint
scratching sound
 You activate one of them As it lights up
you bring the torch around to look
 As the armor filters up onto you the weird
warm humid air of the sewer interior seems to
crystallize against your armor The ice that
normally gives a translucent bluishwhite color
has a strangely yellowgreen tint to it
 Okay You take a quick swig You guys look
out in the distant tunnels and you see nothing
 Its funny As you glance down at the
ground though one of those small clusters of
refuse shifts a little bit And shifts again
 I say little Its a few feet across
Theyve gotten larger as youve progressed on
 Theres a bunch up in the hall around you
right now As you throw the ball bearing and it
hits some of it breaks away and you see horrible
matted fur Theres a flash in the torchlight
where you see two eyes reflect through and you
hear this sound  You watch as fangs open
up and a bunch of the other clusters of gathered
refuse all suddenly begin to shift and skitter in
your direction I need you all to roll
initiative
 We had you guys up here
 All righty
 All of these sewerfaring giant rats begin
to rush towards you Their fur seems to have over
time merged with other bits of discarded debris
and matter causing this outer shell of broken
garbage trash and excrement that protects them
and gives this look of a horrible halfburned
pile of compost with teeth and fur rushing in your
direction On that note
 For initiative here guys lets start with
 to  Anyone
 Oh damn
 You rolled a natural  Whats your
initiative
 Oh thats right We have Nott and Fjord 
to 
  to 
  to five
 Molly what was yours
 All righty
 Its fine It doesnt matter in the order
At the top all of them start rushing in their
eyes glaring as they shift past the torch that
Yashas holding Theres probably six maybe seven
in the vicinity at a quick glance around you and
theyre all rushing in your direction Nott and
Fjord you guys are up first
 At the moment you dont see any
 You can
 That rat there gets an attack of opportunity
as you swipe out of its range first That is going
to be a  actually not bad
 That hits
 As it snaps out at you you take
five points of piercing damage As it bites out
you feel its teeth sink into the back of your calf
muscle through the armor and into the back of the
thick running muscle The pain strikes through
you You yank your foot away and you feel
something tear You can feel the blood running
down the back of your leg and inside your boot as
you feel the pounding of the very dirty bite that
its left in the back of your leg
 As you pull away from it the pounding pain
of your leg is also accompanied by the sudden
sound of a rat shattering into ice pieces against
the ground and disintegrating As it bites and
sinks its teeth into you the thing suddenly
crusts over with a similar type of strange
yellowishgreen ice before it T shatters
across the floor of the inside of the sewer
Continuing your round
 In one sweep an empty hand apparates and
water springs out from the grasp as it slams down
Go ahead and roll for an attack
 A  hits You can roll damage
 As you sweep down you completely bisect the
rat with your blade It screams out in this loud
heavy horrible monstrous squeak Youre not used
to hearing what normally is a small rodent sound
but amplified from a larger bulbous mutated form
that it now has As you impact you see it cut in
half It releases this putrid cloud of whatever
gases its body holds in it I need you to make a
constitution saving throw please
 You manage to hold your breath and back out
of it as it dissipates around you That finishes
your turn
 Correct Theres one right there Each one
of these is considered one spot between you
 Right there Okay go for it Roll for
attack
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 It rears back and goes to leap in the air
towards Mollys face It gets maybe two inches off
the ground before your bolt sinks right through
its skull emerges on the other side and it spins
in the air The momentum of its leap striking the
momentum of your bolt and theres a spray of
blood in the air This noxious cloud of gas
emerges from the wound thats left in the side of
its throat I need Molly Beau and Yasha to make
constitution saving throws please
 Its like popping a balloon It 
They seem based on the bacteria and whatever
theyve been living in to be carrying a large
amount of this gas in their body Whatd you get
 Molly you pull away for the moment and put
your coat over the front and block it The two of
you unintentionally it gets into your nose it
stings your eyes you both take three points of
poison damage
 Finished your turn Nott
 Beau youre up As youre coughing its
stinging all of your senses and you right
yourself and prepare for your turn
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight damage Angrily in response to this
you sweep down with a giant golf swing of your
staff and as it hits it impacts bludgeons the
side of its body It gets slammed hits the wall
and falls to the ground Some of the gas seeps out
of its body but it isnt exposed It is dead but
the method of damage delivery seemingly didnt
disturb whatever was contained within its body
 Over which one
 Jesus
 You rush up and critically kick this rat in
the side of its body Wham You feel breaks and
bones or might be sticks might be whatever else
has created this shell of debris about its body
It gives this screeching sound as falls over onto
its side and then gets back in its place Its
hurting its barely holding itself in place but
its angry and ready to snap back at you
 And it is Yashas turn actually
 No those are all rats I didnt have as
many rat minis for this Use your imagination
 You get the idea
 You have enough movement to get to any of
those
 Over here One two three
 Okay go for it Make an attack roll
 Yasha the rat puncher Youre not raging
right Its just a regular attack
 That hits So it takes one point of damage
plus whatever your strength modifier is
 Yep
 Well its one point and then she adds her
strength modifier to it So four yeah So it
takes four points of damage As you bludgeon it
you hold the sword with one hand Or your swords
probably still sheathed at this point youre
holding the torch in one hand so you rush up and
fistpunch it
 Its not a light weapon its not a weapon
you can offhit with it
 You couldve if that was your action but
youve already punched it However you did
straight up rush up and coldcock deck a sewer rat
in the face Once again you feel the crunching
right behind it as it falls over and gets back up
its jaws hanging off to one side and it has this
horrible gurgling sound as it screams at you A
combination of this reddish blood and whatever
putrid green liquid is mixing and pouring out of
its mouth
 Okay that ends your turn then right All
right its now their turn This one is going to
shift around painfully limping to get down and
try to bite out towards your legs This ones
going to move still in combat with you and go
after actually no because you punched it its
going to continue after you This one is going to
come after you as well since you rushed up in its
way So the one coming after Beau That is going
to be a 
 Misses You duck out of the way The two
against you is a 
 That hits
 All right and a  Both hit So you take
from that first one six points of piercing damage
as it leaps up and actually
 Youre not raging
 Yeah thats resistance from the rage
Thats okay
 You can use a bonus action on your turn to
rage if you want to
 Its okay So you take six points of
piercing damage As it bites up and you put your
arm in the way and it clamps onto your forearm it
begins tearing You shove it off and it lands onto
the ground spins and gets back to its feet The
other one you take four points of piercing
damage As you shove that one off the other one
leaps onto your back and begins snapping at the
back of your neck and shoulders and you shove it
back onto the ground and it readies itself for
another strike as theyre slowly swarming around
you Ending their turn now Jester youre up
 Go for it This is the one thats already
been punched too so you rush up with your handaxe
and swing Go and make an attack roll
 Yeah that hits Go and roll damage
 Seven points of damage The rat thats face
is already broken even when it managed to bite
towards Yasha earlier it was mostly dragging its
top fangs across the side of her forearm as its
jaw would not actually snap shut You finish the
blow by taking the axe swiping down As you do
you carve into its body and a cloud of poison
dissipates from its torso area I need Yasha
Caleb and you Jester to make constitution
saving throws please
 Okay You manage to hold yourself off not
being taken into it a second time
 Five points of poison damage to you as you
accidentally inhale a spray of it into your face
youre like 
 Five You also take five points of poison
damage
 That end your turn Jester
 Okay so you finish coughing
 Okay then Molly youre up
 Go for it Which one are you going up to
the one that Beau kicked earlier
 Okay go for it Roll a d and add your
strength bonus
  just hits
 You deal one point of damage to that one As
you reach down and sock it in the head
 Go for it
 Well are you attacking with your
 You have two attacks with the light weapon
on the side technically Eh Ill allow it Its
fine go for it
 Okay so it takes two points of damage So
now you guys are rat punching You guys are going
through and punching the fuck out of rats
 Repeatedly decking the face
 Your knuckles are bleeding a little bit
Its not really enough to damage you but as
youre punching down youre hitting slick oiled
fur and jagged points of broken wood and whatever
else has jammed itself into its matted fur But
youve managed to hit it a couple of times and
its taken a little bit of damage but its still
like  It looks very cornered and lashing
out now That ends your turn Molly Caleb youre
up
 By Yasha go for it Roll for the attack
  hits Go and roll damage on the Fire
Bolt Its a d right
 Five Between the punches you gave it
thats enough to finish it

 As you run back you finish dry heaving and
then release the bolt of fire It rockets past
the sewer walls light up in succession down
following the streak of flame through As it
impacts theres a burst and what would have been
the gas that is released from its body
incinerates from the fire damage and does not
affect anyone surrounding it All righty
finishing Calebs turn that brings us to the top
Nott and Fjord
 There is one more over here thats limping
next to Beau
 Go for it
  hits Roll damage
 Yep
 How do you want to do this
 Okay As you turn around the side of Caleb
putting your second bolt in spinning around
firing it strikes the side of it and where you
hit it in the side theres this large pocket of
stretched rat skin where its pulled so far that
the fur itself is disparate and you can see the
peach flesh beneath the fur As it hits it
 Its a combination of force from both
the blow of the bolt and the propulsion of the
release of gas that sprays right in the direction
of Beau I need you to make another constitution
saving throw please
 Thats okay you only take one point of
poison damage I rolled really low for that one
 You take one point of poison damage
 Ill leave this here as a visual aid sure
 This is the direction you guys had come in
from so the liquid is traveling down this way
and then down this way and there is no liquid
from the side and the web that you had destroyed
is up in this corner
 Youre going to go in this direction
 In comparison to some of the scents youve
encountered in this conflict suddenly the rest of
the sewer doesnt smell as bad
 Yeah
 Okay As you push through one of the open
wounds from one of the ones that was cut through
by either Jester or Fjord Id say about a third
of the body mass is an assembled shell of refuse
The interior of it appears to be rat or
animallike General array of organs though a lot
of them have a colorless gray or beige appearance
to them and a lot of them look to be in various
stages of necrosis and theres a lot of infection
inside
 Yeah its pretty nasty
 You can go ahead and make an intelligence
check
 With advantage
 Nine
 You would know enough from the knowledge
that you have that while there is necrosis in
there it doesnt look like its fully in there
These things are
 Or at least they were alive up until a
moment ago These infections when they continued
for a period of time probably not for long
 To the right okay You do get a glance with
your torchlight Yasha as you glance up the path
across the way and the path that curves around
the side and you do see a few other similar
collections Though not moving or not reacting to
the vicinity of where you are Even glancing at
the ones who were fighting you you can see upon
closer look that their eyes are snowblind or
infected to the point where they were very
nearsighted or close to blind The patches in the
distance you can see arent reacting you your
presence
 No youre going that way
  Id like you to all roll stealth
checks please
 Ill let it happen Usually you have to give
that before they roll so you dont know
 Its fine
  is better
 Okay As you guys continue down the right
pathway you continue further and find the
clusters of makeshift bits of discarded material
begin to give way as about  feet ahead of you
the torchlight begins to refract and reflect
against some sort of soft material that is
drifting and enclosing a portion of the walkway
You see ahead of you a majority of the tunnel is
currently blocked other than a small path on the
right side of it by a dense webbing of some
kind
 You see a large knot or a not a Nott a
knot of webbing as well that is held aloft a foot
off the ground
 Make a perception check
  It does not appear to be moving
 Possibly insectoids This would not be
technically an insect
 I mean its webbing There are many
creatures in nature that use webbing in different
forms and types
 Yes theres that too Glancing at this the
mass that is encased in the webbing is about this big
 Its about dogsized
 Its about  feet ahead of you
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because it does go beyond the torch threshold
 That one does not no
 Looking past you can see layers of webbing
continue for about what you can see  feet
beyond that It looks to be an even heavier wall
of it behind that completely blocks continued
access into that chamber You can see two other
much larger clusters of webbing that are wrapped
around something
 You can get to it yeah
 Theres bits of it that are drifting below
You see that it does shift every now and then It
looks like theres some sort of a breeze coming
through faint as it is Thats why from the
webbing that is currently held aloft between the
ceiling and the floor and the left wall from your
perspective the first one you see every now and
then you see it faintly shift as if a breeze or
water moves through
 To get to this one No
 You can
 Okay is this the one with your activated
rite
 And the rite you activated was
 The Rite of the Dawn As his scimitar which
is now glowing with this faint radiant light
energy it almost burns through as you carve
through Slowly its not an easy cut but you do
carve through As you do the webbing begins to
curl back and blacken at the edges As it pulls
away you see something furry and fleshy As you
pull it back a few more inches you watch as a rat
head lolls out a tongue falling out the side It
looks to be dry it looks to be bereft of any sort
of internal liquid or life
 Well it does not appear
 Its unseen but you sense its presence
arrive
 On the dry dustcovered floor of this
interior part of the sewer where the temperature
has dropped and is a little less humid in this
area there are two small plumes of dust on the
ground and you sense the servant has arrived
 Okay you put your hand forward and its
like hitting the back of someones back but
theres nothing there and it catches you off
guard youre like What the heck It feels
somewhat amorphous like a heavy wind pushback for
a second but theres no wind and theres no
whipping of force around your arm Its very
strange
 All right Schmidt goes past

 You sense this the first webbing barricade
which has a small fivefoot space between it and
the wall to the next one the one that you saw
which encompasses the entirety of this wall There
are small onefoot wide sections of it along the
upper part of the wall where theres a gap but
most of it is pure web across There are two of
them there and are you getting close with the
torch to reveal it Otherwise its going to be
beyond the torch light its going to be very dim
and hard to see the details
 Right so the two of you approach the first
barrier to see the second As Schmidt approaches
the second barrier one of the masses which does
appear to be humanoid in size shakes slightly
doesnt react The other one shakes slightly and
you watch as an arm limply falls from the side of
it some webbing tearing as it does you hear a
metal sword clang to the ground You see a bracer
that once belonged to a crownsguard
 The bracer  and drifts on its own in
your direction
 Youre about ten feet from it
 They look pretty dead theyre ten to 
feet from you
 Yeah do you have any specific order you
want to maintain here
 All right
 All right Caleb Yasha and Beau
 Is it Molly and Fjord at the front of the
other group
 Okay so Nott goes behind Caleb and then we
have Fjord and Molly on the other side with Jester
behind them
 Okay You move around that barrier and get
to the next ten to  feet up where there is the
next larger barrier of webbing and the two
unmoving humanoid forms wrapped up there
 Okay They both impact and the bodies shift
theres a burst of flame Some of the webbing
ignites and burns and curls away but it looks
like the flame is so instantaneous its not enough
to immediately ignite the webbing There is a
burnt mark on them and neither of the forms move
or react to the impact and the web shifts and
shakes for a moment before it eventually comes to
rest again
 Okay you do it a second time It burns a
little more as the webbing burns away in that
section you can see the crownsguard armor
chestplate that is now a little bit charred
beneath the impact
 Theyre all still in the back but you can
move forward if you want to move forward
 Okay
 Okay you shift yourself  feet behind
Make a perception check so you can watch With
disadvantage because unfortunately youre away
from the torch light to do so
 So youre keeping watch

 As one after the other the webbing is
shaking and shifting Eventually after four or
five blasts the web begins to catch fire and you
watch as the red and orange flames expand and
begin to immolate both the unmoving bodies The
webbing then burns away and eventually begins to
detach from the weight and the loss of tensile
strength and that whole wall shifts and collapses
to the ground both of the bodies hit the ground
The webbing burns away its not enough to catch
the bodies on fire though it does singe and burn
the exterior and as you look theyre both in
various states of decay The skin you can see as
you approach a little bit Yasha to take a look
the cheeks within their helmeted heads are sunken
and sallow The lips are curled back over the
teeth They are drained of any internal life force
or blood
 Make an investigation check
 Prodding around yeah there is From just a
glance they both have coin purses on their belts
folded into their belt as a protective measure
They both look like they were caught in a state
where theyd be willing to travel anywhere and
spend money
 Okay you being to pull from their bodies
what are the rest of you guys doing
 Glancing about as you inspect the bodies
theres no identifying tag to them There isnt an
elaborate system of maintaining Crownsguard
members or identifying that youve noticed at
least
 Make a medicine check
 Sure easy enough to do
 They do They both are carrying a longsword
Theyre well kept not used You look along the
blade and there are barely any signs of
indentation
 No but they are uniform design Theyre not
elaborate or ornamental The Crownsguard weaponry
are all pretty much designed or provided by a
similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel
like theyre uniform to a certain degree
 Thats enough Its not too hard to see As
you look over each of the two bodies both of them
have heavy puncture marks either right in the
back of the neck on one of them or the other one
has it right under the front of the chin The
puncture marks are about that wide about two
inches across on each side where the skin and
flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side
and they go very deep in
 Make a perception check
 There would have been some general webbing
towards the base of this but youve burned away
that central area As you step forward you look
beyond where that burning mark is and there is a
stark left turn It curves to the left and looking
around the side it curves again to the right
maybe  feet beyond that and you see another
webbing barrier where there looks to be three
different figures You see now there is another
figure that is not part of the webbing barrier but
is just webbed to the wall right next to it
 Unimpeded to the point it would be an
issue
 No you feel a little bit of stickiness when
you step around from general fallen bits of stray
webbing strands and such but nothing that would
impede your movement
 You can go try to either the one behind you
or the one ahead
 To the one ahead
 Okay You come forth to the web there in
front of you to where the two other figures that
are massed there They are both humanoid and you
now look over at a close glance as a third one
small looks to be another one of the rat
creatures that is caught in there You carve
through Go ahead and make an attack roll Roll
damage for the handaxe
 Seven okay You carve through and a large
part tears through before your handaxe stops and
youre like  cant push any more You try
and pull back and as you do you pull your arm
back and it gets ripped from your grasp and its
now stuck and folded and your handaxe is now
wobbling in the web
 Okay You begin to carve around it and pull
it out and you eventually get it free but now
theres a cluster of webbing around it almost like
the worlds worst cotton candy Its wrapped
around the center of it but its sticky
  The metal hits the ground and
makes a bit of a sound
 No but the metal still hits the ground
 You watch as the flames burn around it and
free it It lights up the vicinity a little bit
Theres that wedge opening where youve cut in
that webbing barrier and behind it you can see the
entire floor of the next portion appears to have
some sort of webbing layer around it and all the
walls are covered in it Across the way you can
see rungs and the end of this portion of the
drainage that leads up into where you can see the
wind would be coming through and that faint bit
of wind thats pushing through thats causing all
the webs to shift is coming from what you can
barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset
light peeking through another exit A sewage exit
just like the one that you came in You also see a
number of other figures that are all webbed to the
walls and encased within there
 Make a perception check
 You can yeah
 You glance past in the distance Its too
hard to see unfortunately because the torchlight
is too far away
 Well youre at the second web wall Thats
about   feet from you so its beyond the
torchlight of where youre standing
 It looks like it It goes to a dead end but
its all covered in webbing
 Because of your rite you manage to carve
through and you watch as the second web wall comes
and folds to the end The bodies that are encased
in it hitting the ground with heavy thuds You can
see the other bodies that are webbed to the walls
around On the inside you can see the end of
this It is a giant web nest
 As you walk past the ground itself is
sticky You can still move but youre hindered
somewhat having to like pull through and it tugs
at your feet You guys watch as webbing tears and
builds on the bottom of her boots as she walks
in
 Okay You stop and look and you can see the
faint outline of bodies that are webbed to the
wall Parts of the faces that are revealed that
are gray and lifeless drained On the far wall
you see a large cluster of webbing It looks like
a mass of three or four bodies jammed together and
you see one body thats right next to where the
rungs are that is not as webbed as the others and
there is color to the skin You see elements of a
humanoid face A halfling it looks to be About
halfling sized It is about a foot up off the
ground webbed to the wall one arm is drifting
out and part of the face and unconscious but is
not gray and dead like the others And thats
where were going to take a break
 I know Well come back on that Its

bathroom including myself I have to pee like a

of our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway
Congratulations to scopewar Scopewar you are the
winner Well get that out to you so well done
Bringing us back in You guys had just noticed the
furthest element of this segment of the sewer
where the webbing had become far more apparent
You had discovered a few bodies that came over
You had carved through one wall and caused that to
fall off to the side and leading to the very end
of it you saw an ascension that went to another
exit grate into the city A number of bodies one
large webbed mass of a few bodies and one
individual that looked to be still alive though
unconscious and webbed against the wall
 From you right now hes about  feet ahead
of you
 From you guys all together its about 
feet  feet Jester is a little bit closer
 Make a perception check
 Okay Fjord you shift around to join Nott in
the back and you guys look off in that distance
You see nothing in the darkness behind you Who
else is doing what
 You move forward next to Caleb as well You
guys are finding your feet sticking to the
material of the floor webbing You approach You
watch as the head of this halfling is pulled away
from some of the webbing and lifted up It is
male Actually because youre still with Yasha in
the back make a perception check both of you
 Its low light beyond that so make a
perception check with disadvantage
 You can make a straight perception check if
youd like
 You can if Yasha comes closer but Yasha has
the only source of light
 The Dancing Lights appear in the air and
begin to drift in help fill out the area your
torch light still being this larger beacon of
flame light in the space Beau you glance ahead
and can see as the chin is lifted a thick band of
tattoos
 A thick band of tattoos that completely
encompasses the neck to the point where whats
exposed from beneath its like black shapes and
designs completely around
 Of the halfling yeah
 Did you roll a natural 
 Your amazing monklike sight theyre not
fresh
 Theyre not fresh
 You do not
 Also theres this weird sense that creeps
on Nott and Fjord as youre glancing forward and
you both turn over your shoulder to see a massive
pale white and blue arachnid creature legs
spindling outward at a width of ten feet or more
Giant dripping fangs and beady red eyes a row of
them glaring right at you as this  pincers
open up
 Its right behind Fjord and Nott and it is
striking you Fjord as its first strike
 Its literally here
 That is going to be a  to hit
 You suffer seven points of piercing damage
as its fangs snap right into your chest area Do
you still have ice armor on
 I also need you to make a constitution
saving throw
 You feel venom pulse into your body Your
physicality however being somewhat sturdy
manages to resist a large element of the poison
that is suddenly thrust into your torso You
take thats a terrible roll You take five
points of poison damage Nott you look up and see
this thing as it digs its giant pincers and fangs
into Fjords body and it pulls back and you watch
it vanish and disappear
 I need you all to roll initiative
 The last place you saw this
 The last place you saw it was there before
it disappeared
 Right there
 These are all the bodies that have been
webbed up Initiative order for you guys please
 to 
 Nice
 All right Jesters up front at   to
 guys
 All righty that was ten to  Ten to
five
 Beau and Molly All righty and ten to
five
 Thats true
 The top of this round Jester youre up
first
 No Well you hear like the reaction of
pain and you glance over just in time to see this
large monstrous spider body vanish in place
 Nott is just
 Oh do you have one there
 Yes but it appears to have been moved since
they used the table last time Oh well
 It might have happened yeah
 Where shall we place this
 Okay well put it there It worries me that
I get to unveil that and its not around
 Its fine Jester you use that as your
bonus action to cast What are you using your
action for
 Sacred Flame is a cantrip
 You can sure
 Okay you watch as the large lollipop
apparates in that space and you cast Sacred Flame
It has no target to effect
 No theres no burst of flame The spell has
no target
 The space all this area here where the
webbing starts is considered rough terrain to move
through So your speed is halved moving through
that area
 Okay So you back up onto the rocks and
start pulling your feet out of the webbing as you
do That ends your turn
 Ending Jesters turn Caleb and Fjord you
guys are up
 I can say you can start to get into it It
doesnt offer you any cover at the moment but
youre in it right now
 He doesnt seem to be
 Okay
right above me
 Ending Calebs turn You are currently
blurring and shifting
 Nope
 Currently no
 You can
 Make a main attack roll
  It hits the stone wall behind it
Its not there
 You get the sense that its not apparently
there
 That ends your turn That brings us to all
right So
 There is a moment Fjord as you back up
after releasing your Eldritch Blast where it
impacts the wall and youre like Shit You hear
this  sound and look your right and it
appears right next to you
 It lunges out towards you again
 That is eight points of piercing damage and
I need you to make a constitution saving throw
 All right you take  points of poison
damage
 As the fangs dig into the side of your
torso you pull back and try and defend yourself
and it pierces your leather armor in your torso
It releases a huge burst of venom into your chest
You feel your lungs and heart seize for a moment
and you almost fall back That burning orcish rage
from underneath gives you that last bit of
inspiration to shrug off the poison and look back
angrily and realize you are in deep shit
 All righty that ends its turn That brings
us to Beau and Molly
 Is it bothering you
 Its been bothering you this whole time
 Laura Bailey the kind of friend that tells
you when you have a booger in your nose I really
appreciate it
 You can certainly try Go ahead and make an
athletics check You are standing in webbing so
its being able to
 I will say yes I will give you the ability
to leap through and land off to this side using
your movement and avoid that ten feet and still
manage to free yourself from the webbing So that
was  feet of your movement used to leap
 Yep
 Lets give it a shot
  Youre not quite close enough
 No you have whatever monk abilities that
you have You have eyes on it at the moment yes
 You start defending yourself preparing for
its onslaught That brings me to Mollys turn
 Youre right there
 It rolls a natural  on its saving throw
 Thats like three s in a row that it has
rolled by the way
 Well the last two I was using the Golden
Snitch This one I used the black d
 It was gifted to me at the end of the last
campaign
 You must invite the vampire in for it to
cross the threshold

 So Molly you moved up there and youre
still ten feet away from this creature
 All right so youre holding
 Okay so youre holding your action in case
it shows up within range to strike it Okay good
to know That finishes their turn Yasha youre
up
 Whats your speed
  feet  Just in range
 It spins around after Molly screamed at it
and it goes  You can see in your torch
light as youre clutching it in your hand as you
rush towards it Youre going to have to drop that
torch to grab your twohanded weapon
 You drop it on the ground and as it hits
the ground the light flickers off of its eight
red beady eyes It turns its fangs open towards
you and you see the venom and bits of Fjord blood
dripping off of the end of it as you rush towards
it All right you rage what are you doing
 Go for it roll for attack
  hits Roll damage
 Its d for your greatsword Plus whatever
your strength
 Oh the greatsword yeah d is greataxe
d plus three plus whatever your rage damage
bonus is which I think is two right
 Yeah its plus two Its plus five damage
to whatever you roll
 Yep
  points of slashing damage
 It shrieks back Its hurt but its still
doing fine Is that the end of your turn
 Yeah
 Got it Nott youre up
 That hits Roll damage You get sneak
attack
 As it opens its mouth the firelight from
the torch flickering in its horrible weirdly
shaped spiderlike mutated mouth open up where the
pincers and the giant fangs are A bolt sinks into
its throat and it starts shrieking backing up
defensively the pain causing it to pull away from
you Thats a serious amount of damage
 Okay Make a stealth check
 Good to know That finishes Notts turn
Jester youre up
 It really did stick to it Five ten 
there
 Yes you see right where everyone is and
where this creature is
     
It cannot quite get into range
 Because yours can only move  feet
 I believe thats the case
 Cure Wounds is touch I believe
 There it is
 Okay Whats the
 Well it needs to make a saving throw right
That is an  I think your DC is  right Yeah
Roll damage
 Two points radiant damage Hey it all
helps A burst of radiant flame suddenly
encompasses the front part of its body between
the impact of the bolt the slashing from Yasha
and the blast it looks like its starting to feel
a moment of fight or flight That end your turn
 Caleb Fjord youre up
 It does have partial cover though because
of the angle youre at
  Thatll improve your sight
there
 That unfortunately does not hit As its
reacting from the impacts it begins to rear back
and as it does theres this one flash of light It
seems like it notices its presence and gets really
low and flat suddenly Its whole body which is
massive shrinks low to the sewer as it passes
overhead It pops back up ready
 That ends your turn
 All righty Its now the spiders turn
 Thats right I forgot
 Yes you may
 You may Make your three attacks with
disadvantage because its a ranged attack in
immediate facetoface range
  misses The first one goes wide second
strike
 Goes wide again
  does hit Your first time using the
glove youre not too sure how the aiming works
and the first two go off to the side youre like
Shit Shit  The third one finally
impacts Roll damage for that
 Eight points of fire damage Plus does your
Hexblades Curse do anything on that Dont you
add your
 Its ten right
  The second the Scorching Ray
blast hits it as its rearing upright now and as
it lights up you can see the streaks of blue
designs across its pale white body The flames
impact and burn around the side it pulls back
ready angrily back towards you That ends your turn
 It didnt happen
 Its trying to decide what is the biggest
threat right now Im going to roll for it
between Yasha and Fjord
 Its going to go for Yasha
 You watch as a vein pours out the side and
the currently six intact red eyes of the spider
all cloud over black with bits of trickling dark
purplish blood pouring from the edges of them
That gives it disadvantage Which you are very
lucky it is because that was a natural  That
still comes to  Does that hit
 You take from the fangs as it lurches
towards you oof thats going to be  points of
piercing damage
 Yes because youre raging

 You take five points of piercing damage and
I need you to make a constitution saving throw
please
 As it lurches forward and slams its fangs in
the collar bone area you having no real armor to
protect it you take it head on The fangs sink
and you feel the venom pulse through your torso
through your arms The burning pains goes through
and you flex it off As you do so thankfully
reducing what would have been you only take 
points of poison damage
 It now sees you all moving around it and it
looks like its been hurting You watch as its
form vanishes
 Yeah You watch as it vanishes from the
space Thats where you last saw it
 Ending its turn Beau and Molly youre up
 You cannot make a bonus action attack on a
held action so you cannot unfortunately make a
Flurry of Blows I dont believe as a held
action
 No unfortunately
 Okay so youre holding your action until it
appears into range Good to know Molly
 Okay You step back and stumble over one of
the crownsguard bodies that you left on the
ground but you hold yourself there using it as
one foot slightly elevated platform being at the
ready Youre holding your attack action
 That ends Mollys go Yasha youre up
 It appears to have vanished
 To there
 You can yeah
 As Yasha backs up against the wall
greatsword in one hand you watch as she puts her
arm to her chest Theres a faint glow of very
faint whitish energy and her wounds heal up
slightly
 That finishes your turn Yasha
 Well Mage Hand is an action to cast so you
cant hold
 Oh no with your legerdemain right
 Oh it means once its already out you can
do that to use a bonus action But you have to get
it out
 So youre holding your action there
 Good to know Top of the round Jester
youre up
  You can get up to him
 Anything else you want to do Move your
spiritual weapon or anything
 Okay so there
 No That ends your go Jester Caleb and
Fjord youre up
   
 Yes you can
 Okay Good to know That ends your turn
Caleb Fjord what are you doing
 Okay In case he comes into range
 Good to know Okay End of your turn Last
you saw it there You watch as theres a faint
ripple in the air You just finishing healing
Fjord as he runs past you turn and smile and
turn back just in time to see it not far from
where it vanished appear right there
 It does get a surprise strike on you which
has advantage Disadvantage thanks to your last
ability so its just a straight attack roll
That is a natural one
 Thats okay It will use its movement to
move down and go up the wall here
 If we went by those rules you guys wouldve
been dead a long time ago All right so you do
get an attack of opportunity on it as you swing
past Go ahead and make your strike
 With your somewhat webcovered
 Right
  hits By the way those of you that were
in range to attack with that held action wouldve
been just Caleb and Nott Both of you guys get
attack
 You were holding your attack you said
 You have to say what spell youre holding
Its either Im holding an attack or Im holding a spell
 Now you know
 Seven damage nice
 A total of nein
 So  and as you throw your orb it
skitters up the wall You almost hit it but it
pulls out of the way before it shatters the orb
splattering acid across the stonework burning
through whatever outer layer of thick liquid has
congealed there
 From where it appeared That wouldve been
 feet from you
 Yes you do
 Goes wide no impact unfortunately That
ends the spiders turn Beau Molly youre up
 Its above you on the wall
 Ill tell you what Ill give you the
attack youll have disadvantage and if you miss
youre prone But Ill give you the attack if you
want to
 There is a path that helps with that but
not this thing
 All right you leap up to get your single
attack on it with your bo Go for it Roll at a
disadvantage
 Thats pretty slick
 That hits Roll damage
  points of damage As you leap and smack
it in the face it pulls up a little bit further
away screeching at the impact Its looking
pretty rough Its still around but that was not
a positive hit for it
 I gave you the one Youre technically just
out of range
 That was part of the risk That end your
turn
 Molly
 Yeah your spell DC would be eight plus your
proficiency which is ten Plus your wisdom
modifier which is what
 Three Yeah that hits Roll damage
 How do you want to do this

 As you mock the spider to death
 As you screech out this phrase in
Infernal
 As its legs begin to skitter upward and as
it tries to escape up the top of the ceiling it
loses its grip upon the top of the sewer ceiling
It falls slamming on the ground next to Beau and
its legs begin to curl in As its shaking you
see blood pouring from wounds that werent there
before It seems the Infernal itself has affected
him physically from the inside It begins to curl
its legs in deeper and deeper the sound of its
guttural shrieking getting softer and softer
 There you go
 Okay
 Thats true
 So it is a large body The actual thorax of
it
 Okay Easy enough to do Its legs are
intact and theyre sturdy enough You bring out
whatever robe you have available and you start
binding it and getting it in a position where it
could probably be either on her staff or whatever
else you have and carry over shoulders You guys
draped out from the webbing
 It is very dark and theres still this
torch left in the center there where Yasha dropped it
 Sure You grab the torch and you bring it
over You get a close look Theres the web mass
in the corner Theres the other bodies on the
side The halfling looks to be injured in the
sense that it looks like they took a blow to the
head Theres a slight bit of blood trickle along
the hairline
 Okay Go ahead and roll for the hit points
regained there
 Theres a moment after you finish casting it
where the halfling shakes the head Whats going on
 You see one eye is almost still glued shut
from webbing thats across the front of it but
hes trying to open it I dont understand
Whats going on
 Oh god  He starts
looking around looking up at the faint bit of
light now which its now just passing sunset You
see a little bit of purple light coming through
and through the little bits of webbing you can
see the grate that leads outside He goes I
dont know how I got here
 Well I Yeah I guess
 Well I was just trying to get somewhere
quickly
 Make an insight check You see flames
bursting at the side Every time he flinches
 
 Im sorry Im just oh god and he looks
over and sees the other bodies on the wall and the
webbing Hes just  Help me
Please help me
 Okay He nods Thank you back to you in
Halfling Hes beginning to cut him free What did
you say
 Yeah well its important when youre an
ale hand You got to move product through the
sewers quickly
 Ale
 Not a key but I I have a key
 You have to cut me free first
 Thed
 Thed
 Ill be happy to show you once you cut me
free
 Make an investigation check At a closer
look too you can see hes got short spiky dark
hair and a little bit of a goatee thats trimmed
to a point at the end of the chin The tattoos all
across the neck look like theyre swirled
serpentine shapes that all fold and knot together
all across the throat from front to back like a
giant dark band
 Its a tattoo yeah
 Make an intelligence check
 Yeah you dont Okay You cut him free
hes like 
 You do find hes wearing some nice
blackgray leather armor He has a pretty
nastylooking shortsword Its been altered to be
jagged at the edge of the blade He has a small
leather case thats tucked in the armor Dont
find a key
 Hes free now as you cut him free and hes
like  He stands up and he rights
himself and checks everything and he looks to the
left and goes Um He points to the mass in the
corner and you see the mass thats there Its
not a series of bodies It looks like its a
slowly pulsing sac of some kind
 One of them  
 With a torch throwing and landing and the
Sacred Flame igniting it you watch as this
cluster begins to burn as these tiny white and
blue spiders begin to expand out the side Some of
them make it up the sides of the wall
 You rush up and like crush a couple of them
Even babysized theyre about that big Theyre
all coming up and they begin to burn
 You go and start burning It appears youve
got them all Some of them seem to have burned
some of them seem to have vanished Its hard to
tell
 If you go to the other bodies you get two
sets of Crownsguard armor and two longswords of
the Crownsguard
 Right the total between those two was 
gold  silver and  copper
 You do and you go through Itll take you a
little while to go through all the bodies here so
well get to see how many you get through here
 Hmm
 Well I believe it would because it is a
volumespace thing Itll take up a lot of space
within the and you have two twofoot by twofoot
spaces on the two sides and then you have the
main eightfoot cube section there so
 You do find another pair of studded leather
armor that has like a sea motif to it Theres
shells pressed into it and a wave pattern on the
edges The person its attached to has a bunch of
tattoos across their body as well that insinuate
a lot of time at sea different names of different
ships that are different points of faded on the
body They may have been a sailor at some point in
their life and has expired under here
 Okay Well the armors a full set so
itll
 Yeah I mean its a leather chest plate
leather arm bands and bracers and then leg plates
as well so its a full set You could probably
fit all that into your bag if its the only thing
thats in your bag
 You stuff it all in there Beyond that
going through them for the sake of brevity here
you find an additional  gold pieces  silver
and  copper
  silver and  copper
 Yeah while you guys are all talking to this
guy Caleb is going from body to body putting
everything in his pockets Hes not being sneaky
over looking down You see me feeling at the
bodies
 Gold pieces  silver and  copper
 I know Its carried over
 Well hes checked all his things and he
goes Okay I thank you all so much for your
help I really appreciate it Youve saved my
life
 Okay as hes doing this he smiles You can
see hes missing two teeth to the side and he has
a septum piercing up in his nose that he rights
and pulls back down again so its visible and hes
like  All right
 Yeah
 Id happily pay you but your friend
already took all my money
 Thats what hes saying
 What if I can be of service Id be happy
to
 I dont know what youre talking about
 I apologize I dont I apologize I dont
know what youre talking about
 Make a persuasion check
 Oh fuck He glances down at you looks
taken aback and returns to you in Thieves Cant
and says And the rest of your compatriots
 Switching back to Common he goes Look I
cannot tell you anything except for if you want
to find him there is a place you can inquire If
I give you any more information and that gets
around I am deader than that spider would have
left me
 He sighs for a second Theres a dive
naught but five blocks from here called The
Evening Nip
 Dont say his name Just walk up to the old
man behind the counter and mention youd like a
drink and while you have no coin youd be
willing to offer many gifts
 Many gifts is the important part Now I
hope thats been of service and I as you seem
to be the types who see it fit to save a person
that you havent met in the bottom of a terrible
sewer I would hope that you would be kind enough
to know that that information did not come from
me and that youve never seen me before in your
entire life
 As I havent seen you either
 Its not very well done
 Yeah No
 Okay
 I mean  He looks up behind him and says
Ive got mine but I need it for my work
 He glances over towards Nott and says
Unless Im mistaken it appears you have a female
friend here who could probably help you get around
that anyway
 Anyway I bid you all adieu He pulls
his hood up over his head and his little halfling
feet quickly carry him back in the direction where
you guys travel the sewer
  Im aware
 No children One of them appears to be a
woman in her s or so A lot of them appear to be
dressed in heavy leathers They may have been
either coming through to try to clear up parts of
the sewer some of them look very poor and may
have come down here in hopes of scavenging
whatever had fallen down into the sewer and
collected over time Some of them appear to be
similarly dressed as Thed or at least have a
somewhat skulkingtype demeanor about their
wares
 No There are a handful that look like they
probably have traveled this route before and got
caught up in it
 Outside of the bodies It looks like there
is broken bits of what would have been furniture
or a cart at some time that got discarded or
shoved down here from above Other than that just
the general refuse youve come across down here in
the sewer
 Yeah you see him
 Make an investigation check on that
 Okay Looking about them and what you can
rummage through hes pretty much naked other than
his underoos Looking through theres like the
Midnight Lorry you dont recognize that name at
all theres one of them thats the Shell Carrier
dont recognize that one Theres one name that
catches your attention it was called the Pink
Giver and it came through your ports at one
point You remember it coming into port you were
paid to take care of it offload things back on
The name itself was derived by a wooden carving at
the front bow of the ship that was of a mermaid
with her arms extended that was gifting a human
heart that was painted with this vibrant pink
color that was its signifying visual Yeah Other
than that nothing particular about it just that
you were like Oh yes I know that ship
 Its on the back
 Its almost universally spoken and as a
language its used for extended ciphers Make an
investigation check
 You can if you want to assist him
 You have advantage on it because shes
helping you
 Okay Glancing about you can see behind the
rungs theres about a twoinch gap across the
wall There is a very very faint scratch into it
that says although not referring directly to
yours it says Money pot
 Yes
 Which catches you offguard because youre
like Thats one of our
 While this is happening what are you guys
doing
 Easy enough to do You have quite a
collection going
 You guys have reconvened youve gathered
your things the spider has been all the legs
have been pulled up and wrapped and you have
either Beaus staff or something else to lift it
with on both sides because its pretty heavy
its going to take two of you to carry
 It would have to be you two its pretty
strong The two of you lift it
 So where are you guys going
 Okay So Whos going first
 As you climb up Nott and look through the
sun has set and the night has gone purple to
dark navy blue as night has taken it You glance
up through and youre looking out into a dark
alleyway You see two sides of an alley shaded
and dark About maybe  feet ahead it opens up
into a fine cobblestone road You can see fine
buildings across the way you see the lanterns are
light in the center of the town You have not been
to this part of the town but its pretty well
kept and no one seems to be immediately around to
hear you
 It is locked
 Go ahead and make a lock picking check
 No its your thieves tools so your
proficiency bonus plus your dex bonus
 Well two isnt it
 Itd be six
  It takes a moment and you have to reach
around the other side and it opens up and the
bars push open The gap here into the back of
this alleyway is about two feet tall Each of you
can get out comfortably That spider is going to
need some squeezing
 You guys one by one get up back topside
You manage to push it through It damages the
body parts of it break and slide off its not
designed to fill through that space but its
still mostly intact
 Not quite that bad but it definitely
doesnt look as pretty on the other side
 So you all eventually gather up at the top
street side Its completely dark the night sky
is above you you can see the warm lantern light
across the various street intersections and along
the path in front of the various buildings You
definitely recognize this Jester This is indeed
the TriSpires district
 It is night it is freshly night
 Yeah its sundown Id say with the time it
took you to scavenge the bodies about  or 
minutes after the suns set completely
 Yeah probably I mean in this district
shops are still open past sundown for a little
bit but the later in the evening it gets many of
them close down Some shops stay open later you
dont know
 So you remark it you close it You guys
step out into the main street and youve traveled
through here before you immediately think oh
thats where the nearest exit gate in the
direction of the hall would be You guys get about
a block before two of the patrolling crownsguard
stop and look at this troupe of people walking
with a giant brutalized spider bright white and blue
 Immediately jogs up both of them Excuse
me what are you doing here
 Takes the writ and they both look at it
The other one has his hand on the side of his
blade each looking very closely at each of you
And you are a motley lot Going through all of
you sneering a bit in the direction of Caleb
 Yeah A bit frightened at the vision of
Yasha and confused at the sight of Mollymauk He
finishes reading the writ Okay very well but
we will escort you to the gates and you can
continue this on to the hall
 How did you get this in here
 Looks back at the other guard and they
share a brief glance Right very well Let us
leave then They escort you towards the
entrance The opening gate where you guys had
passed through you move through and out into the
Interstead Sprawl at the exact gates where you
guys had entered or you had entered and you had
attempted the night before
 I didnt well the Nestled Nook did you
say
 He points over that way he goes To the
south side of the Silken Terrace look for the
small greenish hutlooking building
 They escort you out  Get you
quickly out of the district carrying a giant
bloodied awfullooking spider As youre making
your way some of the folks that are walking
through start gasping at the sight and whispering
to each other pointing Some begin to approach
and somebody else grabs their shoulder and pulls
them back You become this slowmoving sight
through this district
 All right you guys eventually make your way
back to the hall
 So youre outside the Kings Hall As you
approach some of the guards rush up to you and
Hail What do you carry and bring here to the
What is this thing
 You bring him in Some more of the guards
begin to gather around and then Voloshin is pulled
from his interior office somewhere As he steps
forward he says All right they tell meoh
goodness me Thats a beastie He tugs on the end
of his chin beard for a second So this is it
this is the one
  Someone wake up Cloen
 Cloen and he was the one survived
 Cloen
 Cloen
 He goes to the other guards Go down there
double check make sure everything is good go
Eventually you watch as another guard is brought
in He has a night shirt on and he looks
like he was woken up hes a little drowsy
Whats going on I oh That thing thats the
thing He looks immediately scared He
goes Great send him back to bed Well thats
what we needed
 You look like just the person I would take
advice from when it comes to administrating my people
 Im impressed I will go ahead and retrieve
your payments to the Mighty Seven
 Im sorry to hear that thats terrible
 Make a deception check

 He goes Thats really too bad Anyway
Ill be right back
 That is property of the Crown thank you
very much
 If you would be as kind to remember these
fallen soldiers who protect you and the people of
this city by delivering unto us the armor and
weaponry that they had been lost with I would be
happy to go forward with delivering your reward
 Two of the guards collect them
 He comes back They bring a small chest
  gold pieces Hand me the writ please
Thank you very much and I appreciate that and
he sets it out and hands it to you So You seem
ablebodied Youve pulled through on something
where few have been able to If youre looking for
more work Im sure well have things Bit light
at the moment but where can we find you if were
looking for you
  Of course you do Leaky Tap
good to know All right now shove off
 Well of course you do
 Of course she does
 Ah Fair play Now shove off
 As the Herald turns and Voloshins there
the guards gather the armor and the weapons and stuff
 Okay Good to know
 A voice comes through the hall and goes
Wait Id like to meet them Voloshin stops and
goes Of course Lawmaster He steps back and
from around the side of the hall from one of the
doors on the left side of the building a human
woman comes through in her early s Oncebrown
hair has turned mostly gray and shoulderlength
its curled up a bit into a soft bob on the sides
Shes older her face is weathered and has seen
some time Shes wearing robes of gold and white
but they seem to be not ceremonial or at least worn 
enough to the point where they look like theyre worn for
comfort She steps forward and she has these warm
brown eyes that peek through this face Sorry to
bother all of you Word just came to me that you
were successful in taking care of this beast in
the sewers I am Lawmaster Orentha and I just
wanted to extend my thanks Its not often that
folks are willing to go to lengths and put their
lives on the line for the honor of those fallen of
the Crownsguard and those within the Hall of the
King so I just wanted to say I appreciate that
 The Crown appreciates it the people of the
city appreciate it and I appreciate it Thank
you She turns around and shuffles back into the
hallway Everyone goes about their business again
and begins shoving you off towards the door
 Whats the casting time on Identify again
 You guys would be exiting the building just
as youve finished that process You complete it
take a moment to think it over and you hear them
all exiting and talking to themselves as theyre
ribbing Beau on the way out You quickly gather
your things
 Yup That was it thank you for watching
 You guys are back at the Kings Hall back
in the Interstead Sprawl
 I thought I was pretty clear Everyone else
got it
 Thats okay
 I know Right now its close to 
 

Its still early eveningish
 You guys easy enough find your way back to
The Leaky Tap where you can utilize the washroom
to get yourselves back to a personable state
 Its a darker gray but elements of where
its been pressed in with leather scrolling
designed to look almost like waves curling on the
outer parts of the different leather plates have
a very faint turquoise inlay color on the inside
that you can only see when its directly lit It
looks like a very beautiful set of leather armor
Theres no arms to it other than the bracer
plates right there theres no sleeve There you
go Its got an arm guard and a bracer there
shoulder piece the torso portion a couple of
plates that go over that and some leg guards
 What are you guys doing
 Well say you got clean for the expediency
of the story We dont have to roleplay through
your bathing individually
 Unless you really want to Always stop me if
you want to have a moment
 No you went back to The Leaky Tap
 This isnt medieval times In the fantasy
world its a weird mixture of different time
periods and when I say they have a washroom I
mean its a basin with water that is replaced
every couple hours that people communally come up
and wash in Its not the cleanest water and its
probably been used by other people as well and if
you bathe fully in it it might be changed before
the next two or three people use it
 In your house They have one washroom for
the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has and
the water is changed every few hours maybe
Thats what Im saying But its functional
 Okay Go ahead and make a stealth check
 
Would you have taken your stuff in with
you
 Molly would probably still be in the room
 You do Make a perception check Molly
 You watch as Nott slowly creeps into the
room heading over towards Fjords pack
 I mean
 All right You finish your baths you all
convene down in the tavern Yeah When you guys
come down there and begin to reconvene about two
tables away you see sitting alone with a tankard
a familiar dwarven figure to both Beau and Fjord
 Ulog who you had met before
 Ulog with a G
 Yeah you watch as you guys approach and as
soon as you all gather at the table he gets up
and walks over
 He seemed to be yeah
 He walks behind where Fjord and Beau are and
goes Dont mean to bother you but if I could
have a moment of your time Id like to talk
 Excuse us He leads you guys back to where
the cellar is
 You guys head back he nods over towards
your dragonborn bartender gives him a nod walks
past leads you down to the same cellar its dark
in there Theres no light but he lights a hooded
lantern as you enter and it gives this low
mysterious atmosphere in the shadows as he spins
around and goes
Ive been watching you a bit Youre a curious
lot More of you than came to the meeting Five
more Did you and please be honest Im good at
telling otherwise did you reveal any of our
sentiments to your of our moot to your
companions
 Went and saw you come back to town with
this spiderbeast you had on your shoulders now
thats take it youre pretty good with a sword
maybe With a bow Experienced Whats your skill
sets if I might ask beyond just being curious
 Thats a little strange not going to lie
 Yeah
 Understood
 Curse upon ye who made that decision for
you
 So you can move quickly without a ruckus
you say
 And your friends do they share our
sentiments
  Listen If you indeed have a
heart for goodness in this world and you want to
make a difference were moving on to something
soon that I think we could use your aid on You
and your companions Blast if you need payments
Ive got coin I can muster and I see you do work
for coin I have few others of us who can chip in
as well Other than myself most of the Knights of
Zadash are unskilled in the ways of the arm Were
willing to raise a voice but not much of a fist
or backing up a word with strength Im willing to
make it worth your time
You dont have to answer now Tomorrow at
midnight me and a few others from the group the
decision makers were meeting back down here If
youre in bring your friends we can all talk
Give you more information about whats going on
and you can say yes or no at your leisure But I
think we have a chance to really do something good
in this city To change part of the status quo To
root out some of the unworthy at the top Think on
it
 Were not against the Empire It protects
us There are good things about it What were
against are the people that abuse the system
There are a handful in this town and their time is up
 Your curiosity is piqued Come by Well
talk
 Well weve been talking for a very long
time and there is a shift coming that we want to
ride the wave of Ill let Dolan tell you the
details tomorrow Anyway He snuffs the lantern
Good night
 All right You guys reconvene with the rest
of the group
 You guys are in the tavern at the table but
youre keeping your voices somewhat discreet
 No one seems to be paying immediate
attention
 For the sake of brevity Since its getting
late and I want us to get to a good ending point
tonight they will let you in but nobody else
 Its not the same guards you met before and
they take your key but they look towards the
rather roughlooking large scary barbarian
woman they look towards the very shiftylooking
multicolored tiefling they look past the while he
is wearing a cloak still rough grimylooking
wizard and they begin to fixate directly on the
tiny green but white maskskinned halfling
creature thing in earmuffs thats squinting very
hard and they begin to really pry in that
direction before you start thinking this is not
going to go well if I keep going
 You know one dive
 All righty Let me pull this up real fast
Easy enough to find You head to another section
of the Interstead sprawl
 No you have not been You come to what is a
small darkwood rough and tumble dive bar with
two very dangerouslooking guards at the outside
You see these thicker human guys one who is
completely bald pale skin big square chin that
looks like its been broken in multiple places who
has his arms crossed The other one looks to be a
spindly guy whos sitting there daggers sheathed
on both sides and they both watch you as you
enter and they both just stare
 Yeah Which is interesting because you
expect for them to go through that it would be a
really rowdy place but its very quiet You walk
inside and aside from the central candlelit
chandelier that is almost obtrusively laid from a
low ceiling with a number of small booths that are
built out of wood as well it has a classic
OldEngland pub feel but everything smells of
dried beers and ale and rotted wood You only see
two other patrons in there that are at separate
booths drinking alone and across the way you see
this very very old dwarf with half of his beard
burned away and this perpetual grimace Hes
sitting there looking out As you enter he perks
up Aye Can I help you
 Yeah
 If I can ask what youre celebrating
 Thats a pretty good reason to celebrate
Drinks coming right up He goes and gets you guys
a number of drinks The basest most bitter ale
youve had but its functional
 They call me Clive
 Clive Bens and this is my bar
 Pleasure as well
 Never be too careful Dangerous times
Riots breaking out in the cities in the empire
Folks coming through you got to be prepared
Dont want to be taken advantage of
 No but thats why I keep my front His
eyes are locked in on you
 No its just kind of creepy
 Sorry just dont get a lot of your types in
here
 Pretty
 Then dont start any Finish your drinks
Enjoy He slips them out
 Theres no conversation Two people at
separate booths that are drinking by themselves
and theyre all looking at you
 Theres two other guys one of them is a
younger plump human male has a tuft of a red and
grey goatee at the end of his chin No hair on top
of his head The other guy looks to be human as
well hes older in his forties he glances over
at you hes clutching a tankard and you can see
he has a very familiar tattoo around his neck
 The tattoo Its not him but its the
tattoo
 Yeah You dont know if its directly the
same but its a similar tattoo to Thed who you
met earlier
 This place is maybe  feet by  feet Its
very small The floor appears to be wood boards
there are a couple doors that leave into a kitchen
or storage area Its a tiny fucking dive
 You guys finish your terrible ale and you
leave
 Thanks for coming by have a good night
 You guys leave and the two guards watch you
leave
 Im thirsty and have been out of water and I
keep going to drink nothing thats there I do it
so much and I hate it
 Its fine Because as you
 Do you guys leave
 Okay You gather your things up you leave
out into the street to go onto the next leg of
your evening adventure and thats where well
close tonights episode

 It is 
 well pick up next week as you
guys are leaving the Evening Nip to whatever other
business you want to go towards
 I feel like it would be wonderful and I
feel like there would be a lot of very angry
disappointed people
 I know hes old and stinky
 And on that note folks have a wonderful
night and is it Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back Last we left off The Mighty
Nein the intrepid adventurers had completed
their task they had achieved from the Kings Hall
Taskboard to eliminate this spider scourge that
had seemingly clogged up a portion of the sewers
discovered a subtle passage into the more upper
class elements of the city managed to extract
some information from an individual they had saved
from the webbing there got your reward for it
had a conversation with Ulog of the Knights of
Requital who had discussed interest in possibly
bringing you in for some endeavor
 Ulog You had also as the evening
progressed finished your night checking out the
Evening Nip a tavern that seemed extremely shady
Having some pisspoor ale you had just exited the
exterior of the taverns location out into the
midnight evening air of Zadash still a bit
bruised and beaten from the battle earlier in the
day but eager to continue with what your next
endeavor is Mighty Nein what would you like to
do
 As the evening rainfall begins to fall a
bit harder from a soft drizzle to a decent
pour you hear the distant rolling and crackling
of thunder as a storm front has slowly brought
its way in as the night has progressed
 From where you are now exiting the Evening
Nip its maybe a minute minute walk to the
middle of the Pentamarket
 Its pretty late evening its pushing on
midnight yeah
 You guys make your way back to the Leaky
Tap heading up to your rooms and eventually find
yourselves falling to sleep However the distant
thunder rolls continue to quake the muffled
interior of the rooms youre at the lightning
strikes flashing through the rooms that have a
respective window and the heavy impacts causing
you to wake up in the middle of the evening at
times with a restless bit of sleep A faint drip of wayward 
rain seems to have collected and found its way
through the roof of Beau and Jesters room and
the pattering in the corner of this small
building puddle causes you to frustratingly go
and collect it find something to at least keep it
from making that noise throughout the evening
 As you guys are having this conversation
 Loosely By definition
 Midwee hours of the morning you catch a
quick glance at Yasha staring out the window at
the storm quietly sitting on the floor
 She glances over Yeah
 Yeah I get that
 You see a hint of a smile at the edge of her
lips and she gives a nod Thats pretty good I
could never draw
 You see her pull back a bit Another flash
a nearby bolt causes the sky to light up Yashas
unfazed and her attention shifts back to the
glass of the window again a brief moment of
trancelike attention before You should try to
sleep
 She gives a nod and sits back down closes
her eyes still sitting in a meditative position
on the ground
 Okay Eventually you all come to
consciousness again sore from the action of the
previous day but the daylight greets you muddled
as it is from the darkened grey raining skies that
greet you The thunderstorm is still passing
through and a quick glance out through the window
into the main thoroughfare you can see the
streets are muddied and in some places gathered
into small pools and flooded puddles but Yasha is
gone
 Thats up to you guys
 You all gather in the main area
 Easy enough to do
 That is better
 You guys gather back in the tavern
downstairs You slept in a little pushing like
nine or ten at this point but it is still gray
and rainy outside You can see carts making their
way through the mud some getting stuck and having
to pull through the beasts of burden trying to
make their way through The tavern interior is
fairly light not a lot of people in there a few
folks that are rushing through to grab a quick
bite and leaving or having a drink in the face of
a rather dreary day But the room is yours What
do you wish to do
 They all slam open loudly Wind and rain
begins to suddenly pour in from the side from the
wind blowing it through All of a sudden the few
folks that are in there freak out
 
 Yeah its an evening meeting
 Do you all divide into your various
endeavors
 As you guys divide into your two separate
groups scattering this side these three heading
over towards the TriSpire The other three of you
guys are heading towards the Pentamarket
 You may
 Sure Make an investigation check What kind
of tailor are you looking for a standard clothing tailor
 It wont take terribly long It takes you a
little longer Although if youre going to the
same place hes already been to then it
completely circumvents that
 You go and inquire They do custom work but
it takes a little bit of time Its a little
pricier as opposed to buying one off the rack
 Itll take about a day for them to finish
the work on it and it will run you about two silver
 If youre providing the cloak Were you
having a custom one made Are you having a liner
put in or having a custom cloak made
 Okay yeah Full purchase of the cloak and
thatll put you about four silver for the full
cloak That includes the work the lining
addition and the time waiting for it
 Okay so hooded cloak and the front and the
back with slits for arms to come through Got it
You have that ordered Itll be ready by midday
tomorrow theyre saying
 You guys are going to make your way to the
Pentamarket At this point in time it is still a
fairly moderate downpour through the day As you
begin to come through some of the carts are
are more open that sell fresh goods or things that
can be ruined by rainwater and that dont have
quite as strong of a canopy but there are some
that are still open They have hooded lanterns out
to draw attention towards them you have barkers
shouting out Meats fresh meats and trying to
get your attention over there but you guys
maneuver through making a beeline to your
location Eventually you come up to the
warmlooking dark wood exterior of the Vulnerable
Vagrant facility
 The Invulnerable
 It appears to be The doors are closed but
it is warm on the inside and upon checking the
door it is not locked
 You step inside the interior and there is
one other patron who is currently in the process
of looking through one of the glass cases in the
far end of the room You can see its a rather
portly looking gentleman probably middleaged or
so His hair is curled and unkempt but pulled
close to his scalp His cheeks are ruddy like the
cold weather has caused him to get a bit flush
and hes in the process of glancing over as soon
as you enter He looks sidelong to your troupe as
you enter and tries to mind his own business
There across the room you can see there are two
Pumat Sols currently one of them smiling and
looking out your direction the other one that is
keeping an eye on the gentleman in the corner The
one that watches you enter gives a big grin Why
hello there
 Well if thats what youre asking I would
be happy to help you
 He walks on over and starts breathing
heavily on you

 His breath is warm There are elements of an
herbal scent that immediately is overtaken with a
 Yeah its not entirely unpleasant but not
pleasant either Its a warm cowbreath smell
 As he takes a deep breath on you once or
twice you feel your body warm up for a moment as
he finishes the Prestidigitation cantrip and you
are suddenly immediately dry
 It is quite literally the least I can
do
 Thats really pretty
 Yeah no thats really pretty
 Havent seen that kind no but I like the
designs on it Its really pretty
 Yeah no thats just a faux pas
socially
 Let me go ahead and have a look at it if
you wouldnt mind There we go theres a few
other pieces right there if you want to hand those
over
 No its all right Oh thats a full
set
 I appreciate that heads up Hey mind
helping me me The other Pumat goes Oh yeah
no worries Pardon me sir Ill be right back
Me could you watch him The other one comes
around the corner Oh yeah no worries Now the
third one has entered the room and is looking
this is a very strange sight for ye who has not
been within the store first
 The one whos in the back goes Well we
only refer to each other as me as were all
technically the same individual There is a Pumat
Prime but hes currently not in the main chamber
Oh I havent seen you around Whats your name
there fellow
 Molly hello to you as well
 Yeah You see the mass of curled hair
around the somewhat pointed furred ears that curl
back The large smile under the broad nose
Very
 Oh hes just a pleasant jolly individual
who is massive in size even with a slight hunch
around the shoulders and back stands a full seven
feet probably
 Oh yeah no worries Just be wary of
anything youre planning to touch over there Oh
and you youre just an adorable little friend
there
 Yeah
 Well were going to go ahead and take
those in the order theyve been received So if
you could respectfully have a moment to yourself
there Well help you as soon as we can Thank
you He turns back around and goes back to
you
 As the two begin to look over one of them
is inspecting the quality of the armor while the
other one closes his eyes and as he begins to
focus you watch as this faint little flash
emanates from the armor briefly He goes Oh
yeah no that there is a pretty simple
enchantment right there There are limitations
based on the strength of the enchantment and how
recently its been applied to the equipment
involved But since this is a simple enchantment
it is something possible to translocate onto a
similar piece of equipment It is a bit there is
a cost to it should you be willing to pay for the
service but we can probably do that for you yeah
 Hold on just a second He goes in the back
room and you hear these two muffled 
 
 He comes back into the chamber So to have
this enchantment transferred over its only going
to cost you about  gold pieces
 Eight zero gold pieces as it does require
some components to both harness extract and
maintain the enchantment when it is put over to
the new piece of equipment
 Well put a little pin in that one You had
a question there little one
  You see unfortunately
 I mean I can sell you a pouch Its just
going to be a normal pouch Part of the haversack
enchantment there is an allencompassing object
We have others if youd like to buy one for yourself
 Yeah
 For a return customer Do you have the
card still on that one
 Right with the charge on it I think the
total cost was a little over  gold

 It was a few hundred at least I dont have
the card in front of me Yeah I
 I mean we could look into possibly
devolving a smallbased enchantment like that I
mean research and development of that does take a
while Youd have to fund the endeavor The good
news is when its done youd be the first to have
an original Enchanter Pumat Sol pocket cozy pouch

 I dont know Ill be right back He goes
in the back room again  Comes
back out Pumat Prime there says that for the
process of research and development should it be
successful development of the object itll
probably be about two weeks of time of enchantment
and the cost of the overall pouch will probably
run you  gold pieces
 Of course
 The large looming figure of Pumat Sol shades
over you and slowly comes down onto his knees
This lurching monolith over your tiny goblin
frame The face gets tense for a second and pulls
back into this very warm toothy smile and goes
Oh I like an inquisitive little girl Pats and
rubs your head The hand is like a giant mitt that
almost encompasses your entire head
 If you look over there He points on the
shards that all point to the center in a flux
capacitorlike design He goes Im actually an
annex of the Cerberus Assembly So I get certain
favors and I do things for them I provide them
occasionally with my capabilities and some
enchanted objects and in return they were kind
enough to provide me with well me and him and
him
 Theyre about the most powerful you find in
the Empire yeah So me and my brothers here are
actually technically were a Simulacrum
 But you know we do what we can
 Well I guarantee with enough positive
reinforcement with enough friendship attained
with certain members like I have developed over
many years of hard work and providing services
perhaps one day you too could be the fine owner of
three other versions of your tiny self
 Not much of a business card They got
members all over Most of them are up in the
capital but there is one of them that runs that
Hall of Erudition Right over in the TriSpires
 Of course happy to help
 Make a persuasion check
 I respect your candor I see that you have
a keen mind for business relationships However I
do have to turn a profit So I cant do much for
you there my apologies
 No those were  gold apiece
 Fair enough That will will run you 
and
  gold pieces thats correct Theres
your healing potion You get your basic one right there
 Itll take about an hour to transfer this
here enchantment for you So be patient and come
back in about  minutes Should be ready to go
 Oh this is want us to clean it for
you
 All right
 Would you prefer black ice lavender or new
leather
 New leather it is Well get it right to
you
 Turns around
 Make an investigation check
 Okay theres a lot of things here Many not
anywhere near your price range
 There are three that catch your eye that are
loosely interesting at least between you and your
allies There is one pendant that has a darkened
ivory spiral and almost a heart sculpture but it
is roughly sculpted
 That is currently labeled with a fine ribbon
at the bottom at  gold It states that it has
the capability of you can almost hear it in his
voice after seeing and meeting him for this short
time Its capable of ensuring that if you take
too many hits it will help prevent you from bleeding
out on your own
 Also when you take a rest you get a
little bit of a bonus when healing
 Theres one of them thats this darkened
orangeish ambercolored orb or marble about that
big That is  gold
 The ribbon attached to that one states
Should someone holding this have the capability
of spinning spells one way or the other they could
probably keep one stored in this thing and release
it at a later time
 Yes this is a really beautiful cloak that
has a purplishblue color to it with very fine
edged embroidery in gold and silver that naturally
comes out of the cloak like its growing silver
vines at the edges of it Its a very fine make
This one is labeled at  gold The donner of
this cloak would find themselves largely protected
in certain ways from the elements or blows or
magics or what have you
 Cloak of protection
 Thats an option
 Oh I assumed
 Yeah it was  gold
 Theres the two guys are like Sorry cant
help you were in midenchantment translocation
Could you help him The other ones like Yeah
no worries I got you Hey there buddy what you
looking at over there for
 Oh yeah no Let me pass you over a little
more information about that Thats a periapt of
wound closure if youre so interested It both
allows you to stabilize when you hit zero hit
points and when youre using hit dice to heal up
its a little bit nicer
 Just when its doing hit dice
 Not going to lie really appreciative to
have just here in a few days returning customers
willing to spend fine hardearned gold on some
finely crafted and enchanted objects
 An absolute pleasure there you say it was
Mollyoop
 Molly it is
 I mean overall it seems to be as fine as
it can be
 You know some folks dont have as much
coin as others but what can you do to really help
them We do what we can but theres a lot of
dangerous things out there We got all sorts of
baddies coming over from Xhorhas we got the
possible encroaching of foreign powers always
looking to peek over the mountain range and try
and steal some of our hardearned materials So I
think its good they keep us nice and safe and I
mean I got myself a fine business too
 Who are you referring to
 Oh no they dont come to the store often
They usually send requests they make orders and I
have them sent on over to either Rexxentrum or the
Hall if thats where theyre going to be
utilizing them
 No worries Theyre a fine bunch They do a
lot of good they keep the Crown in check they
make sure theres no abuse of power and they also
have been very staunch supporters of helping
promote learning here in the smaller more middle
to lower classes here in Zadash
 Well I mean protective of knowledge in
the sense that not everyone can be trusted with
knowledge and Im not going to lie some of the
things even I know could be real dangerous in the
wrong hands so I think its important there has
to be a certain level of control Ive seen some
really nutty people out there that I cant imagine
what it would be like if we didnt have some sort
of law and order
 Could very well be Theyve been very kind
to me
 Well well be here All four of us
 Pleasure to meet you little goblin lady
 I will Right now He goes in the back
room as the other two are still focusing on your
armor As you leave the two that are focusing go
Thank you Thank you
 You wait the better part of an hour are
able to retrieve your armor and indeed you now
have the Mariners armor enchantment on your
breastplate
 Now the three of you So what means are you
attempting to enter the TriSpires
 You find yourselves to the exterior of the
TriSpires the familiar gate where youve
traversed and failed to traverse once before As
you make your way towards the edge you see the
two guards once again step up to the center to
prevent entry As they begin to walk up you see
three other figures are exiting the district and
the guards stop Halt Give a nod recognizing
the individuals as they walk past they move on
They look to be fairly decently dressed a male
and a female You dont know if theyre married or
not but they appear to be a couple A friend of
theirs is off to the side All in cloaks hoods
up very nice cloaks thick but very wellmade as
the rain is still coming down Theyre all bundled
up but there is a point of recognition with the
guards as they pass by As they move beyond the
guards once again approach and theyre like Halt
 Hello again
 They both give a look over the two of you
 For the sake of this make a persuasion
check Jester
 All right Come in You guys quickly make your way
through the open gates under the portcullis into
the cobblestone streets of the TriSpires and there
you see the Silken Terrace the three towers that
mark the central part of Zadash
 I oh He gives you this weird look as
you ask him Hes like Actually its right there
in the Silken Terrace to the left of the large
bakery Its the hutlooking thing
 Of course he says behind you as you rush
off
 Its pretty great
 Bringing in an American Pie reference wow
You enter the Silken Terrace First off the
beautiful cobblestone streets before you are
broken up by small patches of small fencedin
shrubbery and flower bushes The whole interior
here is such stark contrast to the rest of the
city It is both surprising and sickening knowing
some of the harder lifestyles that exist on the
outside of the walls here There are a few large
sights as you pass through here There is one of
the large towers here is part of the ivory and
marble structure that has large blue banners that
hang down the sides The central tower itself
fires up into the sky This centerpiece and
youve known this because youve been here before
is known as the Zauber Spire
 Zauber Spire ZAUBER SPIRE The
Zauber Spire It is the central piece of the Halls
of Erudition campus and lords over that entire
section to the north side It is the furthest
tower here There is an area that youve heard of but
not been to called the Gilded Willows which is
the treedappled residential area of the city
Its broken up into several pieces but you can see a
lot of the treetops and there is this very
natural almost picturesque beauty of the interior
 The Gilded Willows Its the broken up
residential aspects of this area
 Yeah There is the Triumph Chime which is a
sevenstory temple and belfry that has been
retrofitted as the previous and you would know
this from learning your history lessons
actually make a history check
 You might not remember it
 All right You know that its there You
know the three towers are there Theres the
Zauber Spire the Constellation Bridge in the
Gilded Willows which is a giant watchtower that
overlooks the entirety of this city and then the
last bit is the Triumph Chime but thats all you
know about them
 As you continue in the direction of where
you were guided you come upon the very familiar
scent of warm baked goods both savory and sweet
It is relatively crowded A lot of the folks are
bundled up They have large mittens on heavy
coats and cloaks and a lot of the general elite
that live in this vicinity have come here to pick
up warm goods to help go against the cold rain
thats now coming down upon the city To the right
of that towards the very edge of this road of
various shops and market bits there is a building
that is small with a thatched roof like its more
for the visual aspect of it Its made to look
almost like a small country cottage but its
plainly intentional and is an aesthetic thats
been placed onto it to make it look different and
interesting from the rest of the
 Yeah I guess you could say that Outside
you do see a sign that is written in beautiful
cursive thats arched over the main door that says
Chastitys Nook The doorway is slightly open
and there is a warm light from the interior There
is a glass window There are books on display
there but you already see a few people inside
Its not packed but its making business What do
you guys want to do
 You actually cant see the name from the
outside Youd have to go and ask
 Easy enough to ask As you walk inside
there is a whole table set up with warm goods and
a kitchen thats constantly going Theres about
 patrons in there right now in the process of
eating or ordering Its called the Meal Hearth
 If youd like to you can load up on
 In the midst of the chaos you see a young
man in his late teens or so with a little bit of a
prickly chinstrap beard very short tattered
brown hair but other than that spry smiling He
has an apron on and hes currently putting a
small tray on the edge Hello Can I help you
 We have bear claws I dont know if we have
any Nicodranas bear claws
 As far as I know the only major difference
is they load it up with cinnamon
 We can do that Thatll be done How many
would you like
 That we do as well Of course
 Yeah youll have to wait the moment About
  minutes well have a fresh one for you
 So ten bear claws and bread You want to
pay in advance
 So for all the bear claws and the loaf of
bread
 Yeah its not that much
 Probably run you three silver
 Of course See you back here in a minute As
soon as you turn around somebody else has pushed
past you and gotten in the front Id like three
of and youre like ugh this place is awful
 As you enter the small shop the interior is
beautiful and surprisingly busy Theres five
other patrons that are currently perusing through
various tomes and stacks of artwork You can see
it carries many books and different types of
tawdry decor like rugs embroidered tapestries
candles both scented and not and you can smell
oils and incense in there as well Its this
mishmash of scents Its darklit in the interior
but as soon as you enter almost every other
person glances over their shoulder at you and goes
back about their business As soon as you finish
scanning the room a voice peeks up and goes
Hello You glance over and see a human female in
her s mousey brown hair wild and curly that
goes past her shoulders and she has a heavy
sweater on and these big glasses right in front of
her face She goes Can I help you
 Thank you so much It was a gift
 Iva
 Iva Deshin and this is my shop
 A grin curls past her face She goes
Recommended You want to go to that back She
points and you can see now that shes pointed
out because its one long chamber with shelves
and a central table The beginning has more of the
accouterments like the candles and the various
knickknacks you can purchase In the back you can
already see there are large scrolls that are hung
up with beautifully painted nudes You can see
rows and rows of

 I know you did Yeah you did buddy There
are stacks of books where the covers have their
own individual paintings where you can see
 You can see a portion of a moonlight
painting of a brawnylooking man whos dipping a
fainting woman in a delicate dress glistening
across the moonlight Its slightly pulled open
yeah This is the young adult romance section of
any bookstore on full display and the more you
look back you can see theres a few figures in
the process of thumbing through the books reading
them where they stand in the middle there Are
you looking for anything in particular
 Ooh I have recommendations if you like
 Theres Zemnian Nights Very popular
Theres The Enchanting Tryst for those who want
more of a fantastical perspective Scent of the
Sea for the traveler who enjoys their perusal
That one is outer empire so folks have varying
interest Theres Tusk Love That ones a little
more saucy

 If you want something more gentle
something thats more of a classic love story we
have Guard of My Heart Shallow Breaths are a bit
more bawdy
 Right this way
 She leans in for a moment and gives you a
look Follow me She leads you both to the back
She plucks a copy of Tusk Love
 Define historical What are your
interests
 Make a persuasion check
 You made me do this Liam
 Edubation
 Okay Its been banned for the past 
years but I do have a couple of reclaimed copies
of Courting of the Crick if youd be
interested
 Well because its and the voice stays
very hushed and she adjusts her glasses the
closer she gets because it is technically not
supposed to be here its a bit pricier That one
runs you about  gold pieces
 Of course its not a worry Just a
moment The other books the regular books
 Briefly yeah
 Okay
 As you complete your incantation there is a
slight shimmer of energy that expands around the
chamber and scanning through and across the
books nothing peeks out at you as magical from
the shelves It looks theres only a collection of
tomes You get a small blip from the hunched
cloaked figure in the corner thats currently
reading through one of the books hurriedly Just a
faint source of magic on their person
 Okay I will say let me look at the
If anything looks out of reach of the spell
that I have just cast
I will walk in that direction
 Right Its concentration so you can pass
around You scan the entirety of the room It does
not appear to be that there is anything directly
magical being put on any of the shelves
 The only blip of magic source youre getting
is from one of the patrons
 Unfortunately no There isnt a lot of
business for used books here in the TriSpires
Most folks purchase and display on their shelves
Its a symbol of status The more books you have
the more you can display on your shelves the more
wellread you are to your guests as you have them
over There isnt a big market for returning
things youve read
 Okay The one thats closest to you or one
of the other ones
 The one thats closest to you as you
approach from behind he has a dark brown cloak
thats pulled over one shoulder Hes wearing a
sky blue tunic soft a silk sheen to it in what
little bit of lantern light is lighting the
interior From the side of his chin you can see
hes got a softer rounder face and as soon as
you begin to approach as you arent approaching
quietly he stops the book closes back on the
shelf Make a perception check
 It is Shallow Breaths
 Breaths
 As the guy turns around you can see him
Hes mid to late thirties you would expect dark
hair slicked back the hairline pulling back a
bit male pattern baldnessstyle human and as
 I dont know Ive not read it I couldnt
tell you
 I need to go
He pushes past you and as
he begins to exit the chamber he goes Im all
right Im good thank you this time good bye
and darts out into the rain
 It is smutty Were talking like Anne Rice
fairy tale booklevel
 I remember I got really 
 No I got really into Interview with a
Vampire and then my mom got these great new Anne
Rice books and I was like Oh she made new
books about Cinderella thats oh Yeah Its
what youd expect
 At this point Iva returns with a booksized
tome that is covered in a soft deerskin leather
pulls it open and shows you the outside of it
Its very high quality like its barely been
read This is the piece
 You may She looks over to make sure
theyre blocking the view to anybody else
 Interestingly enough it begins almost like
The Silmarillion in the sense that it reads not
very flowery
 It has a very instructional nonfiction
historicaltype speech It begins to talk of early
empirical conflicts It begins to talk of the
postCalamity
It begins to talk of elements of
It begins to hint at the ideas of
forbidden romance between sides that were not
meant to meet A lot of it begins like and then
this person led this army into this place and
these many were slaughtered
 As you begin to flip through she
 I understand if that was enough of a
peek and youre interested you could purchase
 That I do And not a worry She quickly
folds it up and tucks it under her arm and hides
it amongst her sweater Right over here She picks
up a copy the same copy the gentleman was looking
through earlier and hands it to you
 Three silver pieces
 Thank you very much
 That is also three silver pieces
  All right thats  gold
 Okay
 Very terrible discreet handoff where its
like She adjusts her glasses once more Thank
you and its been a pleasure If youre ever
interested I do my own writing and am in the
process of finishing the third chapter of my next
series so
 Well its not done
 Well She gets a little nervous reaches
behind pulls out a small piece of paper and
says I need this back because its part of my
manuscript You can have a glance over it
 At a quick glance it is not very well
written Its a bit hamfisted in its analogies
and descriptives You have caught the middle of a
saucy meeting of a strong strapping farmhand who
is currently trying to work down the cost of a
piece of equipment by the purveyor You dont have
enough information to make out the full story but
its this How can I get this at a cheaper price
 The salesmans like Well I dont know
How much are you willing to pay It goes back and
forth and youre like I see where this is going
but its not going there fast enough
 Do you like it
 Make a deception check
 Shes like Oh good Im so glad you like
it
 Oh well there was a family background
yes Before I took up writing
 I think its rare that I meet people that
are interested in seeing that type of niche Thank
you I hope to have it ready for sale hopefully
within the next three or four months so please do
come by again
 Thank you
 Its kind of a word of mouth thing The
clientele prefer a bit of privacy
 Oh no
 You grab a quick copy of Guard of My Heart
The cover has the actual Crownsguard crest printed
on it It is a dynamic of honor versus what the
heart wants Make a sleight of hand check
 As you quickly whip through the statement
close the book set it on the shelf no one any
the wiser You have a sense of accomplishment wash
over you You hear this faint distant chuckle
that is sourceless but pleased
 You have your smut What would you like to
do now
 Easily enough Its still raining but not
quite the heavy drizzle it was earlier Its
lighting up a little bit As soon as you step
outside you can see way far off in the distance
a little bit of blue begin to break The heavy
part of the stormfront at least is beginning to
pass You pick up the remainder of your ordered
baked goods and a loaf of bread as well
 You slide it under a what
 Just on the counter
 Make a sleight of hand check
  okay He glances up Oh thats more
bread
 Yes of course Fresh Here you are sir
 Any other business youd like to tend to
while youre in the TriSpire or are you joining
your friends
 As you guys make your way to the interior of
the Pillow Trove the same woman clerk who you
met the other day is there in the process of
going through and organizing the last bit of
information of the few folks that got rooms the
night before You see at the top of the split
older in the face You see some lines along the
cheeks that for elves that age gracefully
shows a bit of age You see a very beautiful
laced red dress that goes up to the neck with a
bit of a window right there The arms are crossed
and folded in front and as you enter looks down
and smiles The clerk glances up Oh hello again
 Thats Madam Luenna Madame and the woman
descends the stairs one step at a time arms
crossed Hello Pleasure to make your
acquaintance
 Can I help you
 I am the owner of the Pillow Trove
 Thank you so much I greatly appreciate
it
 Thank you kindly So
 Youre checking out How unfortunate
 Jester Is that your name
 She takes your hand and holds it A
pleasure my dear Good bye
 Turns and makes her way back up the stairs
 You walk upstairs you find the room Its
small the one that you had rented but its
beautiful in the interior The sheets have layered
lace High thread count Its quite awesome There
is a balcony though the curtains currently drawn
because of the rainy day outside Its a very nice
room
 You get a decent view Its not terribly
high up but you get to look down over the street
below you the cobblestones still slick and the
rain pattering on the stonework You see the
fences that curl around the exterior of the
terrace The treetops are now more visible and the
canopy is puffing up behind the larger estates and
buildings that make up the interior of the
TriSpires You have a pretty decent view of the
Zauber Spire from here You see it domes towards
the very peak There is a glass cylindrical top
floor that overlooks the entirety of the city
Make a perception check
 Not too difficult for you to see even
through the bit of rain thats up there but at
the very top where you see the glass exterior you
see the outline of two figures that are standing
looking over the entire city from up there
 Yeah Zauber Spire
 You cant make out the full details of them
from this distance but you can see the basic
shape and outline of two figures looking out
 Jesters just darting around
 You hear Jester say from underneath the
bed
 No Actually its pretty wellcleaned and
maintained underneath there
 I mean do you want to sit and read it like
full If you skim through it you see pages like
some of it smutty some of it seems boring
 If you want to take the time to read it
either now or another time I can give you more
information but scanning through you dont see
anything that catches your eye
 Yes It is called
 No Courting of the Crick
 Youve bought baked goods youve bought
smut and youve played in a hotel room What do
you guys want to do now
 Youd have to ask around Make an
investigation check
 You have a hard time finding somebody who
can give you any information Most folks a couple
of individuals you stop go like Oh I dont know
about religion  and walk away
Seems to be less of an interest 
in conversing with you
 No luck on that unfortunately
 They do not It seems that theyre not
providing anything simply to read Youd probably
have to bring in your own or purchase them from
the local Chastitys Nook
 You guys meet up back at The Leaky Tap with
the rest of your party You have already retrieved
your freshly transposed enchantment on your
breastplate You guys gather once again in the
tavern to consolidate your plans for the day
 At this point its early afternoon Is
there anything you wish to do with your day Any
place you wish to go Anybody you wish to talk to
What do you want to do
 Do you guys hang around until hes ready
 Sure Do you guys want to make separate
investigation checks or does one of you want to
help the other
 So you get advantage on your investigation
check
 You spend a while looking around the back of
the tavern There is a back entrance that leads
into the kitchen There is a cellar entrance
Youre not sure if it goes to the same place where
you met or a separate subterranean space but it
is currently locked off chained
 No you guys are on your own at the moment
 So youre going to go ahead and pry the
chain off of it
 Yeah its a chain and a lock
 You get led outside in the soft drizzled
exterior into the alleyway feet clomping through
the muddy floor They show you to the outside of
an angled door that leads to a basement cellar
that is currently chained with a lock in the
center of it
 Perception check from each of you guys and
make a check with your thieves tools
 Pretty bent
 Which is good because your thieves tools
currently are not very good Youre down one set
You can try again You dont see anybody currently
heading down or near the alley at the moment
 No There arent any windows in the back of
the building since there are small vents for
kitchen smoke to filter out but theres no
windows looking out into the alley
 You add your proficiency bonus and your
dexterity
 
 The lock comes straight off
 Pull the lock of the chains open the
cellar and look down Its dark Theres no light
source in there
 You head down It is a second cellar It is
not the same cellar you guys have met with before
 No this one can only be reached from the
exterior
 Make an investigation check
 You have
 You have disadvantage on this because there
is no light source
 Because theres no light in there So even
though you have darkvision its still dim light
 You dont see any other passageways No
hidden doors or anything In fact this ones
fairly empty Theres a few barrels in here and
some small crates but a lot has been moved out of
here either because it was recently used or it
hasnt been restocked
 Go for it You find not a bottle of wine
but you find a couple of heavy jugs of some sort
of an older ale
  Okay you glance around you find a few
odd copper pieces that are in the dust You do
find a set of metal bracelets
 No Theyre separate But you do see theyre
currently resting around a skeletal wrist
 It is a human size skeleton Its been here
for a long time
 Thats the only one you find
 Not at the moment no
 So you get a torch situated It lights up
the rooms brighter
 Okay
 No more dead bodies Even this one you find
is mostly like it was stuffed behind some of the
barrels
 You can make a medicine check
 No idea
 Its just a skeleton
 There is some elements of cloth on there but
its been down here long enough to decompose to a
mostly skeletal state So it was probably here a
long time ago and it was pressed up into this
corner and barrels were pushed up against it to
keep it out of sight Probably the reason it
hasnt been found until now
 No
 Okay Its somewhat cloudy when you shake
it but still full
 Okay cool
Well Were going to have to have a good I dont
know a good chain of eyes out as were down there
tonight
 We still have a few hours until sundown Do
you guys want to wait until the evening comes
about You can
 So as you guys rest the evenings light

we have our winner of the evening it is Areski
Congratulations
 Areski
 ARESKI  congratulations Well get
that to you ASAP As you have taken the afternoon
to rest within The Leaky Tap tavern and the
midnight meeting looming what would you guys if
anything you want to do anything or do you want
to wait until the time transpires
 You guys spend the remainder of the evening
waiting for this to transpire some patrons come
in some leave Youre reading through the book
 It is actually
 It deals with the union of halforc and the
daughter of a traveling merchant as they meet on
the Amber Road up near Druvenlode It goes into a
saucy union between the two but they cant
because what would the parents think Yeah
 Uh
 Oskar With a K Oskar
 Oh man Beau as youre reading through the
book its interesting It begins to talk about
the conflict between the Julous Dominion and the
Dwendalian Empire
 Yes the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian
Empire Youre uncertain Make a history check
 It begins to name generals and figures
caught in this political conflict in the center
Remembering back to your studies these names
dont ring a bell Either theyre obscure or
fictional for the purposes of the story However
it does speak of a Crick assassin that had snuck
its way past the borders during the conflict and
had attempted to take the life of a general named Theo
  Rudy
 Blame lots of Cosbys for that one Sorry
The failed assassination attempt led to the
capture of the assassin during essentially a
test of wits between the general and this assassin
 Kind of yeah The assassins been captured
removes the helmet and behind is revealed to be
 The assassins helmet was removed by the
general after being caught
 Its not very good smut at least at this
point
 Yes Were getting there
 The assassin is revealed to be from the Kryn
Empire of Xhorhas with dark bluepurple skin
graywhite hair and pointed ears of elvish
lineage
 She is Its a female dark elf The armor is
described to be chitinous almost organic in its
design though metal You learn a little bit It
goes into a discussion of the term Crick The
term Crick is actually a slur against the people
that come from the Xhorhasian side of Wildemount
Its short for cricket because supposedly when the
Kryn armies charge into battle there are designed
holes and tubes in the armor that sounds like a
flock of crickets rushing into battle
 No its not a detailed historical book
 There we go
 As the evening clocks in close to midnight
and the majority of the patrons begin to dwindle
and scatter into the night air you watch as Ulog
enters quietly gives a nod of knowing towards the
two of you then on his own steps down into the
cellar About ten minutes or so later you watch
as Kara the halfelf girl you had met before
enters gives you a glance but doesnt
acknowledge anything orders a drink leans
against the wall then eventually disappears down
into the cellar as well Later on you watch as
Dolan the human you had spoke with that seemed
to be the one spearheading this meeting before
enters with another human male They both look
back and forth acknowledge you guys The two of
them eventually splinter off to different sides of
the room waiting One and a few minutes later
the other down into the cellar area
 No
 Make a perception check
  Hard to tell at this distance You
didnt see any visible or apparent scars or
anything that gave you a sense of shiftiness
other than the careful demeanor It didnt look to
be a face of a rugged soldier by any means
 Make an insight check
 Seems nervous but not in a way that
triggers your spidersense so to speak
  total You get no bead on the wild words
that are coming out of her mouth
 Who all is going down Its you three
 So you guys keep watch
As you descend into the cellar below you
can see theres a table already set up with a few
chairs around There are two oil lamps that are
turned low and the four figures you saw enter are
all sitting around waiting As you begin to
descend they give a knowing nod and gesture to
please take a seat
 Just the four of them
 As you enter Dolan the one who was leading
before sits up and goes Im sorry what um
 They look to each other Have a seat
 They glance about Dolan Thrym
 This is Horris Thrym my partner The man
you saw enter earlier
 Yes You know Kara and Ulog What was your
name again you said
 Caleb Thank you very much for meeting us
 Just the four of them
Ulog has been and please take no offense were
just very careful keeping a very close eye on
your activities since we last met Bit of a scare
as you entered the Kings Hall but Ive heard
that youve done a bit of business unrelated He
speaks to your skill and we may have He looks
nervously over and Horris leans forward and goes
We put two months into planning something and it
requires certain skill sets Ulog if youd like
to elaborate on this The dwarf leans forward
pulls one of the lanterns closer so all your
faces brighten up just a bit He turns the wick up
a bit So weve intercepted some documents to
Lord Sutan one of the pretty faces and money
grabbers over there in the TriSpire Very
politically connected Apparently hes been doing
some business with a lowlife whos known in the
more crownbased circles as one of those
arrestonsight types We believe this individual
might be involved with The Myriad
 We tried to bring this information 
to the Lawmaster Orentha
as she is a friend of Dolans However we were
intercepted by the HighRichter Prucine Shes
about as corrupt as you get in the structure here
in Zadash She intercepted it so that she
delivered the information Ive heard nothing
since A couple of our members have been closely
watched by the Crownsguard ever since So we
believe the HighRichter might be in on it Weve
decided if we can somehow turn Lord Sutan against
the HighRichter and then expose them to the
Lawmaster theyll either be arrested or ousted
from their positions Which one would be victory
for those who dont want to live under the claws
of corruption in this city And two vacates the
position of HighRichter While Horris practice
may have been irrevocably damaged in the public
eye Dolan is a respected member of the society
here The locals at least We believe that if not
the HighRichter himself perhaps another position
as things shift It would behoove us Dolan puts
his hand up and says It would be helpful to have
at least one of us with an ear on the bead of the
inner circle of how law is distributed within
Zadash While it is not my bailiwick people seem
to trust me and I think thats the most important
thing when taking an office Weve outlined a
means of doing so This is where we may need your
help Looks over to Kara and the halfelf leans
forward All right then so the current plan is
to infiltrate the Lord Sutans estate in the
TriSpire steal a copy of his wax seal and his
handwriting After we forge a little of the
correspondence to this unsavory individual who he
was speaking to in this letter we make a new one
that writes about an assassination of the
HighRichter sealed and signed by the Lord
Sutan Then we infiltrate the home of the
HighRichter tear apart her living space look
like its been tousled and tossed like someone
was seeking her while she was out for the night
at a local ball which shell be one night from
here Before she returns to find her place
destroyed we take this letter that we found and
left it hidden within her room She finds the
letter brings it to the Lawmaster At this
point Ulog pipes in real fast Sorry
misunderstood She doesnt get the letter We
deliver it ourselves to the Lawmaster I dont
trust her to take it
 You get the sense that theyre not the most
organized or experienced at this but theyre
trying their hand at doing something that changes
hopefully the status quo theyre used to So we
deliver the letter to the HighRichter or the
Lawmaster I prefer the HighRichter in front of
the Lawmaster if we can get the two in the same
room so theres no escape We see her
angerinfused then they begin to create turmoil
Then we expose them both have them dropped or
arrested leaving the vacant spot and theyre
out
 Wait from who Dolan puts his hand up and
says Im sorry reiterate that
 What do you suggest then
 No Dolan is to be elevated Horris is
taking a back seat
 I was a physician
 We had a practice together One of us had
to take the fall I accepted it myself Dolan
couldnt Dolan has too much at stake
 Well the systems too big for us to
deconstruct from the outside At the very least I
can hope to improve it from the inside I know the
Lawmaster is a good woman There are good people
in there But if we can root out the cancers the
tumors that threaten to make it what it is and
what it could become thats something We have to
try
 She And yes She has been responsible
Ulog at this point you can see his fingers
gritting into the table Shes the one who put my
wife in that blasted prison
 We have been discussing that If you have
any suggestions please
 Like
 They dont to my knowledge know of the
group Just some of the individuals
 Well there is Themond but hes left and
has not gone to a meeting since hes started to be
followed He was the one who delivered the letter
to the HighRichter It was mainly nothing
directly related to our meetings and more just the
delivery of our intercepted letter
 Not It wasnt something we chose it just
emerged from our meetings
 They all look to each other and back
Theres a little bit of a smile curls across
Horris face He nods I think this is a pretty
sound step in the right direction
 Do we leave evidence of correspondence in
the home of the HighRichter then
 No Weve been very careful not to do that
We could fabricate some
 Dolan pipes up Im worried about turning
in evidence because theres nothing that could
connect it to the spot However if we could plant
evidence in the estate of the HighRichter and
convince the Lawmaster I believe if we speak to
her she would at least do an investigation
Theyd find this evidence in the home in the
right place That could be enough
 The Lawmaster works above the
HighRichter
 You hear a  as Ulog has pulled
the cork of a small bottle of ale that was sitting
there for a while and begins to drink
 Honestly more of a thinker Ulog
however She points to the dwarf again who has
finished drinking Yeah I used to run with some
pretty shifty lot Done a bit of burglary in my past
 Were not nervous about the Myriad other
than the fact that the Myriads a bunch of
fuckheads that steal enslave and push all sorts
of unsavory business Theyre the mirror side to
the bullshit the Empire does For all that we
want to make sure that if we can connect any of
them to the Myriad and Lord Sutan is definitely
to plant evidence in two
 Dolan sits back Its a good point Any
recommendations
 He thinks for a moment Through his
paperwork
 Shut up
 How about The Song and Supper Inn
 Its on the west side of the Interstead
Sprawl
 Maybe  minutes on foot
 They all look at each other Kara leans
forward Lets say The Inquiry
 Thank you I appreciate that
 Dolan nods and smiles Looks to Horris
looks to the other two Thank you Weve been
needing more than just angry voices of
halfenthused common folk People of action are
hard to find that seem to have a trusted heart
 Dolans stare goes a little distant as he
tries to fully comprehend the gravity of your
statement before slowly nodding
 I will
 I will take that into consideration Thank
you
 I appreciate that And you I guess as we
begin to put this together what are your
specialties
 Good Very well then tomorrow afternoon
The Song  Supper
 Ulog leans forward a bit and goes After
you
 Make a perception check
 No strange behavior there doesnt seem to
be any business or activity towards the back or
the alley Nothing that catches your eye to be
suspicious or encroaching upon the meeting below
 You all regather in the center of The Leaky
Tap tavern
 At this point you see Ulog make his way up
and take a different table at the far corner Then
slowly over the next  or so minutes the other
three exit the building
 Make a stealth check please
 Which one are you following Theres the
half elf
 Theres two human men and then there is the
dwarf male
 They are You follow them for the next  or
so minutes before they come to a modest home Its
in a little bit of disrepair especially in the
recent the recent storm part of the roof is
sinking inward a little bit They enter close and
lock the door behind them They glance through the
window and they have a heated conversation back
and forth If you want to listen then make a
perception check
 Its going to be a thing forever
 Its hard to hear Its muffled the walls
thick Its not an argument more of a lot of
passionate conversation back and forth some
aggressive counter points to some sort of
conversation Eventually they both settle down
with a bottle of wine and you glance through the
window You see the one with the blond hair is
sobbing into his arms at a table and
 Theyre both men The other one has his arm
around the other and consoles him Looking inside
you see its a lot of books across the wall you
recognize there are some alchemical vials or other
things that similartype glass containers that can
be utilized for that Some dried roots are hanging
from the wall A lot of them appear to be
medicinal in nature After about  minutes or so
of watching this nothing strange catches your
eye It seems like two people winding down after a
stressful day
 Make a perception roll for Frumpkin
 Oh my god it does
 Its too hard to see from the outside You
can barely tell there are books there The very
low light there is inside you cant make out any
details
 Single level house it might be two rooms
No its not quite like impoverished but its
not
 You do see a heavy crook of some kind like
a staff with a big heavy wooden knot at the end
It can be used to defend oneself and also as a
walking stick A shillelagh if you will You can
see a general shortsword that is put on a belt
that is hung on a wall but nothing in there that
is militarized
 Immediately inside you hear some rustling
and all the lights inside go out and it goes dark
You run away
 It lasts for an hour Its probably run out
by now
 At this point hes probably left Its been
about an hour since you returned
 You did
 It is about 
 
 in the morning
though
 You guys met around midnight So you can go
try and wake up Claudia if youd like
 Not at the moment
 Wessek is there Wessek is sitting back
its a very slow night
 Hello little blue girl what can I do for
you
 It is very late and Im sort of wondering
what youre bothering me with this late Im
curious
 Sorry I dont
 I couldnt tell you The HighRichter is
pretty well pretty high up there
 Most likely or at least somewhere where
its official Its my guess
 Goodbye
 So both of you guys go and hide Stealth
check from both of you
 You have a passive perception of
 No passive perception I believe for you
is
 As you all go to bed what are you doing
 You guys go to sleep
 You havent finished it yet but a little
over halfway
 Okay you go read it Nott what are you
doing
 No
 Its empty its dark except for you see
this Actually make a Let me check one thing
on this Just to see how this works in this
circumstance
 Make an investigation check
 There you see a shining bag of glittering
coin and buttons spilling out of the top of this
small satchel
 Yes you do
 You can go ahead and make an insight check
 I need you to make a wisdom saving throw
 You are charmed by Mollymauk
 Meaning youre very friendly and amiable
and take his advice and suggestions like a very
dear friend
 Okay
 Oh man Make an acrobatics check
  Thats enough As youre darting
through you see the foot go out and you leap
tumble roll and make your way into the hallway
and escape back to your chambers
 You guys all eventually find yourselves to
rest for the evening awaking in the early
morning The chilled morning air comes through
that poke through No rain its still a little
chilled Theres a bit of fog burning off by the
time you awaken and look out your rooms window
The morning is yours what do you wish to do
 All righty The rest of you gather
 You have your morning breakfast
 More reinforcing more of what was there
Because a lot of the information about Xhorhasian
society is still largely unknown or uncatalogued
you get the sense the more you read and the more
the perspectives of this assassins left across
the way youre uncertain as to how accurate any
of it is but it talks of a torturous society of
bloodshed and beasts a I got an eyelash in my
eye thats great
 There we go Okay were good Talking of
this terrible life of endless wastes of
carnivorous and cannibalistic creatures and that
the Crick nation being this terrible place of
perpetual inner turmoil and vying for the next
position of power The assassin that falls into
this relationship falls into it as perspective of
being saved of being taken from this terrible
place and brought into the good graces of this
General and brought into the comforting realm of
the Empire However upon being discovered ends
up being captured tried and killed The last
part of the book deals with the General going
through his own grief and the process but also
understanding it never could be and was probably
for the best Youre left with a unsatisfied meh
feeling at the end of it all
 Kind of
 You know that the HighRichter is the
associate judge to the Lawmaster The Lawmaster
oversees very high profile judgments and then
anything that falls below anything highprofile
 Circuit judge is what the HighRichter is
Things go through the HighRichter first before
they go to the Lawmaster They gauge what is
important enough for the Lawmaster and what
remains in their circle which is why you can see
the frustration with anything that they try to
bring forth that may have been incriminating to an
ally of the HighRichter could be easily caught in
that net and not brought upward
 The order ledger or you mean the letter
 Right youre not talking about the letter
from Baumbauch from the Gentleman right
 Yes there is
 The Timalt Store House
 Correct
 Timalts are in Zadash
 Its midmorning 

 
 am
 Yeah you can do that
 The writ was retrieved
 Mmkay so you guys make your way back to the
same sewer entrance where you originally embarked
below There are two crownsguard in the vicinity
theyre keeping watch of that intersection just
like they were last time They havent noticed
your approach yet but they are keeping an eye
 Okay
 Make a stealth check
 All righty
 As you hide off on the side you focus and
then concentrate on one of the two crownsguard As
the magic begins to slowly filter around the
outside of the face the brief little motes of
shadow begin to be plucked from the space and
gather around the outside of its head
Unknowingly whats your spell DC Thats a ten
Its higher than ten Im pretty sure
 All of a sudden the guard  and
you watch as these motes fit faintly around the
outside like this floating crown on the top of
the head You force him to attack the other
 The guard  grabs his blade runs
forward The other guard is like Hey what
oh  Pulls his shield up Whats going
on David what the fuck are you doing
 Its going to make another save Its a two
its still holding
 The gate It is locked
 Everyones attention right now is directly
on this as one crownsguard is attacking the other
 Its plus six
 Nine Its not coming off its not
opening
 He attacks the other guard hes screaming
Get help No its an  Whats your spell DC
 Make a strength check Roll a d add your
strength modifier
  You actually break it with your bare
hands leaving an opening
 Theres a scream starting to happen you
guys start running in one after another Guard
gets one more saving throw  whats your
  Shit The other guard is now wrestling
him to the ground and hes trying to hold him to
the ground What the fuck You hear screams
going off around now this ruckus is gathering in
the center as people are starting to yell You can
hear in the distance other crownsguard yelling and
starting to gather in the middle of this chaos as
you all get down in the sewer and pull it shut
 You hear all the ruckus up there echoing
down inside and other footsteps coming through and
you hear this guy going I am so sorry I dont
know what was happening Ow that hurts I dont
know whats and you hear hes being held to the
ground now and people are shouting and oh man
 That guys going to have a bad day
 Go ahead and make a stealth check guys
All of you guys make a stealth check
 Okay At a mass majority you do slip around
the same area where you had the original
confrontation you do see some more of those rats
scattered about but you manage to quickly dart
by In a few moments you hear a  turn as
they notice something but they go in the
direction as you go in to move past Some of them
shift in where you were but no longer where you
are The blind rats are going by the sound and
being misled a bit so you manage to maneuver
around without any immediate conflict Eventually
you make your way back to where those webs were
situated before the phase spiders little domain
there at the edge Still in tatters untouched from
where you left it You head back to the rung and
you can see the entranceway into the TriSpire District
 Perfect
 Youre like the pallbearer to the undertaker
of Fjord
 Thank you Anybody else making any effort or
are you just doing your thing
 Okay
 Perfect This is great
 The moment you climb up the top did you
leave it locked Did you lock it behind you as
you
 I think you left it unlocked It wouldnt
have been a huge issue Youre not in danger
Well say you left it unlocked because you
intended to possibly use it again in the future
You head back push the two pipes and you all
climb back into the alleyway You are now in the
TriSpire district
 Walking around the city you see a few
crownsguard wandering the streets they
occasionally put a glance to not recognize you
wandering but dont pay immediate attention You
do see one gentleman early s or so whos
wearing this nice frilled shirt with heavy brass
buttons down the front with this potbelly thats
tucked in with a belt breeches that go past the
knee before his boots hit and hes walking in the
street strutting a bit looking up Hes the
first person you see that crosses your path that
looks like they probably know the vicinity
 Yes can I help you
 Well that is the HighRichters estate I
do not know if she is home She may be at the
Kings Hall
 Very well Lets see Dayanas estate is
right around that way He points You see that he
has this thin white John Waters mustache across
the top that turns into this light goatee right at
the tip of the chin As he points over you can
see Right on the outskirts of the Gilded
Willows that one He points again
 It was my pleasure He continues walking
on his way
 Approaching the homestead that was pointed
out by that gentleman earlier the homestead is
surrounded by a sevenfoot tall stone and mortar
wall that tightly crowds the perimeter This is
only maybe a threefoot space between the wall and
the actual home You see that the twostory home
is painted in a forest green color on the outside
of the wood and stone built structure You can see
that there is a front archway to the door that
goes beyond the wall There is a small gate
Beyond that there is the front door to the estate
where there is a stationed crownsguard
 There is actually only one crownsguard at
the front door behind the gate As you approach
arms crossed
 Make a deception check
 Glad you fixed that The guard goes Oh
I Just a second goes and opens the door
leaning inside HighRichter you have guests out
front A voice goes Tell them to wait a moment
 A moment passes The crownsguard steps out
of the way and you see emerge from the doorway an
older female halfelf with dark redpurple hair
that is short on the sides and brushed to one
side almost to a point She has a gaunt angular
appearance and is in the process of putting on
ceremonial gold and white armor similar to what
you had seen on the Herald of the Hall but a more
elaborate design and taken from the process of
buckling together a brace She walks up and goes
All right now whos here for their time with me
 I have no idea who you are
 Make a deception check
 Yes of course I recall Its been some
time What brings you to the front of my homestead
in the middle of the day Im on my way to the
Hall
 I would like both of you to make deception
checks please
 She goes Puppies Im sure Well
Baumbauch is outside of the Zadash jurisdiction
That is Trostenwald territory Im afraid that is
not something I would nor could handle if I wanted
to If you wish to bring them to justice either
present your evidence to the lawmaster of
Trostenwald or bring Baumbauch to me Otherwise
I have no interest
 Then why are you wasting my time right
now
 Am I step inside The crownsguard step
inside and close the door behind Am I to
understand that youve come out here in broad
daylight to my estate in an attempt to bribe the
HighRichter of Zadash
 So long as its not a bribe Favors we can
do
 Ill see whats possible Ill ask around
Ill take these documents if you dont mind to
see what can be mustered
 Of course There are all sides and types of
favors that can be helpful to the Crown and those
below
 I think theyre droll and must be fed to
their larger kin So are we done here
 Im certain it has been
 Well this is on the front doorstep
 No she pulled the crownsguard inside
 From the immediate front position there is
the door itself beyond the archway two small
windows to each side of it though it appears that
theyre closed and theyre bisected with wooden
beams between
 They are shuttered yeah from the inside
Youd open them from the inside to bring in the
light but theyre currently closed The second
floor above you do see one balcony Its a bit
receded and theres a balcony that looks out over
it all with a second set of doors but that is
currently closed
 Okay
 Oh I got you I follow you now
 There is an immediate bit of a scowl and I
would also ask nicely if youll stop bringing
these demon bloods onto my estate to be
ruining
 She turns around wordlessly and goes inside
and slams the door
 As you guys are having this conversation
you notice that the streets themselves have long
silken streamers that are affixed from light pole
to light pole as part of the decoration along the
streets but you see additional decorations being
put up You see bunches of flowers being affixed
to the top of these poles you can see more
streamers of multiple colors being placed around a
center courtyard in one of the midareas of the
Silken Terrace
 Right now its just being put around the
Gilded Willows which is a little ways further
away from the estate as youre heading back You
can see decorations going up tables being set it
looks to be a small platform being risen Theres
some sort of event coming up fairly soon
 Yep So you guys make your way reversing
your steps outside of the TriSpire making your
way towards the western side of the Interstead
Sprawl to the Song  Supper Inn
 There are a few yeah
 Okay you sneakily slip it into a small gap
so its visible but not liable to be blown away
Perfect
 As you guys make your way to the interior of
the inn it is lively It is the loudest
musically tavern youve seen You get the sense
both by title and by the interior that this
essentially a perpetual an open mic night for any
musicians or bards who want to come and try out
their craft There are three different bands that
are cycling through on the main raised dais to
perform The atmosphere is lively and folks come
here for that Its a poor tavern comparatively
The interior looks like a lot of the paint is
chipped and run or crinkled the smell inside is
not the best but it serves basic food basic
drinks and at least an atmosphere of music and
fun Some folks sing along and jump into a shanty
or two As you come in you can see both Ulog and
Dolan are currently sitting at a table across from
each other As they notice you guys approach they
raise a drink and you can see the rest of the
table they have ready for you guys to come and sit
 Your spells would have run out by now
 Not in the tavern no There was one
outside but patrolling the streets Not
everything is super heavily guarded in smaller
areas like this
 Make a perception check
 I mean no more than anyone looks at you
when you enter a room being a blueskinned
tiefling You dont get the sense that anyone is
casing you the entire time that youve been there
 You dont notice anybody following you in
no
 You see Dolan and Ulog are there waiting at
the table as you come and join with them Does
everybody sit with them
 You go with them to the table Dolan gives you a
look And this is one of your associates
 No Id just like to ask your name
 Tonya Pleasure Im Dolan Dolan Thrym
this is Ulog He sits there hes like Hey
They both take a very long minute and look over
you
 Im sorry Im just being careful
 I can see that
 No
 I mean only in the sense that theyre fresh
faces
 Ulog leans in hes like Ive watched them
a bit theyre all friends its fine Dolan
goes All right
 Dolan goes All right so weve been
looking for an opening weve been trying to find
out We thought it was tonight but theyve pushed
it back a day There is a preharvest gala
happening in the TriSpire tomorrow night We
figure this distraction would be enough to do any
of the quiet infiltrations that were attempting
to accomplish should you still be interested in
coming with us I know there was hesitation and I
dont want anyone to be coming into this that
doesnt feel comfortable To be honest I want to
be comfortable as well and to know that were
going to bed with the right people Are there any
concerns Any questions worries
 Right I assumed that was probably going to
be a thing Me and Horris pitched in together We
dont have much but this is too important to not
Me and Horris put together about  gold between
the two of us He puts a small thing on the
table showing it Hes not putting it out in the
open because he doesnt want to be like I have
all this money on the table Hes like We have
some Kara put in  gold of her own Ulog leans
in and goes  gold  silver  copper
Its my life savings I want to see these fuckers
burn
 Make an insight check
 Total balls Hard to read
 We wouldnt be going to the gala We would
be
 Party after
 Ulog still leaning forward goes Id like
to I have the most at stake here monetarily
Ive got skills I think will synergize well with
the ones you bring to the table Ill be coming
with you
 Dolan goes Kara her skills are more in
the interpersonal level not so much infiltration
And Im just me so I dont think Id be of much
help
 Actually yes Not many We have a few left
over Horris should have a few more
 I hope that isnt the case Just in case
all right Ill have those sent Ill send them
along with Ulog for you
 Of course
 Oh yes He pulls out a small piece of
parchment and discretely hands it to you under the
table You feel it tap your knee As you look
inside its a symbol that looks like an R but
part of the R extends beyond to produce a K
almost It looks like a sigil or seal that
utilizes the title in it
 I havent used my art degree

 I have to ask you because if were all
going in on this I have to be absolutely sure
Are you coming with us on this You can back out
Theres no shame in that but were not going to
go in this without your help as well That would
be foolish
 He stands up for a second and says Ulog
drink Sure They both get up from the table
and walk over to the bar to get another round
 Yeah You have the rest of the day the
evening and tomorrow night is apparently the
PreHarvest Gala in the TriSpire
 You see Dolan and Ulog are having their
drink at the bar They walk up and sit down So
can we count on you
 You see Ulog and Dolan share a look and nod
A smile comes across Dolans face Thank you You
wont regret it I suppose prepare whatever
youll need Well meet back in the cellar of The
Leaky Tap tomorrow at sundown and well take it
from there You can sense this excited
nervousness to his voice that wasnt there before
as he smiles
 We have a few ideas
 Til tomorrow then
 He gets up and finishes his drink and
buttons the top button of his shirt and then
makes his way out Ulog sits up goes and takes
what swills at the bottom of Dolans drink and
finishes it then finishes his drink pops it
down Til tomorrow He gets up and leaves
 Perception check
 You dont notice anybody paying attention
 The only thing you notice is that on the way
out Dolan  As he heads to the door you see
Kara the halfelf was waiting at the door As
soon as he heads over she goes So They both
exit into the main thoroughfare
 You dont know much about Lord Sutan You
havent heard his name referenced at all with any
of the
 Make a perception check
  You glance through the crowd and you
can just make out it the distance the back of
Ulog as hes walking down the street about to
turn
 As you catch up he glances over his
shoulder at the sound of the running and he goes
What
 I dont fucking know His estate Hes not
that far from where the galas happening
 He knows where he lives thats it
 Thats all supposedly in one night
 At dawn we plan And thats where well
pick up next week Building up to
 I know DD motherfucker So well see
where this takes you guys next week during the
PreHarvest Gala

 Awesome Well well pick up for the ensuing
tension next week on Thursday This weekend well
see you guys who are planning to come down to
Sunday Hopefully well see you guys there Until
then have a wonderful night and is it Thursday
yet Good night

 Hello and welcome back Last we left off
the Mighty Nein had gotten in bed with a rebel
group who had been meeting in the interior of
Zadash Unhappy with some members of the local
government of this city they had been trying to
discover a way they could discredit some of the
corrupt individuals that have been causing some
strife in this city to some of the locals You had
met some of these individuals a few times to
discover that there is an End of Harvest Gala that
was arriving fairly soon That was going to be a
distraction period to allow them to infiltrate the
Sutan and the HighRichter Prucine You discussed
with them last time a plot fixing their
notverywellputtogether plot into a better
direction thankfully
 to acquire a wax seal within the home of
Lord Sutan to create a letter that you feel would
be incriminating then to infiltrate the
HighRichters home do the same and then report
them to the lawmaster or whoever else youd think
would be of higher estate This is transpiring
tomorrow evening Where we last left off it was
later in the afternoon after your final
discussion You guys have a day to prepare however
you wish to
 Mighty Nein what would you like to do
 Orentha
 Thats the HighRichter
 Right now you guys have just finished
meeting with the other members of the Knights of
Requital in
 Song and Supper yes
 No longer
 At the job postings you had seen on the task
board outside of the Kings Hall they were
handwritten but they all had been written by the
Herald of the Hall He was the one who was
handling most of the jobs that were being
distributed Whatever information comes to him
hes the one who posts them it seems
 
 I was going to make you roll for it but no
you got this
 Its later afternoon
 Dont pull a Liam
 All right You guys make your way following
Nott who had previously trailed Dolan to the
home and you eventually find your way to the
outskirts of a very simple its a hovel but
only because its been in disuse for a while
There is a single front door it looks to be a
twochamber home with one large central main
living space and one bedroom in the back The roof
itself is made of heavily pressedtogether thatch
and stick As soon as you approach you can see
that the front door is closed and you see a
little bit of movement through the window someone
walking around
 From what you saw yeah
 Yeah two buildings over you look off to
the side and theres a small alcove of shade where
you could probably pop in quickly and dispense a
spell without it causing any ruckus
 The same figure you brought to the
HighRichters
 All right
 Okay
 Doesnt take a spell slot
 All right Knock on the door
 All right As you knock on the door theres
a pause and you see out of the corner of the
window the edge of a face peek out there and
then disappear behind and a voice goes Who is it
 You hear some rustling some unlocking
process and the door opens up and you can see
Horris opens the door and Dolans behind Yes
please come in Looks just past you as you enter
the building and they close the door behind you
 Its just the two of them at the moment
 Okay They both pause for a second Oh
wow all right you are as skilled as they say it
seems Thats pretty useful
 Oh right His abode he lives in the
Gilded Willows in the TriSpires
 Hes I would say not too terribly far
from the Skyscape Park and where the Constellation
Bridge tower stands Its a threestory house
dark wood gold leaf carving Its a bit gaudy
hard to miss amongst some of the other ones there
although all of them are gaudy in their own right
Look for the threestory irongated dark
greenwood building in that vicinity
 Unfortunately no most lords are very
careful with documentation transfer back and
forth they usually go through direct parcel
services
 Oh no  Nothing that was
directly from his hand at least They usually go
through intermediaries for that purpose
 I mean that would be the one that replaced
us And he nudges over to Horris on the side
That would be I had that written down
Somewhere in here Oh shit its my older notes
 Exactly
 I believe its Ren Sutan
 Yes If not the Internet will correct
me
 Oh no Lord Diedric Sutan is his name
Ren
 Ren is his son who he placed to destroy and
take over our practice
 You hear Horris off to the side arms
crossed now hearing all this goes Yeah you
could say that
 They both look at each other and you watch
as Dolan glances out the window Not that far
outside of the Apple Tree Tutorship vicinity you
will find a white and peach building with a few
banners in the front and thats Rens new
practice
 Yes
 I mean sure He looks confused

 Dark physicianry I guess is an issue in
some parts of the world I suppose
 He looks back at Horris Horris is like
Right Well if you come across any dark
physicianry please do your best to quell it where
it seeds

 Thank you
 Youre not there
 No worries I suppose since Tomorrow
evening when everythings set to go me and
Horris Kara were not going to be present when
all of this goes down so we have deniability when
we turn our information in for this whole
endeavor but I think Ulog and you guys should
meet on the outside of the tavern that we met at
earlier today to kick this off
 You got it
 Well good luck and
 All right Locks the door
 The eye peeks through the window once
again
 
 No that would make this a lot easier
 Sorry
 You too 
 Constellation Bridge tower and Skyscape
Park
 You got maybe an hour and half to two hours
before sunset
 You both make your way toward the TriSpire
As you make your way towards the front entry gates
there one of the guards posted there is familiar
with you and begins to let you through As you approach
 As you pass through a few steps behind
Jester the guard approaches Halt I dont
believe Ive seen you through here before
 Very well
 Steps back You guys make your way
following the directions to the Gilded Willows
You see the massive treetops that fill out the
skyline from your perspective Every home seems to
have a row of greenery between Its a very very
beautiful neighborhood You can follow where the
Constellation Bridge Tower as a beacon and as it
guides you towards its area it doesnt take long
for you to see the large gaudy threestory
complex that is Lord Sutans home You can see the
gold leaf carving along the edges of each of the
various stories in between The dark green slats
that are there are coated in some sort of a
lacquer material that almost glistens in the
sunlight as it passes The sunset colors now
starting to make their way into the cloudcovered
sky You do see marble pillars at the corner of
the estates grounds With iron gates that link
each of them with about maybe five foot bit of
simple lawnhill that separates the gap between
the gate and the building itself
 Well the gates on all them are solid except
for in the very front and the very back Both of
them appear to be closed and locked You do see
posted at the front of the front door there are
two crownsguard that are there keeping watch On
the back end as you case around to the rear side
of the home there is a singular crownsguard and a
dog that is on a chain
 Make a perception check
 Its hard to see where any perspective would
be a blind spot For entry other than above or
from the sides because the front and back seem
pretty well covered by these guards as theyre
currently posted and standing there So the only
things that really make sense would be either
flanking the building or something that guides you
over top Thats all you can think of
 The one that is immediately to the left of
it is twostory its a shorter building There is
a tree to the immediate right of it that rises up
to about the height if not a little taller than
the actual home itself The building next to it is
another two stories This one lords over the other
buildings but there is one large tree that is
about five feet from the edge of the wall
 Its five feet to the wall and then about
five feet from the wall to the actual building So
its a ten foot from the tree to the roof
 You could certainly try
 The gates about eight feet tall and the
building is three stories So I mean there are
some roofedge perches the stories kinda taper
with each additional floor So there is a small
space maybe a foot a foot and a half wide that
you could shoot for If there was something you
wanted to try but
 There are no windows on the base floor or
at least none that you can see The second floor
you do see one set of double windows that open
Though they are currently closed Those are on the
two side edges of the building
 No Theres no balcony
 The only balcony you saw was in the large
balcony at the front of the HighRichters home
but not on this one
 As you glance at the back of the building
the doors that you see immediately there is one
set of doors that is the front with the two guards
are The back where the other gate entrance is
there isnt another door that leads into the home
There is a doublecellar door that descends
beneath That is what is currently being guarded
with a man and the dog
 Do you have a climbers kit
 The new DD nightmare mode
 Youre all level one bards with nothing but
ball bearings go
 Unfortunately
 Well the wall is an iron gate Theyre all
long iron fencing gate There are the marble
pillars at the corner of each one So its open
its a series of bars
 They are They are poodle impalers
 Do you want to try it
 Okay
 Okay as you place your hand through the
bar
 Nothing happens
 No its fine
 Game over
 Youre not there
 Shh
 Thats true youre right Sam
  Bonus action 

 Can we please make the metagaming pigeon a
thing now Ive played with a few in my time

 All right Anything else you guys want to do
while youre there
 Okay Do you guys want and try for a
climbers kit on your way back
 Okay It takes a little bit of time to find
a place because some of the shops are starting to
close past sunset The time it took you guys to
get there do a full casing and come back the sun
has set and the sky is getting darker However
thankfully a climbers kit is not all that
expensive With a full cost on that come on
Climbers kit ha I was wrong  gold
 Just the grappling hook
 Two gold
  Right can I get a consultation
first
  Ah climbers kit includes a lot of things
 Includes special pitons boot tips gloves and a
harness Thats for mountain climbing
 Yeah
 Some nice core balls you can sit on Yeah
so you want a grappling hook and rope You can get
those Those are cheaper
 Grappling hook is two gold and the rope
you want silk or hempen
 That would be hempen so thats one gold
 So three gold for a single grappling rope
and rope
 So mark down that you have a grappling hook
and  feet of hempen rope
 All right As you guys are accomplishing
that the rest of you
 The rest of you what are you doing
  The Tutoring Village
 Make an investigation check
 Twelve okay It takes you a little while to
get there You havent actually been to the Tutor
Village before
 Okay same difference So you manage
through asking questions and finding your way
around you manage to get to the Tutor Village
right around sunset You do see about one block
over the large whitepeach building that you had
previously been told by Dolan You see the sign
up its called the Guided Hand Infirmary Its
one story but it stretches wide towards the back
Its like a large shotgun building
 The Guided Hand Infirmary You can see light
from the interior There are two windows at the
front and a row of windows as it continues down
the back of the alley The alley you can see
actually lights up because the bright interior
warm light reflecting off of the buildings on the
opposite side down the alley on each parallel end
of it The building itself seems fairly well made
theres elements of a plaster material put against
the wood to make it seem a little less cracked and
broken on the vicinity around it It looks like a
little more money went into this complex than a
lot of the surrounding buildings
 As Frumpkin curls up and jumps onto the
windowsill and you glance through the vision of
your familiar The first window you come across
inside its a simple room its painted a similar
white peach color Theres a single bed maybe
twin size with a single sheet You see an
individual who is currently lying on it with not
quite Caleb dirty clothes but not an
upperclassman by any means Upperclassman Not
what I was going for thats fine
 Wooo Sydney football rules Weird But you
do see this individual is currently has a full arm
bandaged with blood soaked and dried on parts of
it and they are currently asleep and the door is
closed There is a lantern inside that is set to
keep the room warm
 Yeah have him move around go around the
front
 As Frumpkin keeps watch on each of these
each chamber seems to either be empty or theres
somebody in some state of either rest or waiting
You see one person a younger girl maybe fifteen
or sixteen years old who is waiting on the edge
of a bed sitting quietly in a room by herself
Glancing around she looks over and sees Frumpkin
and goes Kitty and makes the hand motion to
try and pet You go around the back door and you
can see one room has two beds that currently have
two individuals that are coughing heavily Theyre
sick with something pretty bad and there is a
person inside that is dressed in a white robe that
is in the process of bringing them both broth but
they have a mask over their face a piece of cloth
tied behind and it looks like theyre treating
some diseased patients This is for all intents
and purposes an infirmary
 Its a one story building but its quite
long It goes back quite a bit Other buildings
are spotty and build the space around the outside
of this block whereas this infirmary stretches
the entire length of the block
 Correct it looks like all It looks like
its built so that all the rooms that have
sunlight are the rooms where the patients would
stay Anything important would be kept in the
interior of the building
 The roof is about Id say  feet up
 As youre focusing Fjord you notice a small
child maybe five or six years old this scruffy
reddish hair and a dirty smashed face walks up
and goes What happened to the kitty
 I was going up to pet it and it went
away
 Oh Im Simon
 Hes a real boy

 Okay He runs around the other side of the
building Frumpkin is on top And looking at the
top the front of it looks really nice The top
which nobody sees doesnt look that great Its a
pretty shoddy wooden slats over wooden slats
across the entirety of the roof complex You can
see one small trap door about the center of it
that is currently closed
 
 At which point you hear a kid go Whoa
Simon is now on the side staring at this
disappearing and reappearing cat
 Make a persuasion check
   and he runs
 It would take you about an hour or so to do
so To a studied physician probably not going to
hold up
 You can certainly try Depending upon how
high you roll
 About an hour
 Youre going to spend time and apply
 In the street
 Thats up to you you can try and duck into
a shady corner And spend an hour
 You can get yourself some evening scrambled
eggs for five copper
 All right If youre gathering all those
materials from a scattered meal
 Well put it at about eight copper for the
total
 Okay Im going to say for this go ahead
and roll a d Add your proficiency bonus and
intelligence modifier
 Yeah Because this is about trying to come
up with an accurate means of looking like youve
been infected with something
  Okay You take an hour and youre pretty
proud of it You think itll work fine
 For a month
 Theres alleys on each side but they both
have windows that are lit so you would be in one
of those vicinities
 You could You would be at a distance
though
 All right So the two of you enter You go
through the front door Its a double door It
pushes open It doesnt appear to have resistance
its on a hinge You push in and at the front
theres a clerk there wearing the same white
hair big bulbous red nose some pockmarking on
his cheek He looks up Can I help you
 He reaches down and pulls a cloth up and
puts it immediately over his face Okay um 
 Okay As youre doing that I need you to
roll a deception check with advantage because
youre helping
  As soon as you spray in the face hes
like  Takes the scarf off and
 Sit down please He points over to a
bench on the side
 Take a point of damage
 The clerk at this point goes Please Stay
tight Im going to shit He leaves the room
 You walk in as you see theres a spray of
stuff across the clerks counter You see both
Mollymauk and Fjord crawling in opposite
directions across the floor as you hear footsteps
and the clerk had just rushed out of the chamber
down the hallway
 What you see now is theres two hallways
Theres one to each side as you enter Where the
clerks desk was it looks like theres all the
rooms you saw on the right side all the rooms you
saw on the left side and there are chambers in
the center of the building with the two hallways
that bisect the two areas You can choose right or
left its up to you The clerk went down the
right side
 Okay As youre rushing with Nott in your
arms you head into the hallway on the left side
and you glance and can immediately see another
person with a robe who is holding a small satchel
of some sort of greenish material They walk and
see you Excuse me can I help you
 Make a deception check please
 What seems to be the problem He looks as
opposed to being empathically interested in your
wellbeing is genuinely disturbed by the sound
the child is making Rosemarys Baby style
 Roll an attack for Frumpkin please
 That hits hes wearing a robe Go ahead and
roll
 Well say its one point of damage is a
cats scratch As its clawing hes 
He starts screaming and grabs Frumpkin on his back
and tries to pull him and throw him off Frumpkin
fullon spins scatters all claws and legs out
lands on the ground  Full
puffup tail and everything At this point you
watch another doorway flip open and you see a man
come out with very short brown hair on the sides
with a pompadour in the front and a similar white
robe but it looks like its longersleeved with
more detail He goes What is all this ruckus happening
 What is a cat doing here Get the cat He
watches as the clerk says I dont  shoo Shoo
Shoo Hes trying to get Frumpkin to leave now
 Theres now other workers of the infirmary
coming out of the rooms that are all starting to
gather The one who saw you in the hallway is now
coming towards you while shooing Frumpkin out You
watch the guy who had left the chamber head back
into the office and close it People are starting
to scatter You guys are waiting in the two rooms
now you said You found two separate rooms
 Youre just running the hall
 What are you doing
 So youre coughing loud in the room Youre
crawling in the hall Behind them
 Well find out in a second Now we have you
spitting and freaking out The two clerks that are
trying to push Frumpkin out are trying to escort
you They see you Theyre like Sir Sir They
start grabbing your arms and lifting you up
 They start dragging you into one of the
rooms on the side They open one room and theres
somebody in there already who was sleeping but is
starting to come to going Whats happening
Sorry They close the door go to the next
chamber and start dragging you into an empty room
 Okay
 All right They open the door
 You bolt
 Make an athletics check
 Actually this would be your choice
 You try and pull away but in the moment
theyre genuinely worried about your wellbeing
Theyve probably had patients try and make big
physical actions while theyre in their care and
they hold you back
 Devils Tongue or Vicious Mockery
 Okay Thats  Whats your DC on it
 Whats your charisma modifier
 Its fine They succeed You shout this and
one of them  They grab and throw you into
the room You  into the chamber and they
close the door pushing you inside of it
 Well whats the DC of the spell is what Im
asking
 Thats okay
 Its fine They shove you into the chamber
They close the door You land on the ground and
you hear it lock behind you
 You are now a dangerous patient who needs
other glancing While thats happening and theyre
distracted by that you guys
 Id say about half of them are full You see
two chambers that are empty
 All right You close the door You guys both
make stealth checks real fast
 All right You enter the room and close it
What are you doing
  Hello Is there somebody in
here
 The door opens and you see that theres a
clerk who had apparently heard the door close
behind you as you had entered the room and is now
walking into this darkened chamber As soon as the
door opens you guys are on the opposite side of
the door He walks over towards the lantern in the
corner to light it because the room is dark that
youre in Theres nobody in there at the moment
He walks over
 Oh wait Wait You guys bolt past into
the hallway You guys dart out to the entrance and
out into the night air
 Oh just out of the room You guys are out
of the room and the person sees you
 Well you guys find Fjord there coughing
loudly while you are currently locked in this room
 There is
 Yeah Well no Theres a door its a
closed solid door and theres a window looking outside
 Theres not No There is one cross bar that
is maintained its more to support the four panes
of glass but thats it
 Peek out the door
 Sorry theres no window in the door
 Okay While youre meditating on that
 Fjord is alone in the room
 There are two clerks now that were
originally fleeing to get help and have come back
now with the gentleman with the short brown hair
whos exited the opposite side of the chamber now
Weve brought the doctor He moves before the
doctor who approaches All right so you appear
to be sick
 Make a deception check
 Yes
  He goes All right Please have a seat
in this chamber
 Theres an outhouse about two blocks down
outside Come back  
 Get in the room Well get you a pan
 You go in the room and one of them pulls
out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side
 They close the door immediately and then
Whats your problem
 Let me see her He comes forward and puts
his hands out towards Nott
 Do you do that Make an intimidation check
with advantage
  The physician goes  falls
back The other two clerks or physician helpers
 Make an acrobatics check to try and dodge
past their grasp as you begin to dart through their
 As you run all of a sudden theres a tug on
your cloak and the same younger physician who had
told you to get out is clutching the back of your
cloak and lifts you up off the ground Well then
someones going to play nice with the
Crownsguard and turns and starts bringing you
towards the exit You too outside
 Yes
 Yeah easily
 Yeah
 You exit out and the two other ones are
looking a bit confused Hes currently dragging
Nott whos flailing on the edge of the cloak
dangling out into the main area
 Okay He goes and throws you out onto the
street Pushes you out Caleb and goes Guard
and begins pointing loudly over there down in the
direction of where you tumbled and landed on the ground
 You guys got shoved out into the front of
the facility Nott got tossed landed and
stumbled a few feet and theyre now shouting for
the guard and pointing at Nott
 You guys start bolting
 As you guys run they dont give chase
because its not their job to do so but they
start shouting and shouting I want you both to
roll stealth checks to try and see if you can
avoid the sight of the Crownsguard that are in the
process of responding to the shout
 Okay As you guys dart into the nearby
shadows plugging down a few alleyways you hear
some voices in the distance some conversations
some shouting and then some footfalls that get
loud and then get a little softer and
eventually a little softer and fade off You just
barely scraped by on that one
 You however darted off towards the open
office and as soon as you glance in there you can
see there is a desk set up there is a chair
there are a number of large books and stacks of
parchment It looks like there is a whole rack up
top with various medicinal herbs and salves that
are categorized into small makeshift cubbies This
is where a lot of the treatment seems to be mustered
 Well its clear for the moment but the man
who was just in this office just finished
throwing Nott outside and is in the process of
talking with the Crownsguard You dont know how
long you have until he returns
 You palm a bunch and throw it in there all
right You exit just as you see them returning to
the hallway with the physician straightening his
outfit making his way in your direction Doesnt
even make eye contact with you just brushes by
and shoulderchecks you which is hilarious
because the size of your visual is much smaller
so its like  Watch it and was two
inches away but doesnt seem to notice in the
moment that he actually did so Makes his way into
the office you hear the door close behind you
and the two other clerks frustratingly start
scattering and making their way to the other
chambers One of them is talking to the other
about I dont know what happened He went crazy
and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere
and theyre both making their way to the door
where Molly is in
 Okay You head back out onto the street You
are in that chamber for a while Are you doing anything
 Make an investigation check
 Ten Nothing easily does so You can try and
pry one of the panes out but theres a decent
chance it might break in the process if youre not
careful
 Youre going to try You take one of your
blades and you wedge it up underneath where the
metal bar is its holding the pane in place to
see if you can wedge it out Go ahead and make a
straight dexterity check
 It shatters and breaks on both sides of the
window You watch as the window shatters outward
 The pane itself is about that big so youre
going to take more of the window with you to do it
 All right You shoulderrollleap through
shattering the window out of the infirmary
rolling into the alley You see this happen as
Molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and
purple skin
 You guys bolt At this point as you head
back youve now seen the guards that have just
run off to go after Nott hear the shatter and turn
around to begin some of them to double back to
where the sound of the glass breaking came from
 Make a deception check
 Its too late
 They are
 Okay
  The guards approach and they both look
antsy but they see you pointing away and they
both head in the direction that you were heading
them off towards as Mollys about to leap into
your arms
 You guys have managed to find yourselves
back into the chaotic evening of the streets of Zadash
 Its like six
 Which is still there by the way
 Yeah As you guys make your way back to the
Leaky Tap to eventually meet up going through the
paperwork unfortunately none of them have
anything that signifies the HighRichter They all
seem to be various quick notes on bones breaks and
resets on various illnesses that have come
through and treatments that have been applied
keeping tabs on return visits Its all various
notes of
 Nothing from Lord Sutan unfortunately
 If you had possibly searched a little
longer you could have maybe found something you
think but given the circumstances it did not
occur
 So you didnt find anything you wanted to
and you probably definitely fucked up a few
peoples recovery routine But thats fine You
guys eventually find your way back to The Leaky
Tap Your monk and your cleric are waiting for
you and you watch as these four individuals walk
in looking a bit haggard
 Okay You work out the logistics of that
letter
 The guard dog that was outside of the home
 It was a mastiff
 From what you guys saw of the mastiff it
wasnt a show dog by any means but it wasnt a
street dog theyre just using for the moment
 One way to find out
 It looks like its a utility dog Youve
seen some dogs go around with members of the
crownsguard before as part of the general Its
more for an intimidation tactic Theyre rarely
ever utilized but the presence of a dog just make
some people especially those who work in darker
categories unsettled
 They were assigned
 All right As you guys work your way through
preparing this letter condensing your plots for
the next evening and eventually find yourself to
a nights rest in preparation for the next days
events were going to take a break
  Fucking DD
 Those are my favorite moments of the game
Im like I dont okay guys This is happening
This is all your fault
 So yes before we go to break our friends
at Wyrmwood have their giveaway for the evening

hasnt already and well get that to you so
congratulations So as you guys all prepare for
the evenings rest the next day is there
anything you needed to do before the next day
happens
 Okay As you finish the focus you glance
down at them extending your consciousness to see
if theres any residual magic energy Theyre not
enchanted but they are made of a very nice solid
platinum with a gold spiral lay on them once you
pull the dust off so theyre probably worth a
little bit of money
 For a goblins wrists theyre pretty big
Looks like theyre more they may have been made
for a more masculine figures wrists probably or
a thickarmed lass
 All righty Anybody else have anything to do
before the evenings rest or are you happy to
continue the next day
 All right so as the evening comes to a
close the next morning greets you on a somewhat
chilled misty morning the sky gray but the
light is out You can see a faint mist is burning
off of the streets in the early morning like six
or sevenish You all gather yourselves Is there
anything you wish to accomplish during the day or
do you wish to jump ahead to the meeting of the
afternoon the evening
 Yeah the festival is happening this
evening
 I mean the harvest is celebrated at
different points and in a few weeks is the
official Harvest End festival This is done in
advance its more of a private event that is for
the more elite Some folks come in from out of
town from local smaller townships that are pretty
well off and trying to rub elbows with the local
elite Its a festival that contains food music
drink Youve never been to one of course and
youve heard of it from the time you spent in
Zadash Youve never seen it but youve seen
folks take care through the street towards the
event and it seems to be fairly like a more
subdued Mardi Gras colors but the colors are more
reds and browns and golds They have masks theyll
wear for it but they arent full face just
habitual eye masks Only some will some folks
dont get fully into the spirit
 All right Whos helming the expedition to
acquire costume pieces
 Molly go ahead and make an investigation
check

 Ill say because of your dress Ill give
you advantage on this
  It takes you the better part of the
morning About noon you manage to find a place
that will sell similar outfits Since a lot of
them are either custommade for the individuals
that are going its hard to find a place There
is no shop that sells fancy clothes to the random
folks who arent going to the event but you
manage to find a few individuals that can cobble
together a few masks and basic attire Because
its a quick build its going to be a little
pricier than normal cost so the commission will
take the better part of the afternoon and will be
ready by sundown for enough outfits for six of
you Or accoutrements
 Youll be fine its just a mask Id say
between all of you for the time the materials
and the construction of it itll run you about
three gold pieces
 Okay How many sausages do you want
 In case you get hungry Fair enough Okay
Thats going to put you back a silver
 Ulog is meeting you guys you want to try
and search for him
 Make a perception check
 You have no idea where Ulog is or if hes
in the vicinity unfortunately All right so
 You gather the outfits that were
commissioned for you You have your materials As
the day grows later eventually the sun begins to
crest over the western mountain range The sky
though cloudy still the colors begin to shift to
the oranges and purples of dusk You begin to see
carriages come through the streets and make their
way towards the TriSpire district
 One of the carriages just passed you and
its about a block up the way if you want to try
and catch up
 All right As you guys head back towards the
entryway to the sewers where you had previously
been with your various outfits and attire you
can see now theres not two crownsguards theres
a single crownsguard at the moment You approach
and you see theyre not directly against the
grate theyre across the street It doesnt
appear to be watched at the moment
 The entranceway into the sewers
 Well hes not looking at the entranceway to
the sewer
 Yes but there are lanterns and stuff up on
the side of the street
 Okay Evening
 I am well how are you
 Everybody else roll a stealth check
please
 Try the Pentamarket probably
 Make a persuasion check
 All right so down this way and he
starts giving you the full playbyplay of the
street corners to the Pentamarket where a candy
shop is that you had missed earlier So now you
know theres a candy shop in Zadash
 As its happening What did you roll
 Hold on so a natural one eight  
Okay natural ones tricky
 Still a natural one But yeah that brings
it to nine As you guys begin to quickly slide in
one after the other Nott as youre rushing down
youre glancing off because you hear them talk
about candy for a second over the side
 As you rush down the side whack You hit
your head and give out a natural instinct a
pained squeak As you do the guard whos talking
to Jester goes Wha
 Make a deception check
 Seven
 Hold Just a second
 He begins walking over to the sewer edge He
steps over and begins to glance down
 Hes looking back at you like
 From where Out of the sewer you mean
 As soon as Frumpkin He kicks and

 Misses

 Well he got scared by the cat The first
guy was a dick this guy was  like kicking
wildly Anyway He falls back and Frumpkin runs
off Hes like  It seems to be enough to
take him off the scent of Nott and he turns
around Miss He walks up and helps you up
 Right all right Well go get your candy
Have a good night
  He goes back to his post You guys
make your way through the sewer back up through
the Tintersection
 All right Fair enough Frumpkin does slowly
make his way back to join you You make your way
towards the gate and without issue are entered
into the TriSpire You make your way towards the
side of the alleyway where the
 You did not
 Jester do you want to go do that
 You guys are sitting there waiting for
Jester to show up and meet you to let you out
 You however you make your way to the Song
and Supper and on the inside you can see
nervously at a table in a dark cloak Ulog What
the Gets up and meets you outside shoves you
back out there and you both begin to walk
sidebyside I was waiting here long enough
 Make a deception check
 He goes Right Well wheres the rest of
your team
 He looks down and he has fairly plain dark
clothing for nightstealthing He has like a
single looks like a gold chain of some kind with
a single yellowish amberorange bead on it that
looks like its worth a gold or two Dark
greenbrown cloak Its hard to see the color
this late at night He doesnt look super rich
 Yeah
 You put some of the festive wear on him
Its all not at all fitted for him and it looks
like a kid who has outgrown his snowoutfit and
hes like This is humiliating
 Hes seething beneath it You can see him
grinding his teeth but he follows you
nevertheless
 You make your way to the gate once more The
guards there One of them walks up and the same
one from earlier gives you a nod Hold
 Make another deception check
 He goes A comedian Tell me a joke
 Ulog looks at you with the mask back at the
guard Um
 He goes What do you call the king on his
birthday The crownsguard goes I dont know
What do you call a king on his birthday An
arsehole The guard goes
  At which point the two guards

 Ulog like gets off the ground and glares at
you this very furious fiery stare and then gets up
and then stumbles again and falls on the ground
flat again The guard goes
 All right get in
Ulog now has like a bloody nose and as you
ushers him in he looks back Oh were going to
talk later
 You eventually make your way over to the
edge of the alley coming up to the hatch that
leads you out of the sewer There you guys see the
two approaching shapes of Jester and Ulog Ulog
looking festive if the wear is a bit tiny making
his hair and beard poof out of the sides of
the mask
 Well first off Im pretty keen at
infiltration I have a long past of doing sort of
the breaking and entering thing Plus I want to
be there when this happens Have a personal stake
 I know the area alright
 Do you think you know where he lives
 All right Thats all we need The rest we
can all do Lead on
 Yeah go for it
 
 Well there goes the campaign As you guys
make your way through the city streets you can
see the closer you get to the Silken Terrace for
one the usual silk banners that adorn the various
edges of the streets have been changed from the
usual white silk banners to bright yellows bright
browns bright reds The colors of autumn are now
starting to show and appear throughout the vicinity
 You also hear the music begin to swell at
the various performing bands towards the center
where this gala is You can see all the banners
leaning in the center space The sunset colors
have vanished and now the night sky holds above
The Crownsguard are clustered in greater numbers
in the TriSpire specifically to keep a perimeter
around the event As you glance off to the
entrance gate where you were you can see theres
now stationed more towards that space since you
originally passed through More musicians are
arriving some locally some appear to be from
other areas within the actual Empire The social
elite are gathering in the center of the Silken
Terrace and you can now see the small carriages
are stopping and letting other individuals out to
join the crowds the mingling beginning You can
already see about  or  people with more still
arriving They all have their various colors and
masks on Theyre all grabbing drinks and laughing
and seeing old friends and introducing themselves
to new people they havent met before Some of
them live in the TriSpire some that live
throughout and beyond
 Make a perception check
 Make a perception check
 Unfortunately youre too far away and the
masks obscure any of sort of details Youre
unable to see anyone you recognize per se But
you do see that there are long tables that mark
the perimeter that are already holding already
preset glasses of wine and ciders You can see the
central tower of the Triumph Chime sits glowing
right at the front and center of this gala Its
all surrounding the base of it And up in a spiral
you can see lanterns and similar colors of
autumn that spiral up the front of it You guys
begin to carefully and out of sight make your
way towards the estate of Lord Sutan Please make
stealth checks everybody
 Pretty good spread You guys duck in
between avoiding being seen and blend in with the
crowd as you pass other individuals that are
making their way to the actual Gala event There
are nods and smiles occasional laugh as folks
are conversing and chatting as they pass You make
your way over to the outskirts of the Gilded
Willows beyond the Skyscape Park and where the
Constellation Bridge tower stands to see for
many of you the first time the threestory dark
wood home of Lord Sutan The marble pillars mark
the cornerstones of where the metallic iron fence
gate matches the perimeter Theres a singular
tree and still there are two guards posted at one
and the same guard with the dog at the other
 Well its been a day later
 Seems to be
 If look at the if the buildings a square
The house is mainly built as a rectangle theres
the front door and the back where the
cellar door is and theres the perimeter fence
 In the front there are two guards In the
back where the gate and the cellar door is
theres a singular guard and his dog The tree is
up on this side
 Its just on the interior of it Just within the
gate
 Correct
 Probably not no
 Whos staying outside
 The two of you All right
 If we can manage if what youre saying
about this tree we can possibly scoot past their
visual range and not have to worry about it And
just use that as a backup
 But we got to climb the tree
 All right Those that are staying at the
base The rest of us lets get to climbing
 Its about five feet
 We get to the top you use your little cat
thing to distract it Preferably the other side of
the fence
 Right Your cat On the other side of the
fence While theyre faced and focused in that
direction we make our ascent
 That might be on one of you
 All right
 Actually not a bad idea
 Its cloudyThe sky itself is cloudy and
has been Even though the storm blew by its
still pretty heavy cloud cover
 Those who are climbing the tree athletics
checks please
 Yeah you can do that So Beau goes first
 For climbing well say athletics
 It doesnt have a lot of branches
 Eight Well youre not helping anybody
 You get partway up and Ulog is
actually like  Hes doing fine So he
pushes you up the rest of the way
 You climb up fine skittering up past them
You actually climb over Beau and Ulog to get to
the top first
  Thats fine You manage to get up there 
And Caleb
 You guys all get up there Beau is the last
to arrive
 Its one if those things too where she
starts first but each person keeps putting their
feet in her face on the way up
 Okay you guys get up to the top of the
tree
Youre up in the branches in the bow at
the top You can see now its a beautiful view of
the gala in the distance You can see the three
towers all arcing up all lit from underneath
from the lanterns and the light that have been
significantly brightened for the events of the
evening You have a clear shot of the rooftop
which is at a slight decline from this current
position Its about ten feet from you and about
three feet down below You can see there are two
smokestacks that look like theyre attached to
fire places that might be good indicators of
places to connect the rope Whos throwing the
rope
 He takes it Hes like All right You got
to be pretty good at aiming this
 Its about   feet from here
 But can you aim it
 So go ahead and roll a d and add your
strength modifier
 You throw it Tink tink
 Okay Theres this roll of thunder off in
the distance It didnt catch anything though
and its scraping Pulling back a little bit
 It didnt manage to It got over to the
roof but it didnt catch anything
 Okay So you pull it and it scrapes falls
and then dangles down You manage to pull it up a
little bit dangle it up yeah
 Are you just throwing it
 All right So
 He was holding the other side of it The
grapple arcs up really high and arcs past
Theres a brief moment where you see it go up and
then pass by you heading down towards the wall
Is anyone going to do anything
 You could try
 Go ahead and roll
 It looks like its just out of the grasp
Shes going to try so go ahead and roll a d
 Yeah Thats fine So you manage to just
catch it holding onto the edge of the rope
before it clanks onto the ground Its just
dangling now
 You pull it slowly back up
 You going to try
 Okay And leap Make an athletics check
Ill give you advantage because of the step of the wind
 Your jump distance is doubled Yeah youre
fine
 Youre fine
 Just roll for the hell of it I just want to
see what happens
 You off the branch leap No sound
 You grab it affix it easily to one of the
smokestacks you find up there
 All right
 Ulog takes it and ties the other side of the
rope You guys can all begin to shimmy across and
make your way
 So The rope is set up Are you guys just
going to shimmy across
 Youre not there You cant see it from
here
 Theres no balconies on this house
 Make an investigation check
  You dont find an entry way per se One
of the chimneys is wide enough for someone to pass
through It looks like there is a part of the roof
that if you were to try and remove some of the
shingles there might be some sort of entrance
below it
 Youre on an angle there on each side
 You watch as Frumpkin runs past cat
yowling outside of the gate Immediately dog
barking Hes like No  The
dog drags him to the opposite side like around
the outside into the fence and is now trying to
bite And Frumpkins on the other side of the
fence going   right
into the fence The guys still holding back like
Shit no stop God stop it Is pulling You
guys all make it acrossno one seems to notice
none the wiseronto the roof
 You guys are watching you guys are on
 Perception check from both you guys
 Thats up to them
 Okay Keeping an eye out there there isnt
any at the moment notable individuals wandering
towards or snooping around the house or your
position So you feel pretty safe
 And change into a crownsguard
Okay Got it
 You guys you are on the roof
 There are two chimneys
 There is the slight roof thing that you
saw
 Easy enough to do All right So
 The barking slows The dog is still barking
in the direction of what was there and seems to
be still really entranced with the possibility of
getting that fucking cat Frumpkin does find his
way to you Molly Guys on the roof what are you
doing
 Some of them loosen and slip a little bit
and you can see theres a very very faint groove
on the wood beneath it Like a gap
 Okay  off in the
distance As you begin to pry a little bit it
begins to move up There is some sort of a hatch
 It feels like a trap door a little bit
 As its pulling up the shingles that are
overlapped on it are overlapping the gap and start
sliding a little bit You immediately feel like if
you open this youre going to send a bunch of
shingles sliding off of the roof
 There is a very faint trail of smoke coming
out of the chimney by the way
 So you begin to collect them Where are you
putting them
 Okay So you take a moment to go ahead and
carefully You have a collection now of roughly
 roof shingles in your haversack
 So you can add that to your equipment
 Well say it takes you about five minutes or
so to finally get all those off carefully You
manage to pry it open and it opens up ever so
slightly and theres a chain on each end that
prevent it from  It opens up just
enough that you can slip inside and there is a
small ladder there that you can use to slowly get
down into a small attic
 Okay You cast Detect Magic
 Right  feet in the vicinity
 Okay It only goes down about five feet or
so Its a very small crawl space
 You do Its a very small crawl space Its
maybe like ten foot by five foot Its very
dusty in here It looks like there are a few clay
pots There looks to be a portrait like some sort
of a large art piece thats leaning against the
wall and has some cobwebs over it Other than
that it looks fairly empty like it hasnt been
used fully You casting Detect Magic Let me
check real fast
Yeah So you look around the
vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any
sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace
 Make an investigation check
 You do find there is another trapdoor on
the opposite end of the crawl space that is
partially blocked by the art piece thats leaning
against it You shift it out of the way and
unhinge the top and it opens and drops down to a
hallway that has like faint a crackling firelight
inside this hallway You glance down inside You
can see a long hallway with tapestries on each
wall of a beautiful writing There are two
ornamental armor sets that are set up on the side
You can see an ornamental sword that is bolted on
the wall on the opposite end and stairs not too
far from where you are that head further down into
the building and there is a doorway that leads to
the right on the opposite end of the hallway
 He is but he is behind you guys at this
point
 All right The two of us will keep an eye
for traps Hes giving you an advantage Hes
giving you the help actually You were down to
casting what spell You were casting
 Okay
 You go down and there are two torches that
are burning in the edge but they dont have a
fuel source They are an everburning torch and
they are both fixed to the wall giving this
flickering light in the vicinity Youve come down
to the hallway
 So you guys have made your way down into the
hallway Youre still concentrating the spell
right
 There are magical auras emulating from these
torches Theyre both everlight Youve seen this
magic before They just continuously burn Its
continual flame You also get a faint magical aura
from each of the suits of armor and a faint
magical aura from the sword across the way on the
opposite wall
 Go ahead and make an investigation check
with advantage
 Whatd you roll A 
  You carefully go forward and both you
and Ulog pay attention The floorboards of this
hallway progress one after another and theres a
cluster about four of them about
afootandahalf across each of them that are
slightly lifted on one side Glancing forward you
can see theres some sort of pressure device that
triggers when those boards are stepped on
 Youre not sure
 Actually fine
 Correct I would say Thats an interesting
question
 Let me check something real fast
 Well say it can go in two different ways
Im not entirely sure
 No no I do here It would be
 Well say conjuration
 No transmutation which you know well
 Jester As you finish concentrating on the spell and
focusing on the wax seal you get a blip of its
location in the next chamber beyond where you are
in the door on the right
 As this is happening Ulog is sighing
loudly pulls out some tools and begins to fiddle
with where the boards are on the ground He
manages to get a shortsword of his pressed
underneath where the boards are and slips it
across slightly lifting each one as he goes until
the sword peeks out the opposite side acting as a
platform beneath
 He goes and carefully steps on the boards
and then steps across with no effect
 Roguesplaining technically
 As you guys head in theres the closed door
that leads into the chamber where youre sensing
this aura
  okay It is trapped
 Yes Its not locked but it is trapped
 Make a perception check
  You listen out You do not hear any
movement in the house other than what you
currently are making
 And a hiccup from out in the distance
 Perception check from both of you guys by
the way while this is happening
 Okay You dont seem to notice anything All
right So you guys
 All right You pull out your thieves
 Well find out Go ahead and make a thieves
tools check So roll a d add your proficiency
modifier and your dexterity modifier Should be
plus six I think
  As you carefully get down to where the
knob is you begin to turn it ever so slightly and
you hear this spring begin to tighten and youre
familiar with that sound So you manage to get
your tool underneath and you find where the
spring is its barely in the space between where
the door and the edge of the door frame is You
get the tool underneath capture it and as you
pull the door open it prevents the spring from
pulling back into the device You slowly as you
expose it reach in snap the opposing side and
remove the spring entirely leaving the trap
inert
 As the door opens into a fairly
welldecorated master bedroom You see a large
canopy bed a beautiful detailed embroidered rug
that consumes the center of the floor You can see
a fireplace to your right the one that you saw
that was attached to the top of the roof that has
a fire burning in it It has two giant statues of
lions on each side this cool detailed shelf
there You can see a table with chairs to your
left You can see a slight opening to a balcony
thats not visible from the outside
 Okay Youre just scanning the room
 All right As you glance in and look there
is immediately to your left a large metal cabinet
of some kind It is made of dark iron and gives a
very faint magical aura to it The rug in the
center of the room gives a faint magical aura as
well
 Youre looking for
 Okay investigation check You glance around
and look in the chamber You dont see anything
that gives the essence of a trap to you It looks
like the trap was part of the entry here but
theres nothing immediately in the vicinity that
resembles a triggering trap
 The carpet Its also transmutation and the
magic on the large case has a faint abjuration
 Its underneath the rug
 Mage Hand Very helpful when setting
grappling hooks on roofs
 Im just saying if I knew you could do
that you couldve
 Investigation check
 You can only see magical sources from what
you can see So if a things behind a wall or
behind an object you dont see an aura
 Natural  As theyre having this
conversation you glance by the fireplace the
fire is crackling in there and you glance down
and right underneath the hearth up where the
fires tickling you see a piece of the stonework
that doesnt match the others its slightly
offcolored It looks like the burning of the fire
thats been given this dark and blackened look to
it theres one brick there that doesnt seem to
have been affected by any of the soot at all
 As your finger presses against the brick it
slides in about a half an inch and you hear this
 sound over by where the metal large
cabinet is
 Yes
 It vanishes

 Okay the carpet peels back and it reveals
beneath it a section of the wood that has a hinge
bolted to one side of it Its a square thats cut
out of it it looks like its an open case The
carpet peels back and then begins to fold back in
its space and then fold up again It begins to
slightly shift and rise and the carpet almost
seems to be gliding in the air on its own in the
vicinity It spins towards you and then rushes
in your direction I need everyone to roll initiative
 That carpet is now gone because instead you
are fighting that carpet

 All righty so Nott wouldve been over
here
 Yes roll initiative please Beau youre
over by the fireplace so youve just seen that
happen there and I think thats
 Right right
 I forgot my dwarf mini
 Well no its in here somewhere Forgot to
bring it out I am unprepared
 Thats fine Ill use this Ill say that
thats him there its fine Given that case
guys first its a surprise round as it whips its
way over towards Nott
 It does because it suddenly rushes in your
direction That is going to be a  to hit
 Natural  It goes and wraps around you and
completely envelops you within itself All of a
sudden you just see darkness and you cannot
breathe
 Currently you are enveloped by the Rug of
Smothering
 Initiative here Top of the round  to 
anybody
  thatll be you first Nott  to 
 Beau  to 
 Whatd you get Caleb
 Its true Nott its your turn first You
are restrained you are blinded and you are
suffocating At the start of your turn you
immediately take  points of bludgeoning damage
as its now crushing and constricting your entire
body You feel the life being pulled out of you as
youre gasping for breath in this space What are
you going to do with your turn
 Yes you can still talk Youre muffled
sounds You still have the breath you had in your
body when it went around you so Ill say you have
enough air for one spell and then thats all
 Is that a spell attack roll
 Yeah you would have disadvantage because
youre restrained but its also smothering you so
I would give you advantage to that so its just a
straight roll
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Good to know
 Nope
 No you are restrained You can try and
break free but its an action to try
 But hey there you go Jester youre up
 Okay You see it wrapping around and Notts
flailing about as this carpet is crushing her
little body Go ahead and
 Yes Go for it
 Oh yeah that hits Go ahead and roll damage
on that
 Okay it takes eight points of radiant
damage and Nott takes seven points of radiant damage
 As you blast you hear Nott muffled
screaming underneath you get the sense all the
damage dealt to this rug is divided with whoever
its enveloping
 Jester you going to stay where you are
 Sorry you wouldve been probably over
here
 You going to move or stay here
 You move around and stand on the bed
 All righty That ends your turn Jester
Beau youre up
 That hits Roll damage
 Thats three to you Nott
 Seven damage Thats four damage to the
thing and you fail a death saving throw
 No thats on a critical She wasnt
attacking Nott specifically She was attacking the rug
 Okay So you hit it twice
 All right And it makes a what saving throw
Constitution
 That is an 
 All right What do you want to know about
it
 It is actually not vulnerable to anything
 You learned it is not vulnerable to
anything
 Now its Ulogs turn Ulog who sees the rug
there is going to rush over and attempt to
 I know It was the best I could find in the
moment you know
 Its fine He rolls a two because NPCs that
I try and fight with cant roll shit That misses
That misses To your benefit Ulog tries to stab
and is missing or hitting the edge of the tassels
Its not even making an impact on the rug He is
going to use a bonus action to disengage and head
back towards where the balcony is All right So
that goes ahead and ends that That brings us to
the rugs turn The rug is going to go ahead and
release Nott and is going to attempt to
completely envelop Beau
 Thats cocked That is another  
 You Beau are now enveloped by the rug
 All righty Thats going to go ahead and end
the rugs turn
 Actually the rugs going to go ahead
because it can still move Well its speed is
nothing nevermind
 Well it would move her away No its not
going to do that
 It doesnt have enough movement to move
much That brings us to the bottom Caleb youre up
 Go ahead and roll for the heal on that
 All righty So how much does Nott heal
 There you go Top of the round Nott your
turn As you come to consciousness you are still prone
 Caleb moved around to join your side there
to go ahead and apply the potion
 You know what go ahead and make an
athletics check
 No You rush up and you grab it and it
actually lifts you off your feet and you are now
being flailed in the air as youre grabbing the
edge of the rug going 
 All right that ends your turn Jester
youre up
 Okay You move up Go ahead and make an
athletics check
  You grab and youre not pulled off your
feet but the rug is too strong and its not quite
releasing its hold on Beau Beau its your turn
At the top of your turn you suffer ten points of
bludgeoning damage
 As its crushing your body on the inside and
you cannot breathe It is your turn though You
can still go
 What are you doing Beau
 Yeah you just have disadvantage on the
attacks
 So it was an 
 Misses
 Its just too tight You cant quite get any
movement to hit it Its a bad space for you
 That ends your turn It is now Ulogs go
Ulog is going to rush up and attempt to stab at it
as he sees it wrapping around there That is a 
That hits
 Yeah I know
 It does do sneak attack damage because you
guys are in the vicinity
 He doesnt know Hes trying to help Thats
going to be  points of piercing damage so six
to the rug and six to you
 The rug is starting to look a little torn up
in places and you can see bits of Beau showing
through where the gashes are stabbing through
Its looking fairly hurt
 Its the rugs turn The rug is going to
attempt to shift itself and Beau a little bit away
this direction It can only get five feet because
its speed is halved pulling you along with it and
its speed is ten So Nott you get an attack of
opportunity if you want to take one
 You whip out your shortsword quickly
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage with
sneak attack If you want to sneak attack You
dont have to
  all right Thats eight to the rug and
seven to Beau
 The rug is barely holding on by a thread
You see it still keeps her constrained You see
parts of it are fraying and falling apart The
threads are dangling but its still keeping its
mass strongly and tightly around her Its still
crushing her and mainly wrapped around her face so
she cant see and she cant breathe That ends the
rugs turn Caleb youre up
 Youre up
 Make an athletics check
 There it is Youre trying to pull and you
get some threads that snap off and youre like
Shit Its not working Youre not getting the
right grasp on it
 That ends Calebs turn Nott youre up
 No its you and then Jester
 Yeah that hits Go ahead and roll damage
If you want to do it with sneak attack up to you
 It looks like its doing pretty rough Its
up to you
 So thats five damage to Beau and the rug
 You tear through the rug You cut through
and the rug bisects but you also see that where
you cut through also cut across the front of Beau
as her eyes roll back and she plops onto the
ground the rug falling in pieces to the ground
around her coming to rest
 Okay go ahead and cast Cure Wounds to
heal
 So you gather all the pieces of the rug to
join your shingles
 It does not appear to be
trapped It does appear to be locked Roll again
 Correct
 Yeah easy enough  You manage
to open it up and there is a small chest about
that big that rests in a small cubby beneath
 As you open the chest make a constitution
saving throw
 Okay
 So first theres a sudden burst of a brief
light through it and all your muscles tense up
and you are paralyzed
 Ulog goes No traps and pulls it open No
issue
 Inside with Ulog you see a beautiful set of
burgundy and gold robes that are up hanging you
see a set of polished bracers made of cobalt steel
that are both dangling on a hook and you see
three ancient statuettes like relics or
collectors items that are arranged on the bottom
of it that all look like old museum pieces
 Are you still concentrating
 Thats true you didnt take any damage
None of them are glowing except for the cobalt
bracers
 Make a history check
 Ten You do not unfortunately
 Holding to the chest The chest which is now
open in Notts hand
 No
 On the inside there is a faint glow If you
look inside you see theres a cluster of platinum
pieces Theyre stacked on the side and have
shifted around from the movement You see a single
polished river stone about that big that is
giving a glowing aura and you see a few sticks of
wax and a single pressed wax seal
 You do not see in this vicinity any letters
or handwriting no
 Marisha make a perception check You both
make perception checks
  You do glance
 Good to know You glance off to the side and
there is a desk in the corner that has two sets of
drawers that are currently closed
 Okay You grab it and put it in your
pocket
 Okay
 Okay 
 Mostly its just blank parchment You do see
a few notes that are maybe partially written
letters that were crumpled up and thrown in there
that are Lord Sutans handwriting
 Okay Go ahead and roll for your forgery
kit So roll a d add your proficiency modifier
and your intelligence modifier
 Im sorry guys
 Sure Ill say since you were helping her
that Ill give you advantage on the roll
 Advantage on the roll So roll one more
time
 You start making one and its not quite
working out and Beau looks over your shoulder
points it out you take it
 You throw it in the fireplace and incinerate
that one and then make another one This one is
pretty solid and it matches the writing
perfectly
  Done
 In the current room There is a shelf in the
hallway that you can see that has a few books
 No theres nothing glowing
 Okay
 You guys make your way back up to the
entranceway up into the crawlspace above the
attic pull it closed and latch it You move the
art piece back over You make your way back to the
edge of the roof where you guys had exited
climbing the ladder thats attached to it making
your way onto the roof getting Nott up there
manhandled Ulog following you as you get to the
top You close it
 You put the shingles back in the space For
that Im going to have to have you both roll
dexterity checks please Or since youre
helping have you roll a dexterity check with
advantage because youre helping her
 Yes
  Okay You manage to find and arrange
them in a way where they arent going to slide off
and even with a bit of rain thats in there you
find the pockets where they originally mostly
sitting so theyre not going to coast with any
sort of weather shift
 All right You guys are noticing at this
point as theyre on the roof because youre
paying attention you see them begin to emerge on
the roof as you begin to see a cluster of
crownsguard doing a pass through the street
 Yeah
 Theres four of them that are approaching
and theyre going by and keeping an eye on things
 Okay
 What kind of disturbance
 Make a deception check
 Technically no because you werent part of
it
 Had to catch it before the roll
unfortunately
 Thats okay  he rolled a one The
snitch isnt working for me tonight
 So the two of them dont seem to quite buy
into it but the two of them that go Well all
right Well follow Lead on Leads the three
you jog along Two of them continue their route
 Keep moving along
 Were all right but thank you They keep
walking
 Frumpkin makes his way around 
Again the dog unleashes a torrent of barks like
No not again You hear the other guy being
pulled across the yard Hes being dragged through
the wet grass You guys begin to make your way
across Whos carrying Nott across
 Make an athletics check as you try to make
your way across the rope
 So do you want to save yourself or Nott
Because one of you is falling
 As you grasp you loop Nott around the rope
As you lose your grip feeling it coming and you
tumble down
Falling three stories
 So you take  points of bludgeoning damage
as you crack Hit the ground
 As you impact the two guards that were
talking to you and chatting
immediately whip around and see Jester on
the ground and put their hands on their weapons
and begin rushing towards her
 Youre on the outside of the fence yeah
 Like just barely You just missed the wall
 Nott is up on the rope hanging and
dangling
 Sure You tug her over onto the roof
  damage
 Make a deception check
 You should have said before the roll

 Okay They both go All right miss They
pick you up and the other guy takes your arm and is like
 Right All right They drag you and start
bringing you towards the gates out of the
TriSpire
 So you two make your way
 Miss youve got to sober up and you can
find your way back tomorrow morning So they
escort you out of the TriSpire You guys are
pushed beyond the gates and theres now eight
guards at each gate that are preventing any
passage in and out You guys are shoved back out
into the city
 However that distraction gives you guys
enough time to get the rest of you over and down
to the beyond the tree
 Okay So you guys all get across You
leaving the rope there or are you detaching it
 Okay
 Make a dexterity check
 Aw Gil
 Its about ten feet from you
 Okay The rope does break and the grapple
bends The grapples not usable anymore You do
remove the evidence but the grapples not usable
at the moment
 As you guys pull yourselves away from the
vicinity about  minutes later as you guys are
collecting yourselves eventually the paralysis
wears off
 It lasted for an hour total
 What are you guys doing
 Yeah Ulog pulls out a pocket watch and he
looks and it and is like Oh she better fucking
hurry up Lets go You guys make your way over
towards where the HighRichters home is
 The two of you guys head back
 You guys are heading back to where the sewer
is youre saying
 There is another entrance Its on the
northern side
 Could be
 Okay you rush around through the street
You make your way back to the northern gate to the
district and there there is another nine or ten
guards stationed with one on the top of the wall
with their crossbow ready
 As you approach Hey Sorry no entry The
gala is tonight
 Make a deception check
 I know The rolls have been phenomenal
 
 Gives you both a look over
All right then
 Yeah Because of yeah you can take a
short rest
 You get that back
 So you guys get to use hit dice they do
not
 There you go
 Yeah You guys carefully find a space thats
away and out of sight probably by one of the
small fountains on the side and you all sit there
and rest for a bit having drinks Eventually you
guys manage to catch up with the rest of the group
as theyre finishing their short rest Youve
reconvened you have your materials
 Ulogs staring at his pocket watch again
looking off at the gala in the distance is like
All right if were going to fucking do
something lets do it
 Ah and he looks off and is like I dont
know Fuck it Lets go now I cant wait any longer
 No Youre on the outskirts of the home and
youve been here once before this wall is not an
iron gate Its an actual solid tall stone and
mason wall thats pretty tight Theres maybe a
threefoot gap between the side of the house like
three or fourfoot gap from the side of the house
to this The building is two stories There is the
upper balcony that overlooks the whole exterior of
the area before it There are the two guards at
the front
 Okay In what outfit
 All right What are the rest of you guys
doing
 Make a perception check with advantage
because theyre helping you on this one
 You dont see any secret entrances you
dont see any other gates Looks like the front
door is the main way to get in or over the wall
There is no one watching the back as it is a
solid gate It seems like the only entrance is
from the front and thats probably intentional
from a defensive standpoint
 The wall is about let me check real fast
This would be sevenfoot
 You glance down A small area of wildflower
and natural bushes have grown to fill the space in
between where its thighhigh There is a door in
the back near the wall with a small yard maybe
a tenfoot yard towards the very back area
Theres a small porch area with nice chair and a
little reading nook Theres a book left outside
that looks like it got rained on and forgotten
its dried and crinkled There is a door that
leads in from the back of that porch area there
 There are no people in the back
 Make an athletics check Sorry acrobatics
for you
 Without even touching the wall you
doubleflip in the air and land ever so silently
You almost land on the book table causing it to
knock over but you just miss it Youre there
quietly now theres the door across the way What
are you guys doing
 You approach the two guards and they both
look at each other
 Make a deception check
  They both go Oh shit Right in
 One pulls out the key unlocks the gate They
open from each side as you rush through Make a
deception check for you as well
 With advantage because youre dressed as
her
 They both go Maam They both pull back
frightened You go to the front door Its locked
 One of them rushes forward and unlocks it
glancing out of the side of his eye towards you shaking
 Gah Opens the door and it throws open
 They close the door quietly behind you
 No It is dark There is no light source on
the inside right now
 Its low light through the vicinity You see
the interior chamber that is
 It is gaudy as fuck in here You see all the
walls have really intricate siding and theres
inset designs that are carved into it with
statues and busts of various elven figures The
main chamber leads to a spiral staircase that
leads to the second floor You see three busts on
each side of all these different elven very
regallooking figures adorning each side You see
around the side of it to the right there appears
to be a dining hall with a long table

 There you go To the left it looks like a kitchen vicinity
and theres the spiral staircase that leads up
 Outside of the wall where you guys are
Ulogs like My turn Give me a lift
 Are we not going in
 Make an athletics check
  You climb up over the wall and get to
the very top He puts his hands up Help me
 Because I helped put this together I want
to be here I want to make sure this happens
 Understand she might have paperwork up
there that could absolve my wife
 Make a persuasion check
 He gives you a nice solid look and goes
Understood and then leaps up onto the wall and
off the other side landing next to Nott
 He glances up sees you gone and leaps He
barely crests the top Hes a nimble dwarf
 Make an investigation check
 Make it with advantage
 As you glance about the space you can see
the statues that are facing each other on each
side it looks like the dust on the pedestal is
brushed off in an arc like they are often rotated
 Because you rolled a natural  you notice
that the dust thats grinding is from the sliding
of the statues and they all seem to slide towards
the stairs If you look where the dust is on them
theres a slight outcropping on each of them and
the position appears like they have been moved
many times away theyre facing each other to
look toward the stairs
 As you do that they both 
and you hear this  sound The first two
they shift over towards that matching the space
where the dust had shifted and you hear a slight
click or release sound
 Theres three sets of these So you do one
then the other
 You do it together all three of them shift
and with each one you hear a click and release
You guys are in the backyard Are you doing
anything
 The three of you are back there with the
lock
 The back door is locked Make an
investigation check if youd like
 I know look at this The back door is
locked it is not trapped
 You go and get the tools in there and it
gets stuck
 Oh so now you need my help Perfect
Yeah thatll do it He goes ahead and takes them
from you and then  gets it pulls them out
gently hands them back to you
 Like Ghoststyle He does so but he does so
begrudgingly Hes like  He pulls away
and quickly gets it and hands them back to you
Here you go
 Ugh Opens the door you guys hear the
slight creaking of a doorway down in the second
floor as youre ascending the stairs
 You glance inside It does not appear
anything in the vicinity Its a dining room You
can see the opposite side of a long table with
chairs Make a perception check
 No you heard a door down below You heard
them enter from elsewhere in the building but you
just heard a 
 What
 Yes
  Jumps down into the back and goes
and catches up to you You glance inside Nothing
magical catches your attention in the chamber
 Yes Make a stealth check You as you begin
to set up busking one of the other guards
wandering by comes by kicks your cards a bit and
goes Hey hey Move along No street busking
too late Galas on
 I said piss off Keep moving
 He sits there and watches you do it
 Okay What did you roll for stealth
 You walk around as youre casing the joint
as youre watching you keep an eye on the two
guards to the front The two guards are looking
out and one of them makes eye contact with you
and as you walk he watches you walk and you
realize that moment that youve been noticed
 Youre being watched from a distance
 No most everybodys at the gala right now
You can see in the distance you can see the
partys still going on The musics still playing
from the distance Theres still drinking and
revelry muffled in the distance the din of the
crowd giving this low 
 Hes not following you Hes just watching
you as you walk So youre going to try and move
out of his eyesight
 You move out of his eyesight
 Perception check
 Nothing seems to catch your eye no one
following you You guys you heard the creak from
downstairs What are you doing
 You head to the top floor Investigation
check both of you You guys what are you doing
 Theres a long dining room table with chairs
set up
 It leads out into a foyer area
 You get to the second floor Theres a small
landing and a singular door The door does not
appear to be locked or trapped
 As you guys head through the dining area
into the main foyer you see there is the hallway
that leads into the kitchen the staircase that
spirals upward and these statues that are all
facing towards the stairs The statues give off a
magical glow and you hear the sound of a 
upstairs a door slowly creaking open As you guys
look into the chamber as the door swings open
you see a darkened bedroom equally gaudy as the
rest of the house You can see along the walls
there are portraits of men human different ages
that are all lining it
 You can theres a small chamber an archway
that leads into a washroom You can see an ivory
basin thats barely visible from the little bit
the moonlight thats coming through a gable
window on the opposite side of the chamber
 It protrudes a bit arcs then ends there
In the center of where that gable window is
theres
 A roller desk The front has been rolled
shut Theres a door on each side of the gable
window that leads to the balcony that you saw
before that looks over everything Its a giant
glass window that looks out over the city It has
a beautiful view of the TriSpires and the gala in
the distance You can see the light emanating over
the dark night sky
 There is a large bed and floor itself is
covered in tiger and animal skins as a means of
decor in the space The walls themselves are a
faint grayblue velvet texture Its terrible
Thats what you have in front of you
 Right You guys all head up the stairs
together as a group Perception check on both your
guys points
 Five
 Okay You guys keep an eye out in the
vicinity Nothing seems to pique your interest
 Again Okay Good to know All right You
guys check around There are no traps in the
vicinity You do as you approach the roller desk
it is locked There is like an actual keyhole and
there is something that is meant to unlock the
desk
 Yeah And Ulog you guys all come up to the
landing and you can see the door inside Nothing
magical in the vicinity other than what you guys
have on yourselves
 Okay make an investigation check
 Reaching around the desk theres no tricks
no trips no buttons or anything Youre looking
through the bed
 Make an investigation check
 Nice Reaching underneath you find a hard
object a binding and you pull its a book You
slowly pull it out and take a look at it
 No Its a familiar leather tome that was an
illegal story that was previously presented to you
in a smut bookstore that had been hidden in the
cushions of the bed It has a place marker about
two thirds of the way through
 Ulog at this point is looking about the room
as well He rushes over to the desk where you are
and he goes Dont worry I got this Hes going
to go ahead and attempt to pick the lock on that
 Yeah you guys have all caught up Youre in
the room now
 As you glance through there is a faint
magical essence that begins to appear from the
desk as Ulog  opens it It slides open and
you see a faint glow from a small case about that
large sitting on the desk
 Thats fine He starts
 No hes going through paperwork
 Hes grabbing books and hes starting to
thumb through
 Yeah Go ahead and place the letter in
there
 There is no fireplace in this room
 You dont see a wastebasket necessarily no
Theres a small almost like a pot of some kind
that is set next to the desk that looks like it
might be used as a receptacle occasionally
 That would be evocation
 Make an intelligence check
  While the shape is not familiar to you
the size and the length of it youve seen these
type of cases before Theyre usually used to
contain important rolled pieces of parchment
specifically those that need to be protected from
the elements because they contain enchantments on
them This is a scroll case
 Ulog is going through papers frantically and
like searching through Hes going to make an
investigation check
 There looks like a space there its a
table it doesnt have a drawer or anything its
just a table you can hide something on or put
something underneath
 A faint bit theres like a candle and a
small piece of clockwork
 Okay At that point Ulog goes
 Right Theres another thing that you see
there There is a small box that is wrapped in
silver cord that is resting on the desk on top of
a stack of books
 Not at the moment
 Everything that youve seen yes
 There are giant gable windows You have the
most beautiful view of the city
 Make a perception check
 Yes
 Okay Well first off Ulog at this point is
going through and he goes I found it Hes
reading through and hes like frantically going
through the words That fucking bitch
 He starts reading out loud as youre
glancing over He says These are the notes on
Illianas case Saying that she wanted to show
that even the most unassuming dwarf can be a
cutthroat She admits that she was innocent but
did it anyway just to set an example
 He takes it and folds it Oh yeah we can
He holds it in his hand As you glance over to the
side you can see the front gate  open
Sorry you see it close  You hear the
sound You guys hear this as well though you were
trying to keep an eye over there you totally
found yourself spacing a bit and didnt notice
something shifting towards the door
 Okay
 Is it all set
 Out the back door All right You guys all
heading outside
 Make a perception
 Hold on Make a perception check Make a
sleight of hand check Thats what this is for
 You were
 Eight You notice him go for it
 You guys are all watching this from the
landing
 As you all slowly come to rest and look
back and Caleb as you walk out you stop at the
landing next to Ulog and Beau oh sorry youre
not there You stop next to Ulog as right there
at the bottom of the stairs looking up you see
in a very beautiful elegant dark green dress
the HighRichter Prucine Hmm My my Im glad I
forgot my gift or I would have missed you
reprobates breaking and entering the home of a
HighRichter I believe that carries a life
sentence in the Umber Dungeon wouldnt you say
If I might ask what are you looking for You
have my curiosity piqued Theres a brief pause
as youre all glancing down Ulog holds up the
paper in his hand and he goes You You put my
wife in chains and you know shes innocent We
got proof now Its over for you She chuckles
and scoffs as she falls onto her back leg And
how do you plan to deliver it Curious You think
my home wont be swarming with guards in a few
minutes She pulls a brass bell out from under
her pouch and rings it outside
 Its such a fast moment if you didnt have
anything prepared it happens too quickly Youre
like ah and the bell rings You stump sucker
Ill bleed over the extra years of your sentence
into your wifes That way you can both rot
together on opposite sides of the dungeon Ulog
looks at you all like absolute fury and sadness
in his eyes You see like tears down his cheek
 He goes and takes the paper in his hand and
puts it in your arm Caleb making eye contact
with you and goes Promise me youll see her
freed friend
 On her
 All righty Natural  She resists it She
goes What are you trying and Ulog goes
 grabs towards his neck and runs leaps off
the stairs towards her and attempts to tackle her
 You watch yeah He goes and  She
falls onto the ground and onto the landing of the
spiral staircase They both slide a moment You
watch as she goes What are you and he grabs
and pulls that orangeish bead that he had on his
necklace and slams it into her mouth and holds it
over Theres a moment of tension before
 A flash of white fiery burning
light explodes a fireball sundering the interior
of the staircase You all have your ears ringing
The pains there The ones that are closest by
would have been you Caleb I need you to roll a
dexterity saving throw please
 Thats a failure
 Thankfully a shitty roll for you That is 
points of fire damage
 Caleb goes unconscious onto the ground As
you guys all come to in the moment you look down
blackened the staircase is currently in the
process of burning and down you see the twisted
gnarled corpses of both Ulog and the HighRichter Prucine
 You hear 
 As you head down the stairway you can see
the front door being hit from the opposite side
 You guys watch this flash of light The
glass windows shatter outward from the balcony
The two guards at the bottom go Uh They
quickly throw open the gate and are now currently
slamming themselves trying to barricade into the
door
 Okay As you guys are rushing make a
perception check
 Okay As you guys are rushing you suddenly
hear this very loud highpitched whine sound
Youre like  It causes your head
to and you especially glance over as you begin
to surmise the direction you look past and you
can see the TriSpires there In the direction
you see the mighty Zauber Spire of the Halls of
Erudition there in the distance and you see there
this growing black spherical mass beginning to
emerge from the side of the lower third of the
tower You watch as it expands the whining gets
louder and louder
 You hear this crack sound as the black
sphere suddenly folds into nothing and where it
was you see all the stone that made that part of
the tower collapse crush and then stumble The
tower begins to slowly shift as you hear in the
distance screams echoing around The music stops
The attention of the guards suddenly shift over
from the banging door to the tower crumbling You
watch as the tower suddenly theres a flash of
blue light and the tower stops You see a brief
shift of a force field on the bottom that holds it
in place partially collapsed You see two figures
take off from the top
 You see two other figures leap out of the
hole from where the explosion weird black sphere
was at the base of it and leap down about 
feet below the tree line You see the two figures
begin coasting flying through the air in the
direction where they were as bolts of energy
start arcing out of their hands towards where
those two other figures fell The screams are
getting louder now and you can see now the guards
are starting to rush out of the various street
corners You guys are rushing around you were
rushing towards the back and then slowed as this
started happening Its distracting you You guys
start hearing this cacophony outside as you rush
through the back door You get to the back wall
What are you doing
 You get that door open you guys start
rushing out there you heal up Caleb You come to
consciousness being dragged your feet grinding
 Well the windows are shattered the
explosion
 Make an acrobatics check followed by a
stealth check
 Well you reduce the damage you take by one
die so you only take two points of bludgeoning
damage As you land your ankle twists and you
tumble and roll and get up Whats your stealth
check
 Using the chaos that way and the guards that
are now out in the middle of the street you land
behind them One of them goes to turn in your
direction and you dart behind the wall leap over
the side and arc around to meet the rest of the
party as you all slowly begin to climb over the
back wall where Beau and Molly are waiting for
you
 Running to the sewers Everyone make a
stealth check as youre trying to make your way
through there People are now starting to run back
to their homes you can see people running and
screaming now dressed in full attire for the
gala leaving their masks behind screaming bloody murder
 Okay
 I know thats okay So a couple of bad
rolls but for the most part you guys averaged
okay Thankfully with the chaos and the way you
are dressed you manage to push through and mingle
well it wasnt too hard You make your way
through the town you can see the tower still
being held in place and the two figures that you
saw gliding before As this is happening and
youre rushing through you see a few other bolts
hit a large bolt of lightning grind down in the
distance before eventually they both begin to
peer over and are now looking up and down the
streets As you make your way back towards the
alley over by where the gala is you see a
shadowed figure dart out from behind and a bolt
of lightning strike Theres a detonation of
burned ozone as the figure falls to the ground
smoking
 As you walk over to the figure you see one
of the flying entities floating down You can see
now this robed mage figure with a staff in hand
wearing a large ornamental mantle long grayish
hair is now gliding down in the direction of the
dark figure of the ground
 Male
 Yeah you guys see this as you come
around
 The age roughly from this distance from
what you can see its later Older age s human
if human but you cant quite get the details It
starts shouting One has fallen Find the other
and coasts back off doing a pass looking through
the various streets
 Well the guards have rushed forwards and
grabbed the body and are now dragging it back
towards the tower
 Make a perception check
 Aw 
 All you can see is the cloak The cloak is
blocking most of the body you see a hand behind
thats like a leather gauntlet except for fingers
exposed The fingers appear to be the glove or
design of it are almost like they were dipped in
blue Like theres some sort of a blue tipped
glove as its dragged back Thats all the details
you can make out unfortunately as its being
pulled away off the street The guards are now
swarming people are trying to get back to their
houses People are swarming the gate out of the
TriSpire and the guards are trying to hold them
back calm them down and its nearing a riot at
this point You guys make your way over to the
edge of the sewers begin to look around for a
moment where nobodys watching and one by one
make your way down into the darkness closing it
behind you As you all get down into the quiet of
the underground theres a moment where you can
hear the distant muffling of movement Footsteps
making their way back and forth across the
alleyway other yells and screams information in
the distance far too far away for you to make out
the details of whats being said What do you do
 Caleb at this point you glance down and
youre still clutching in your fingers
 No the paper that Ulog left behind
 Are you guys making your way back
 Youre heading back through the sewers the
direction you came
 Okay
 Barely sneaking away from the insanity of
the district you walk through the darkened sewers
down the same familiar path that you walked to
make your exit coming up on one of the false
junctions where the left side of it is partially
collapsed but the right side continues to where
the Tsection is Beauregard Caleb and Molly and
Jester because you guys all have the higher
passive perceptions you begin to notice this area
where theres no water that drains down the centre
groove of this part you see spatters of liquid
 Well theres no light in here currently
 Dancing Lights open up the area here as you
hit the intersection You see it is dark and red
 It is spatters of blood and as you glance
up right there at the intersection you see a
figure one hand against the wall breathing
heavily You glance towards it and take a moment
as the light globes are now shifting out to light
the space You see a humanoid figure seemingly
male in outline adorned in jet black almost
insectlike leather armour that protrudes in large
sweeping hooks at the joints  the elbow joints
the shoulders A helmet thats formfit black
leather and onyx studs wraps around their head It
looks demonic the brow plate sweeping backwards
into rear facing horns Their other hand is
dangling clutching a cannonballsized
twelvesided dodecahedron shape about that big
that has a handle on each side Its emitting a
dull undulating grey glow
 As you cast Armor of Agathys on yourself
the figure which you now see is the source of the
blood looks heavily wounded and is breathing
heavily The lights now up its head 
turns towards you and you hear a voice say
 Does anybody here speak
Undercommon
 What are the components of that one
 As you begin to make the incantation the
figure pulls their hand away and draws this
horrible gnarlylooking hooked blade from the
sheath and goes  and rushes in towards
you And thats where were going to pick up next
week

 Always trust the porn
 There were a few chances for you guys to see
HighRichter Prucine arriving but you kept
rolling low perception on the outside
 and I was like All right shes going to
get the drop on you guys There were so many
different ways that couldve gone But it made for
an interesting story
 Aw man
 Guys that was awesome well done
 They dont trust people that dont look
trustworthy like you Molly
 All righty guys thank you so much for
watching Well pick this up next week on
Thursday Talks Machina next week on Tuesday about
this episode Look forward to seeing you guys who
are coming to CE Until then have a wonderful
night have a wonderful weekend
and is it Thursday yet Good night


 And welcome back So last we left off the
Mighty Nein had gotten themselves involved in a
number of various factions in the city of Zadash
and decided to buy in to aid the Knights of
Requital in their attempt to get one of the
various powerful lords of the city and the
HighRichter both seemingly corrupt individuals
ousted You had planned forgeries that you were
going to place in their homes at night during an
offsite gala in the TriSpires not too far from
where your breaking and entering was to occur
Bringing Ulog along one of the members of the
Knights of Requital you snuck into Lord Sutans
house managed to avoid a number of the pitfalls
traps and contents within going straight to the
bedroom where you battled the Rug of Smothering
knocking a couple of you out but found within a
couple of interesting items that you gathered and
the wax seal you needed to complete the forgeries
to make this loop come together From there you
immediately went across over to the HighRichters
home You managed to well the two of you
managed to obscure yourselves to look like the
HighRichter and one of her guards went right
into the abode The rest of you met from the
outside and within the interior of the bedroom
you discovered Ulog had found papers that proved
that his wife was innocent and that the
HighRichter was basically making an example out
of her as well as discovering a scroll case that
led to a brief confrontation After placing the
document required you went to leave right as the
HighRichter seemed to have arrived She had a
seemingly confident demeanor as she rung the bell
for her guards and at that moment Ulog
realizing that this was his chance to get
vengeance when no one else was taking a stand
rushed her placed a bead within her mouth that
caused a Fireball to detonate killing them both
destroying most of the torso of the HighRichter
and Ulog together At that point you all began to
radically find a way to flee the window shattered
out from the gable windows at the top floor You
heard the guards trying to bash in the front door
to make their way in After fleeing outside you
heard this strange sound as this large dark
sphere seemed to emerge from the distant Zauber
Spire of the Halls of Erudition It seemed to
collapse in itself causing the base of the tower
to lose structure and it began to tip over
stopping midway seemingly by some sort of force
field holding it in place You watched as two
darkened figures leapt from the tower while two
other ones began to glide off the top of the
tower firing bolts of energy in various forms of
magical attack in their direction Using the
chaos you all fled through the night darkness
back towards the sewers where you came You
managed to watch one of the two dark figures be
slaughtered on the street and be gathered by some
shaded older figure who was one of the flying
mages who was giving chase You all ducked down
into the sewer system and began to notice a trail
of blood amongst the dried sewer run Putting some
lights up ahead of you at this intersection which
you had been previously before you immediately
noticed there was a darkened figure of black
leather armor with various horns and hooks at the
joints chitinous insectlike in its appearance
The creature seemed to notice your presence and
called out in a language you couldnt understand
In an attempt to cast a spell to understand the
language the creature seemed to deem it as an
aggressive stance and then rushed you And thats
where we left off so to begin Id like you all
to roll initiative
 All right so  to 
  All right Lets see here  to 
  to ten
 All right so we have Molly then we have
Caleb and Nott together All right Whos next I
guess I should say Whatd you roll All righty
At the top weve got Jester
 All right So Top of the combat round as
it pulls its jagged blade out of its side and
darts forward in the direction of the group Beau
you actually have the first reaction Seeing this
happen you immediately jump into action and
whats your turn
 Dont have time to react What are you
doing
 You look over at Jester who is holding
Caleb up and is not even paying attention Youre
like Shit
 Its athleticsbased
 All righty So go ahead and make your
athletics check
 You actually beat him Wow That was a five
plus ten on that one That was a  So you wrap
the rope around and immediately its grappled in
place unable to move Although its arms are free
it cannot seem to pull itself away from you So
thats your action thats your attack
 Go for it Roll for an attack
  does not hit You swing and the head
ducks out of the way It swings wide and it glides
against the edge of the leather mask but makes no
impact
 Correct
 All right that ends your turn Beau
 The dark figure arm looking at you and
looking out in the middle of the space
concentrates for a second puts its hand without
the blade in it actually it would be this one
because its righthanded focuses for a second
As it does you watch as this tiny bead of
darkness appears in the center of the area and
expands until a sphere of pitchblack light
completely engulfs this space and none of you can
see into it or past it You are blind within this
sphere and you guys see the whole hallway it
consumes the creature and Beau
 Yep
 Thats going to end its turn That brings us
to Molly
 Okay So if anything comes within range that
you want to attack
 The minute you see something Vicious
Mockery got it Okay all right so you draw your
blade out you take the damage and you prepare
Vicious Mockery Got it All right That ends your
turn Molly Caleb and Nott
 You guys are up on the same turn
 Yeah
 Okay As the globules go in they blink
out
 Did you send all of the globules in there
 Okay The two blink out The two remain
there but the other two you sense that theyre no
longer in existence You have two globes lighting
up the area now Its low light in here
 All right Frumpkin peeks in All right
Cool That ends your turn Nott what are you doing
 You do not sense a reply But for the hell
of it go ahead and make a persuasion
 Okay Good to know
 Perfect Finishing Nott do you want to
move anywhere
 Not in this area no Youd have to get over
here to hide
 There you go Good to know That finishes
Nott and Calebs turn Jester youre up
 You
 Okay Good to know Youre prepping the
spell That ends your turn Fjord youre up
Unless you want to move at all
 Okay good to know Fjord you have Armor of
Agathys on You cast that reactionary last time
so what are you doing
 All right You stop as soon as you come to
the other side As you rush past theres a
 in the darkness
 That is going to be a  to hit
 It did roll very high
 So that is ten points of slashing damage
 But he takes damage back right
 As you run by the blade strikes You manage
to feel it glide off your ice armor and you feel
the blast of ice energy You Beau as youre holding
the rope feel this spray of dark cold and you
wince at it in the darkness
 But that gets you on the other side
 Sure
 Okay You glance over in the area In the
darkness the lights fading at this point but
you have darkvision You dont see any other
figure
 Sure Waiting on the opposite side You got
it All right That brings it up to the top Beau
youre up
 Try and shove you mean
 Well if you have someone grappled you can
pull them at half movement
 This way or this way
 Okay so you manage to push it out of it
right there and youre both outside of the darkness
 Yeah its through the darkness
 Beau thats your movement You still have
an action if you want
 Ill say as you swing he manages to loosen
the grip a little bit and the rope comes a little
bit loose If it attempts to break your grapple
its going to have advantage on it
 At the beginning of its turn its now
grappled up in front of you It pulls its blade
with both of its hands and its head turns back
towards you now that youre the one whos been
pushing it out and it begins to unleash two heavy
strikes against you Thats another  and thats
going to be an 
 Both hit okay
 Thats going to be  points of slashing
damage from the two strikes As the first blade
impacts across the front of Beaus chest theres
this strange grayish flash of energy that seems to
scatter from the impact of the blow and it
congeals off to the side and you watch as this
for lack of a better term a shadow clone of the
creature appears off to the side behind Fjord there
 It looks semicorporeal Its still holding
the blade it has the same armor but its
somewhat translucent and made of this dark grayish
shadow energy
 Also Beau you feel the second blow that
hits you it seems to carve a letter or some kind
of a symbol on your chest as it pulls back and as it
does you feel this burning singe and you look
down Theres this glowing brand on your chest
Its not burned into the skin it appears to be
magically placed but you have a brand on your
chest that you dont recognize
 Thats going to end its turn Molly youre
up
 Yeah youve heard them impact Its just
darkness but you hear yelling and shouting and
then talking back and forth and then Beau taking
damage and this strange shifting of energy in the
distance What are you doing
  You get to the edge of it You can
barely peek out You can continue to move but
itll be your action to continue to move
 Okay good to know
 That is wisdom right
 Thats an 
 Im pretty sure that passes
 The Vicious Mockery seems to be unaffected
by your demonic voice Sorry
 He looks pretty wounded already like
bleeding out the side Its your choice in what
you want to do But hes really powerful but
really hurt That finishes your turn Molly
Caleb Nott whatre you doing
 This way
 Okay sounds good
 All right Jester
 Oh no it hasnt come yet Youre right
 You see Caleb and Jester there and this curl
of darkness
 Yeah you hear all the sounds happening and
the shouting and the impact
 You hear them around that corner Thats all
you know
 Thats as far as you can get with your
movement You could bonus if you want to move
around
 From there you can see your friends You can
see Fjord You can see the creature You can see
the shadow form out of the side You can see Beau
with a hint of Molly poking out of the darkness
 All right go for it Roll for an attack
 A  hits Roll damage
 Okay you watch as it dissipates The impact
hits it and you see it react slightly and then
vanish into vapor
 All right Jester youre up
 It does
 You cast the spell and then hold the very
last moment waiting to release it and then if it
doesnt happen the spell expends Im sorry
 Sure   You can just manage to
see Nott at the corner of it and thats about as
much as you can see The rest of its just
darkness still encompassing the corner
  or  You could get either of those
spaces there if you want to
 Right there all right So now you can see
it but thats your movement and your action
 Does that end your turn
 All right Fjord youre up
 You do have a bonus yeah
 All right Beau its your turn No its
Fjords turn sorry
 You can Go for it roll for an attack
 You are technically on opposite sides so I
would say flanked Id allow it
  That hits Roll damage
 Same damage If you bring it to zero they
go unconscious not bleeding out
  points of damage Whack You swing across
and slam it from the back of its armor and
 you hear this exhale of pain out of its
throat As it hits it spins around and you watch
as that same energy that came out earlier when it
struck Beau the blow that you hit it dissipates
into the same energy and then forms into another
shadow version of it behind you
 Hes taken damage Hes getting hurt hes
hurt pretty bad Does that finish your turn
 All right Top of the round Beau youre
up
 Okay
 Unfortunately you need a feat the Grappler
feat to then pin somebody
 Go for it roll for an attack
 The  does hit
  Nice So as you crack across the head
you watch the helmet slip a little bit You can
see a little bit of the jaw beneath the mask now
and the skin itself has a dark blue purple color
You see white teeth that have pretty prominent
incisors visible
 Youre just shouting yeah
 All right Beau is that the end of your
turn
 All right it is now the creatures turn
The creature is going to swing one strike at Beau
in front
 Disadvantage
 Well you prevented a natural  thats
good So thats 
 Still hits That is
 Ten points of slashing damage
 Beau falls to the ground unconscious The
rope goes loose At which point the creature
turns around towards you Fjord As you focus on
its face you feel this swing from behind as the
shadow version is going to try
 Thats going to be 
 That is nine points of slashing
damage and it vanishes The impact the actual
blow hits and discards itself into the impact of
the blow
 Lets see here Its now going to swing
forward and head over to make a strike at you
  does not hit
 Did you amplify it
 Okay that brings it to 
 Okay that is eight points of slashing
damage
 Thats a constitution saving throw for that
one is it
 Thats a  Whats your DC on that
 Whats your charisma bonus
 All right so your DC with that would be
 So yeah it succeeds It takes halfdamage
You still do damage
 d
 Four points all right
 You see this blast of ice come out as youre
shouting Infernal at it It strikes into the armor
and pierces parts of its shoulder as it 
It goes limp for a certain point you see it flex
angrily Its looking really rough As the attack
hits you another one appears over there
 Eight
 All righty thats going to end its turn
Molly youre up
 Yep
 Thats actually not true
 Its double damage
 Thats both the weapon and the
 As a reaction hes going to use Transpose
Echo and shift over with that guy
 You watch as suddenly theres a shimmy of
shadow energy and he switches places with the
shadow version of himself You end up striking the
shadow thing which is dissipated from the impact
  You do
 Yeah you can flank him actually
 So you strike the one Angrily spin around
and then catch it behind where you see him
appear Filling the spot where his shadow clone
was
 That hits roll damage
 Five points of damage How do you want to do
this
 As you spin the sword around coming down
 you hit across the side of the head and
the body collapses and falls to the ground
unconscious
 The darkness vanishes
 No
 All right so as you all
 Unconscious
 You strip him of everything he has Theres
the armor you pull off theres the blade and the
sheath Theres a pair of dark jagged black boots
that are pretty cool three daggers that are all
hidden in pockets in the armor and a pouch that
is hidden within the plating of the leather armor
that is filled with quite a few coin if you go and
inspect within
 So that gets you  platinum pieces
 Yes
 And  gold pieces
 Ten gold
 No they are standard imperial platinum
 There is also the dodecahedron that is the
slow undulating gray glow that he was holding
before dropping it and rushing towards you
 To which object
 Okay You focus on it for a bit It is
definitely magic
 The magic contained is outside of the
parameters of the spell Youre not entirely
certain what its capable of Theres something
alien about its magic source that your Identify
spell is unable to pierce
 As you focus more and more on it your brain
begins to open up into what feels like space
Endless expanse and it begins to scare you Just
the endless infinity of nothingness and you pull
back and  Oh thats interesting It seems
very powerful whatever it is But you dont know
quite how it works
 Do you want to continue and concentrate on
it
 Okay
 Sure You took the helmet off when you took
the armor off
 The helmet is part of the armor The armor
is very well made With the armor removed you can
see the deep blue somewhat purple colored skin
It resembles actually you if a bit darker
Whitish gray hair that goes just past the
shoulders It was tied up in a tight bun into the
helmet and tumbles past once it was pulled off
Dark elf definitive drow
 Correct what you thought you saw the
fingers dipped in the color was actually just
gloves that didnt have the fingers covered
 It is a male yes
 The more you think on it the more you know
theres more to this device It scares you but
there was something you were close to there
Something you were close to learning Youre not
sure what lies beyond that threshold You keep
thinking on it
 Its up to you
 Okay hes still unconscious Theres blood
curling out the mouth and nose He is beaten
 No Well the main character of the book
was The Julous Dominion was what once ruled the
Marrow Valley
 So yeah So the main character was not
Xhorhasian
 They were a general in the army of Julous
Which was
 Yeah the Julous Dominion Which as during
the conflict before the Dwendalian Empire
conquered it
 Right
 Youre maybe  feet from entrance of where
you came down and youre a few hundred feet from
the way that leads back up into the city of the
Interstead Sprawl
 Make a perception check
 Plus no Okay You look past and you can see
some folks darting back and forth occasionally
across the end of the alleyway Otherwise you just
see the dark shadowed walls and the dark sky
above with the cloud cover No one seems to be
immediately coming towards it for the time being
 Okay It takes a few moments but
eventually he  
 Spits out a bit of blood on to the front of
his chest and the rope and 
  And so youve
cast
 The essence is Stupid empirical scum
Youll get nothing
 Make a Ill say a persuasion check because
you havent technically allied yourself with the
empire entirely though you are part of the
empire You specifically are not part of the
empire You did not grow up here
 His eyes narrow towards you and still bears
the incisor fangs 
 The right eyebrow curls up into a very
confused expression
 
 As youre shoving this pastry into his face
you can see right now he appears demoralized
ready to lash out at the first moments notice
and has seemed to have calmed a bit from the
confusion of the displays in front of him but
doesnt seem to be buying into any of what youre
saying at the moment
 I can understand this

 That is a
 That would be a nine That does not succeed
Okay You watch the eyes gloss over for a second
Wait hold on a second Wheres my Players
Handbook Do you have it real fast
 Here Ill grab this one real fast
 Doublecheck one more thing
 I am trying to confirm One of the racial
traits of the elves if I recall is they have
 Yep Advantage on saving throws on being
charmed
 I do
 Thats going to be a 
 Its eight plus yeah
  Still fails All righty So as the eyes
glass over for a minute the snarling and the
tension in the muscles relax for a minute
 Untie me
 You rushed me and began to assault me
 He keeps looking at you Its ignoring the
rest of them It goes What happened to the
Beacon
 The Beacon It looks around
 Right Its just glancing about
 Yes Very
 We are here to retrieve the Beacon from the
empirical bastards in Zadash We had it I have
it I dont know what happened to my companion
but so far I am successful And I need it
 The beacon is part of our culture The
beacon allows the rebirth
 Of our people
 It doesnt even pay attention to Beau
 The Beacons are sacred I have lived four
lifetimes As long as the Beacons remain me and
my people will live more
 We do
 The souls continue With each rebirth the
memories retain
 What is the intention of the empire
 We live We worship We learn We die We
are reborn until we are perfect
 We find more Beacons
 No That was my companion You see at this
point now as friendly as it has been theres
this look of
I might be saying too much and I dont trust the
most of you still
 Thats all right
 For this mission just the two of us We
had help but
 Out Of the city
 Ive said too much Either kill me or let
me go
 You cannot trust anybody in this city You
cannot trust yourselves Anyone who has not bound
themselves They are the enemy
 Theres a moment of very tightly closed
eyes The jaw clenches as he looks about
 I cannot Our allies in the empire are
short on the list
 That would be an insight check
 Sure
 
 Hes not in a very strong place The charm
spell is
 And give me the beacon
 No
 Sure
  Kind of hard to read on this one
 I will strike you down where you stand and
take it Its too important
 Yeah Ill say Yeah Why not
 
 And youll leave the beacon Free me Give
me the beacon
 You give it back We go our separate ways
I run
 He didnt seem to flinch
 Okay as you pull the cloth up and look the
grey light energy spills out from underneath and
you watch as it looks over and it can see it now
Its eyes go wide and you feel the soft undulating
low hum to it
 Okay you match the tone
 As you do hes like 
 Okay it taps It sounds like youre tapping
some sort of a stone or rock
 No it does not
  This long heavy sigh Hearing all
this conversation and not knowing who to trust
even in spite of your spell Thuron
 Then walk away
 The name itself does have meaning in
Undercommon It is a name
 No The nuance to the word from what you
can best understand is it means blessed second
born is the best I can find the right words for
it
 It was taken from Xhorhas
  Grins and looks up From
your fucking wizards
 I dont know the details
 I was just sent to retrieve it I dont
know all the answers
 By my empress
 You dont know much do you
 Empress Leylas Krynn
 You did
 Question was
 No actually that one is a proper name
 Well the Marrow Valley is in the empire
 You guys are in the Dwendalian Empire
 Xhorhas is to the east of here Its the
wastes to the east of the Ashkeeper Peaks
 He nods slowly
 He stares at you confused
 But you will give me the beacon
 Yeah you returned them
 Okay are you fraying it with your sword
 The 
 The moment the rope breaks
 I know But as you begin to pull you notice
that all this time thats been happening the
ropes in the back have gotten looser and looser
He uses that point to grab the blade and swing
around and pull it up against you Im sorry I
need your help
 Hes not cutting him hes just grabbing
going Im sorry I need your help and is
holding you now against the wall looking at the
rest of you and says Leave me
 He pushes you off
 He rushes over and pushes the cloth off the
beacon real fast picks it up and holds it
 Goes over and starts picking up the armor
 He puts on the armor Puts on the mask Puts
on the leg armor Takes the beacon
 Turns around and darts deeper into the
sewers
 Other shit you have yes
 Yeah
 You hear a shout in the distance
 In the direction that youre traveling
echoing down that way And you see a flash of
firelight torchlight in the distance You hear a
 and the sound of weapons clanging
 Yeah in the direction he went
 And then it goes quiet and you hear voices
say We got him We got him And other voices
and around the corner up ahead you can see a
little bit of torchlight flickering against the
wall
 Okay Hand me the object please The item
sheet
 Doesnt work that way
 All right Theres some other muffled voices
down the way
 Its back to the TriSpires
 You hear footsteps
 You guys manage to head back up into the
TriSpires back into the alleyway As you close
and lock the thing behind a voice in the back of
the alley you guys watch as two crownsguard
approach and go Hey You And both pull their
swords to hold out in front and one guy in the
back a third one arrives with a crossbow up to
you guys and says Hands up weapons
 This would be all of you guys as you got out
of the sewer
 Whats your business
  I will say since it wasnt a
single person Im going to ask for a deception
roll from both of you since you were the first
two to speak up
 Yeah dont get advantage Roll one more
 And you rolled a
 They take a moment Get out were
investigating They move in and they dont take
their arms off of you They get behind you and
move you out of the alley into the street and
begin pushing you guys in the direction of the
outer wall of the TriSpires
 We dont have any information at this time
just get out were still checking Please You
see the tower still listing but held in place
Theres this flickering arcane energy underneath
it that occasionally a wave goes 
thats holding it aloft You can see crownsguards
are now some are shifting in the streets going
and weaving through the buildings and theres a
bunch at the actual exterior wall and they
eventually push you through and lead you into the
central part of the city
 They pushed you away and you guys are now
in the Interstead Sprawl
 No you have not been paid
 Who are the two that are keeping point
leading you guys to the Song and Supper
 Make a perception check please
 Make a perception check
 I did
  okay You catch it first and you
corroborate it As you guys are heading down the
road near the sewer exit where you guys were
previously theres a commotion gathering on the
side of the street
 There is a crowd gathering now and you hear
gasps and people starting to shout
 You can see now crownsguard are coming out
of the sewer and theyre dragging the dead body
of the dark elf that you had seen below and throw
it onto the ground People are like  and
theyre looking at it and some folks are talking
Ive never seen one up close like this Theres
this murmur in the crowd as all about the guards
are like Dont worry dont worry Both of them
are dead Youre safe now thanks to the might and
the trust of the empire The king keeps you safe
 You do see it being held by one of the
guards in one of his hands yeah
 Two of the guards pick the body up and one
of them puts it over his shoulder and all of them
cluster together as the crowd follows them Some
of them are taking sticks and poking at the body
as it goes The guards are like Please stop
no
 Theyre heading in the direction of the
Kings Hall it looks like
 Okay So you move and weave into the crowd
 You push up and look and the body has deep
lacerations all through the torso and back It
looks like they cut him until they were sure he
was dead
 Theyre heading down the street right now
theyre turning the corner heading down to the
main thoroughfare
 You can if you want to
  Okay
 Okay Make an acrobatics check just for the
hell of it Just to see how fast you get up there
  And make a stealth check please
 All right As you dart off onto the rooftop
like Batman you just vanish amongst the night sky
And you
 Okay Make a deception check
 This is as you falling forward Ah and
make a scene
 This is just to see how
 Okay So the guys as you fall in front of
him hes like Please miss move away And two
of the guards rush forward and start picking you
up and shoving you off to the side
 More people are coming out now and gathering
the crowd around to see them pull this dead Crick
through the street Words getting around and
people are
 Okay I will say make a dexterity check if
you dont mind Just a straight dexterity check
  You barely manage toYour foot doesnt
quite reach but your tail does As it scoops
lands
 And you are disguised as
 Okay Okay
 Okay And you catch it The guy starts
getting back up
 He grabs you by the front of your armor and
goes You need to get out of our way
 Okay That guy pushes you off
 He starts looking around the ground
 Okay roll a stealth check because youre
holding a glowing undulating device
 Its like a deep grey
 
 Okay
 You may
 So theres two of them currently
 Whats your spell DC
 Whats your intelligence modifier
 Okay so itd be  would be your spell
DC
 Okay I will say that the two guards that
noticed you leave with the object even though
theyre coming over to be like confused
stuttering They see the other object over there
and they both get confused and look at the two As
theyre standing trying to figure out what to do
they both split One goes for the object over
there one goes for Caleb Hes catching up to you
and goes like Hey Hey Were going to the
Were going to the hall of the king
 Right right Well come on And the two
of you turn around he guides you to turn around
Youre now walking trailing behind
 All right Some other townsfolk are starting
to like walk up to get a look at this object now
that the crownsguard are holding
 So youre off youre behind the group The
large cluster is moving maybe about   feet
ahead of you now You are back when it was
turning onto the main street is where all this
transpired So youre a little bit off past the
corner of where they are Theyre just starting to
curve out of sight And you are walking with the
guard now in that direction slowing down The
other object that you caused the illusion of is
the other way and the guard has about  feet or
so to walk to get to it And hes partway there
and he hasnt quite learned what the scenario is
 Okay
 Whats the saving throw on it
 Is there a saving throw
 Oh all right cool
 Yeah And he is not currently hostile
towards you
 Make a deception check with advantage
 
 As soon as you say that Oh shit Thank
god for Friends
 As soon as you say that blew the hole in the
tower you watch him take an instinctual step
back Right Ill go catch up
 Right He darts ahead looking over his
shoulder as he starts to try and join up with the crowd
 Make another stealth check because theres
other folk now that are coming out and are seeing
this The other guard has just now gotten up to
the illusion
 No Theres the other guard that was paired
with him that went off to go after the illusion
that Nott had created
 What spell is this
 Yeah so as it drifts up in the air the
guard goes Uh Looks around All the about 
or so townsfolk had began to converge to look up
at it Theyre all like Ooh Theyre all
excited looking at it Its definitely distracting
the current group The one guard there is like
Go back Back to everybody Hes starting to
look nervous because he doesnt know why its
lifting up and hes uncertain about whats
happening You make a stealth check Youre only
getting it because theyre distracted by that To
try and duck into the alley unseen
 Youre not quite close enough
 So you duck into the alleyway not sure if
youve been seen All right What are the rest of
you guys doing
 All right
 Right So you guys go behind As you begin
to approach you can see there are two teenage
kids a boy and a girl that are dressed nice
enough Both are like Did you see what he was
holding I want to see it They both go into the
alleyway after Caleb as well
 In this alleyway Theres no immediate door
It looks like theres a solid wall on one side
and an arch that leads into a small walkway that
leads between the buildings If you keep going
then it splits off into a T intersection of
alleyways right or left
 You take a left All right
 So you land and they both go Ah
 Uh uh
 Make an intimidation check With advantage
 With advantage because you just dropped down
from the sky
 Okay The two kids go 
 Its not worth it Come on The girl
 Fine They both turn and walk away
kicking the dirt a little bit
 Perfect
 Okay All right so you guys dart off into
another alleyway You still do hear guards
shifting but you start hearing other people are
talking People are starting to go back to their
homes Theyre whispering to each other Listening
in you hear phrases being said like The citys
on lockdown This is crazy Im supposed to be
leaving tomorrow
 You start hearing whispers about the gala
and like How many people were killed
Oh I heard like  people were murdered 
Serves them right those fucking rich bastards
You know passing conversations
Its now the buzz of the town even this late at
night as people are now either emerging to see
the scene or are returning to their homes seeing
what they have But the crowd has dissipated or
at least the crowd has moved on towards the Kings
Hall and are probably in the process of trying to
figure out what the fuck happened to the object
they were carrying You guys manage to dart off to
the side of the is the eastern end of the
Interstead Sprawl You arent apparently followed
at the moment but youre still holding this
glowing
 Its about that large Its got two handles
on each side It looks like youre carrying a lantern
 All right so at this point now the guard
whos down below has called over like four other
guards and theyre all at the bottom of it Some
of them are getting their crossbows ready to shoot
if it does something
 As it swells and then behinds to drip they
all start backing away The guards start pushing
people away The guy that was originally carrying
it with seven other guards begins to approach
the cluster They have broken off from the
procession with the elf body and theyve now
joined up with the other guard Hes like There
it is Stay back stay back Theyre all
nervously waiting for this thing dripping and
doing nothing and theyre all scared
 It does and theres a brief moment as
everyone holds their breath
 And you hear a couple of local townsfolk go


 The guards all look at each other very
confused
  I dont know It just
flew in the air grew big and then made sauce and
disappeared
 Okay you manage to catch up You dart past
two teenage kids that are cursing to each other
Theyre both like Yeah that woman was such a
bitch as they pass by
 Yeah

 At this point when you guys are discussing
what to do you hear the little Actually well
say largely you dont hear but you see Nott
appear at the cusp of your circle Youve caught
up with the rest of them
 All right so the two of you are making your
way to the Leaky Tap
 Song  Supper right The rest of you guys
are going to the Leaky Tap but finding a box on
the way you said
 At this point its past midnight and most
of the market is closed
 You do still have a glowing beacon in your
hand
 It does cover it up Its a very faint bit
of glow that comes through the fabric but its
enough where it probably wont be noticeable from
a distance
 Its possible None of you are very
wellversed in the ways of blacksmithing or lead
objects so
 Yeah
 Theres no looters no
 No and at this point now the streets are
fairly barren of crownsguard Theyve all aside
from the cluster that you saw moving through
theres a whole bunch at the perimeter gates of
the TriSpire and where they would normally be
posted at the different corners of the streets
they are not
 All right so you two are heading to the
Song and Supper Okay and you guys are heading to
the Leaky Tap All right So you head back While
you guys are heading that direction you head to
the Song and Supper You manage to make your way
there Its still open Its fairly empty on the
inside theres only two patrons that are present
at this hour It seems like the commotion has
drawn most of what clientele would have been in
there at the moment and theres only two patrons
that are both halfway into their cups and pretty
drunk or tired at this point But you look around
and you dont see Dolan you dont see Horris you
dont see Kara
 Yeah there is the general barkeep there
which would be
Clay Owens
 Yeah hes a balding portly gentleman
middle age or so As you walk in he Aye can I
get you something
 All right Crazy night from what Im
hearing
 Aye certainly Here you go
 No No Oh no Ulog was in earlier this
evening
 He was here for a while and then left with
some friends Think Dolan and his boy were in for
a bit They rushed out in a hurry about an hour
ago
 Just the two of them
 No they just up and left Figured they
were done for the evening They looked a bit hurried
 Maybe You could probably go to their home
Thats usually where they practice out of
 Better get there soon then Its kind of
late
 No worries heres your drink He gives
you the shot
 I dont Thatll be a silver
 He goes I uh
 Thank you kindly
 Of course He tucks it away Thank you
 Okay as you guys quietly make your way
towards Dolans house as you approach theres no
light from the inside Make a perception check
both of you
 Nice You both notice there is a quick bit
of movement on the inside even though the lights
are out
 Theres a moment pause and the door opens up
very quickly with just enough space to let you in
Do you go in
 Okay you head inside Its dark in there
but you have your dark vision so you look around
and it looks like Dolan and Horris are both in
there Horris has a candle light with a side hood
thats keeping it contained to a small area Dolan
goes Oh thank god youre okay Were trying
We dont know what to do
 Through the bedroom
 Okay Horris is in the process of taking
things and putting them into a sack They are
basically rapidly
 We cant stay here
 If they trace anything back to us theyre
going to string us up in front of the tower
 Great so now we have a murder on our
hands too
 Horris goes Keep your mouth down
Please
 At this point that doesnt even matter We
cant
 Yes but if there is any chance they can
bring that back to us maybe we leave town for a
short time Maybe just go
 Make a persuasion check
  He goes Youre right we should And
Horris goes No What do you want them to go
ahead and throw us in the dungeon Is that what
you want I understand what youre saying but
none of us knew that the HighRichter was going to
be dead Im sure they have ways of tracing that
back What good And Dolan goes Calm down
Please Maybe hes right maybe they dont have a
way to bring it back If we see this through
Horris takes the satchel and sets it on the table
puts the candle below it and walks up grabs the
side of Dolans shoulders and says I
understand but I dont want to lose you and this
scares the shit out of me They both take a
moment and look at each other Horris looks at you
and says I think youre right Neither of us
know how to talk our way out of the guards if they
come by were not good liars
 Horris nods Okay Then we stay And Dolan
says No I stay Just in case things go wrong I
want you safe and gone If this is to be turned
around Im the one theyre going to look to Im
the one who actually has the political influence
here Im the one who can talk and make a
difference if that is to be done in the next few
days or the next week If you can just for a
while trust me and just leave Is that okay He
looks to you and Horris kind of
Fine but Ill come back soon
 Dolan nods Okay Im good Sorry Horris
I dont need you for this It would be stupid for
both of us should anything go wrong to be taken
swept up by this Okay Trust me
 Shes still out back
 Horris rushes off and opens the back door
 Make an investigation check
 Theres piles of trash that are pushed in
the corner You look through and you dont find
anything that catches your interest
 Of course I dont have Karas but I have
ours and I have Ulogs He left that with us
before he left tonight
 Yes He let you in at this point Horris
brought you in He points over too and you can
see theres a smaller sack and a larger one thats
more of a backpack that seems to the be one that
Ulog left He goes Take them please Thats of
no use to us
At this point Horris is letting
Beauregard in and knowing that its just the two
of you he puts his hand on your shoulder and
says Keep him safe Get him out if you can
please
 I dont know Just out of the city Just
out of the city for a week Thats all I ask
 A cart rolls by and they all get very
quiet
 Maybe Okay
 Invasion Im confused
 Horris slaps the shoulder of Dolan and says
I told you there was something up with that guy
 I just didnt trust him I mean it took a
while for us to be okay with each other but he
was always on edge
 Thats something
 Anywhere I could help change the law of the
town
 Make an insight check
  Hard to read but he seems forthright
 I will Thankfully when all this went
down we were both in the Song and Supper so at
least we have an alibi Ive just never done
something like this before Pardon my nerves You
see his hands are literally shaking and you see
notice now he is very nervous
 I will He goes off to the corner and
pulls out a small glass bottle of liquor He comes
over and him and Horris give a very tight hug to
each other and then separate Dolan sits down
puts the drink on the table Thank you
 Go
 Horris comes with you guys towards the Leaky
Tap You guys make your way to the Leaky Tap
 Okay
 Okay so you will cast
 Oh from Sutans house I got you Yeah
Here you go A sending stone One of two You do
not know where the other one is
 No not that That was a gate stone This is
essentially a means of communicating between two
stones
 You head down into the basement area beneath
the Leaky Tap Once again the guard is pretty
sparse Youll see one guard walk past but their
numbers seem to have been ushered elsewhere in the
city So you make it down there and you take
enough time that you eventually get the lock back
open that you left You head down into basement
Its exactly how you left it
 Make a medicine check
 A seven Hard to tell I mean just looking
at the level of decomposition its been here a while
 Make a medicine check to see if you can
ascertain the creature type
 It definitely doesnt appear to be anything
beyond humanoid The size the shape of the
skeleton its a standard humanoid skeleton but
youre not able to tell anything beyond that
 Thats upstairs
 Okay Make a general survival check to pull
things from the surrounding
 Sure You look at it the job he did and
youre like Yeah I can probably do a little better
 Its fine Essentially you didnt do a
masterful job in completely camouflaging it but
it looks like its the rest of the objects that
looks dusty and left there
 There were some barrels There was an open
crate with nothing in it Its a dusty unused cellar
 So you hide it up and put it off to the
side
 You look in the crate You look inside and
see a fairly rateaten sack of rice grains that
have spilled out
 As well as a lot of rat droppings in the
crate It looks like some of the wood at the
bottom has been chewed through as well
 Anything else guys
 All right
 It is yes Its in the alley
 While this is happening
 Okay As youre holding it there its
strangely warm to the touch The more time you
spend with it holding it there
 Yeah
 Okay Let me see here Okay
 Yep So you head back up into the Leaky Tap
Tavern Theres a handful of patrons a lot of
them are talking or whispering about the events
tonight Talking about The towers still up
there Its crazy The general
conversationhubbub through the room
 Probably in her office
 Okay Who is it
 Um wwhat do you want
 I did not know that My apologies
 No not on me Well
Come back in the morning 
I might have something for you
 No I am busy at the moment
 Everything is just fine
 Im fine Do not worry
 It is currently in use but I can swap it
out How long do you need it for
 Okay then come back in the morning I will
have it cleared out
 Then it will be at use for you
 No
 Im okay
 Okay Its locked
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because you are looking through a tiny little gap
in the floor
 Nine You see theres light in there and you
can see Claudia darting back and forth behind her
desk moving very rapidly and with haste Is
grabbing things and seems to be writing something
feverishly But you dont actually see her you
just see the bottom of her feet moving back and forth
 She stops in the space Um Im
 Everythings fine
 I heard about it
 Make a persuasion check
  The door opens up and you can see
Claudia looking as pristine as ever Hair makeup
everything done perfectly Come in quickly
 Closes the door brings you inside
 I am aware that you and your team were
involved in something this evening Am I correct
 But you are not in any way shape or form
perhaps doing a burglary and job breaking in for
the Knights of Requital yes
 Make a deception check
 She looks at you confused and goes Well
regardless your friends are involved in something
that as a precaution as I have been housing
certain meetings out of friendship with an
individual there is danger that I might be pulled
up in this So I am preparing to sell off the tavern
 It will only draw attention to me
 She walks over and finishes tidying
paperwork on the side
 Make a general charisma roll Just for the
hell of it
 Ten She goes To a friend
  She kneels down at the side of the
room and theres a cloth put over a small table
like an end table and she removes the flowers
from it pulls the cloth off and its a safe
 Out of iron What else would you make a
safe out of
 She pulls out a key and unlocks it brings
out a couple of bags of coin brings out a couple
other bags of something You dont hear any noise
the rustling as she pulls it out Sets them off to
the side looks at you while she does so the whole
time like
 Heres your safe
 Hands it to you Its small Its heavy but
youre pretty strong All right
 Probably
 Well I like you too But thats okay
Dont worry The woman Im selling this to is also
a very good person and a good friend
 Theres a brief pause glances over at the
paperwork on the table
 Lauren Lauren Schvine
 It is
 I appreciate the information I should be
okay
 Good night
 Not a problem
 She watches and waits sees you smiling
arms crossed on the desk patiently waiting
 The door closes behind you and you hear a
 audibly on the other side of the
door So as the rest of you begin to catch up and
gather for the evening were going to take a break

 Be back here in a few minutes to pick up
from that point We do have tonights Wyrmwood
giveaway That went all sorts of weird
interesting ways Oh man
 Not all of them
 Theres a lot of interesting ways that could
have gone All right so we have the black walnut
deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood here Also
apparently comes with a Magic the Gathering pack
These have been in all the boxes so you get a
little gift in there This will go out to one
winner You have to enter Twitch chat starting
now You can only put the word in once or youll
be disqualified but the word tonight is
Threats THREATS Come into the Twitch
chat enter that Once again only unfortunately
available to people in the United States and
Canada excluding Quebec Were trying to figure
out how to fix that in the future but weird laws
in giveaways Anyway well be back here in a few
minutes Much love and well see you soon

 And welcome back Way late on that one
 There you go We have a winner The winner
for this evening is Iraginger Iraginger congratulations
 Well get that box to you ASAP Well done
All right so bringing us back into the game you
all begin to converge back in the Leaky Tap The
party has reassembled aside from you who are
staying down in the basement
 Yes
 As you guys all gather together what do you
do
 Yeah its pretty 
 Its very irony Its like licking a nine
volt battery
 Make an intelligence check Because you are
an alchemist Ill give you advantage on it
 Yep
  Okay yeah This is very definitively
iron Youve tasted iron iron filings and things
of that similar nature and it has the same twinge
to the flavor
 As a note so you guys recall Horris is
with you
 Horris came along with you guys
 Horris is in the room with you
 Well say for the purposes of this the
door now opens to the room and Horris comes in
after a drink to steady his nerves and goes
Hello
 Just for a little bit
 About a week or two until things
 We dont know yet Its just a
precautionary measure
 We have an alibi but if we both stay and
we get found out we both get arrested
 What do you want me to do then
 She who questions everything and offers no
answers What do you want me to do
 I dont blame her either
 As far as Dolan told me yeah
 I can wait until the morning if you dont
mind me crashing with you
 Seriously
 All right Anything else you want to work
out discuss or plan
 Its roughly longsword length It has this
curved hooked edge to it The blade looks like it
would not just slash but tear as it went through
flesh as well Its pretty wickedlooking
 I dont know can you sense magic
 Then you do not know
 They look nice
 You take a moment and you feel alert
 They look functional Theyre similar in
design to the longsword Theyre not quite as
intricate and theyre much simpler They dont
have the same grooves carved into the hilt and
they look like fairly decent daggers for either
stabbing or throwing
 Youre not certain what material theyre
made from Its not the same as the What are you doing
 Its got a great balance
 Yeah the armor you gave back and then was
scooped up by the Crownsguard
 Okay Do you attack him
 Roll for an attack
 You attempt to parry cooly and she hits you
in the right eye
 Pain
 The daggers seem to be simpler in design
Youre not sure if theyre special or not I mean
the only person who can detect magic is not in the
room
 I know
 Go ahead and roll an attack
 Go ahead and roll an attack
  Yeah  It sticks to
the bottom of the sill it doesnt quite hit the
glass it manages to hit its mark and stay there
like a dagger
 Horris isnt in the room anymore
 Gerald Stockholm
 Caleb as youre sitting there talking to
your skull
 The door opens and Nott scuttles in closes
the door behind and comes and joins you
 Which one are you handing him
 Thats right yeah
 Okay The scroll case is a scroll case It
does have a faint magical element to it The
limits of what Identify can
 Id say its about eight by 
 Okay you both back out close the door
 You hear 
 You dont know
 Everyone else make a perception check
please
 You hear a slight shift in the ground
 Exactly
 Everythings messy
 Your room does not no
 A purplish dark fume wafts out
 You back away from it and it dissipates
over the next  or so seconds You keep watch to
see if anybody else notices and it doesnt It
rises up and thankfully by the time it would hit
the roof as a smoke beacon it mostly has
dissipated enough in the sky where it doesnt
cause a column of visible darkness The edge that
youre catching of it the little bit thats
wafting through has this very fine metallic smell
to it almost The brief bit that catches your nostrils
you feel your sinuses open up very abruptly and
like a mouth full of wasabi its like 
Eventually it clears out and you walk inside
 No not a ball of fiery death
 Schmidt is
 It might have been damagedealing
 Unseen Servant
 Oh yeah Schmidt is gone The scroll case is
open
 Both of the scrolls emanate You see within
the scroll case theres now two rolledup scrolls
inside there and they emanate a magical aura The
longsword emanates a magical aura the boots
emanate a magical aura and your satchel is almost
distracting the vibrancy of the magical source
from that object the crystallooking object
 Okay
 Its a longsword
 The daggers are not magic
 They are just base daggers
 Its true
 All right
 All right so As you guys all come to sleep
for the evening first off well consider this
rest the milestone where you all hit level four

 So if you guys have decided on your
adjustments in advance you can do that
 While you guys figure that out if I could
have everybody but Caleb leave the table please
 Just set up your stuff except for your hit
points well roll those when you get back
 Dont roll hit dice Roll hit points when
you come here
 You wont need dice Youre fine
 We did it Totally So as the dark takes your
dreams sleep brings calm brings peace brings
rest Theres a soft hum that seems to radiate
around you A welcoming softness A light not
quite white not quite dark its a grayish
familiar light strangely You feel it pull you
forward through stars The distant night sky You
see beacons of light coast by You
see a dark sphere before you Then theres a flash
of light and youre standing there and youre
holding the object in your hand which you keep
Its welcoming You look into it for a moment and
look ahead and you see yourself And you see
another self And you see another self And a
fourth Caleb and a fifth Caleb and an endless
row of Calebs all slightly different All begin
walking in different directions at once You look
down at the object and back up again and theyre
all gone You see a distant flame flicker You
feel yourself hypnotized by its movement You look
down again at it and theres something wonderful
and ancient about this thing You cant
grasp it Its scale is both too large and too
small The more your mind tries to make sense of
it the more you feel yourself walking in 
different directions at once All those Calebs you
saw before are all within you and theyre all
pulling at different sides and it confuses you It
scares you for a moment but once again you focus
back on this object and the warmth is comforting
You look up again at the stars theyve stopped
passing by Theyre held in place And for the
first time in a long time you feel at peace
Thats the end of your dream All right lets
bring everybody else back in please You wake up
in the cold dark basement of this relatively
unused cellar beneath the Leaky Tap Come to
consciousness with the most restful nights sleep
youve had in a long time it feels almost You
look over at Nott curled up right against your
thigh like a dog asleep Come on in

  All right So first off lets go
ahead and get a roll of hit points here so we have
 We havent done this live on air before
 Thats okay So go ahead and roll As a
general rule I reroll ones for hit points
because nothing sucks more for a character than
leveling up and rolling a one So now two is the
new sucky baseline So go around the table You
are rolling for hit points first Fjord
 d for the warlock yes
 Seven nice
 There you go
 Plus your con modifier yes
 Yeah every level Thats how its always
been
 Caleb d
 Okay
 For you yes I believe its a d
 Nice All righty
 Thats your modifier
 You add the eight to it Yeah it
automatically adds your level up to that Roll yours
 There you go
 No you get con modifier
 Every class gets a con modifier to hit
points
 There you go
 All righty
 Its okay Sometimes you get better rolls
than others
  If you dont roll at least four hit
points you die in your sleep
 If you die in the levelup you die in real
life All right so anyway continuing The hit
points are the main thing and your abilities we
can keep tabs on that if it comes into play and
we can define stuff after the episode tonight But
anyway As you all come to consciousness in the
morning the day is before you What do you wish
to do
 Horris is already awake and looking out the
window and looks nervously
 I mean an escort would be nice just to have
somebody I can work with in case things go bad
 On me  gold
 Its enough to last me a while yeah
 Okay You guys get to get your breakfast
started and such You guys begin to walk heading
southward since that was where the Alfield
suggestion was making your way The general
bustle is still happening Theres still not a lot
of crownsguard on the street corners youre used
to seeing them posted at and as you make your way
towards the southern portion of the Interstead
Sprawl to the southern gate you can see why The
exit gates are swarming with crownsguard The
portcullis is down with the smaller side doors
open and every person who enters and exits is
being interviewed and being checked as to whether
or not theyre allowed to leave It seems that
lockdown is very serious during this
investigation Horris immediately clamps up and
grabs your arm and goes I dont I dont
know
 Okay You both slowly make your way
through that intersection and back and no one
seems to pay much mind Theyre consumed with the
current hustle and bustle at the gate As you guys
are walking back Horris is like Is there another 
way out Is there someone something you know
 No no no
 Okay okay All right As you guys are
getting the rest of your morning on what do you
want to do
 Getting your morning on
 Oh yeah all right
 Damn dude
 You look behind Fjord at this point and in
the doorway is Horris arms crossed biting his
lower lip
 Yes
 I honestly dont We scattered when the
preparations were done to make sure we were far
apart so we couldnt be traced together
 I dont actually
 She says she occasionally works out of that
really terrible bar the Evening
 I dont go there
 Thats true
 The horses are being taken care of The
horses will be fine The manticore head though
thats probably a whole different order of
business
 Oh Excuse me
 No you brought it in the city with you
 Do you know a smuggler
 I can do that Ill lock myself in there
and let me know if anything comes up
 All right Horris gives you a long look
of Ive learned a lot about you in the moment

 Im sure the community is already halfway
there buddy  All right So Horris is
taken care of for the moment Whats the plan
 The Broken Veil
 
 Okay so yes I know what youre talking
about now Thank you for the headsup on that So
the Broken Veil Bluffs is to the far far east
That is where the border of the Dwendalian Empire
and Xhorhas is Its actually where most of the
conflicts happen Its where the garrisons exist
Where most of the army is sent to defend the
Empire in the valley
 You are ready for this shit
 Their
 Bryce was the one that sent you to the Leaky
Tap Bryce is the one that sent you to Claudia
 No
 I think youre going in circles
 I dont recall there
 I was like what did I say about Bryces
sister oh shit
 There you go Once again
 If I did say sister remind me
 The Leaky Nip
 Thats a different establishment

 Caleb
 For the hell of it make an arcana check
 I know
 Fuck okay
 Its fine All right continue
 Its not about not enough its placement
and what you have and where you are So what are
you guys doing
 You find your way there Yannick is inside
currently working on hammering out the edges of a
piece of armor Hello Can I help you
 I mean I certainly can Depends what
youre hoping to have made
 Thats a very curious liking but sure
Ill take it
 Hey Im not judging
 The halfling scratches his temple and goes
Well I mean if youre willing to pay I can make it
 Its going to be a lot of lead and a few
days to make it
 That theres a little more easy 
to put together
 Thats up to you Sure
 Right
 Okay well go ahead and get started on
that there Full cost to you two days work materials
Thatll run you back about one and a half gold
One gold five silver
 All right
 Itll be an additional silver
 All right Come back here in about 
hours Should be good
 I could certainly do my best
 I am but one small halfling so youre
going to have to wait one way or the other
 Sorry
 No worries mate Come back then
 You guy havent said youve split so I
imagine youre all as a group
 My hair went  on that one
 At the moment no It seems to be a common
thing here in the Pentamarket
 Not at the moment
 What are you serious Thats terrifying
 You guys making your way to the
Pentamarket
 Okay Its still early morning relatively
You make your way to the warm welcoming interior
of the Invulnerable Vagrant There are no other
patrons in there You do see across the way one
Pumat Sol is sitting behind the counter with
knitting needles There is one off to the side in
a chair thats currently reading through a book
the small set of glasses on the tip of his wide
nose They both look up and go Why hello there
Thats just a real nice thing to see you this
early in the morning Just about to finish my
breakfast snack so you caught me at a good time
 Not all the time We generally do a cycle
of sunrise to about four hours past sunset Thats
our general scheme that we maintain business
 Beau Well the pleasure is respectfully
mine He reaches out giant hand encompasses your
entire fist
 He puts the book down Takes his glasses
off What can I do for you
 Weve got quite a few here currently
containing items that require shielding
 Yeah
 That can probably be done How big a box
youre looking We got them right around that
there Then we got a bigger one about that there
Then we got one in the back thats a biggie
 All right Let me go ahead and
 Well what the nice lady there is
requesting is a box that is lined with the
material known as lead
 No magical properties Its just really
useful for poisoning yourself if you put food
storage in there poisoning other people if you
store their food in it and keeping at bay the
prying eyes of distant divination magics
 Not a problem
 Well we got this here cloak here on the
wall I think youve already taken a look at it
Thats a pretty protective
 The other one whos knitting is like Yeah
its a pretty penny because thats a pretty item
Goes back to knitting
 That one will run you about  gold
pieces
 We got this nice shield over here that we
just had finished a couple days ago Thats an
enchanted little delightful piece That one is a
little more affordable at about  gold pieces
 The shield itself has the head of two lions
facing away from each other with their claws
extended It has almost a diamond shape Its a
pretty decent size The coloration of it is a
bright gold where the lions are The back of it is
a dull almost graphite metallic with a gold
border around the edge of it Its very pretty
 This one It improves your defenses more
than a normal shield would It instinctively
places the shield in places that might help
protect from incoming blows therefore making you
hard to connect with
  Its a plus one

 The fancy box that youre requesting while
not actually enchanted it is taking away one of
the objects that we keep contained So
respectfully Ill have to charge you the cost of
that one and a replacement but thatll simply put
you back about  gold pieces total
 That is none of your concern
 Your friend is a strange one
 Oh I can entirely understand that
 Thats really impressive
 Actually that is a very doable
enchantment Itll take us a little while but we
can definitely make something like that happen
 About a weeks worth of enchanting time
the cost will put you at about  gold pieces
 We can go ahead and outsource that Yeah
we can make that happen for you couldnt we The
one knitting goes Yeah thats not a problem at
all
 Youre going to pay up for now up front
 Oh the whole lump sum up front
 I appreciate your trust in our ability
Writes up a quick little piece of paper Hands it
to you as a receipt
  gold pieces for the box You wanted two
healing potions Thatll put you back about 
gold pieces for the two
 We got probably another dozen or so more if
you want to buy
 Ten whole platinum All right there 
gold from each of you Thats a healing potion to
each of you
 Yeah We have certainly many number of
various scrolls and scroll types and spells If
thats what youre looking for we can definitely
provide
 Im going to go ahead and doublecheck
here He goes through his ledger Lets see The
very basic ones whether that be cantrips or
stlevel spellcasting those are fairly common
Those will put you back about  to  gold
approximately
 I imagine they could
 No its a regular healing potion Regular
heal If youre going up from there to nd or
rdlevel thosell put you back probably closer
to maybe  gold depending and then it
skyrockets from there
 I mean we have to order them from the
Academy but we can get them in here for you Or
the Halls of Erudition
 The box is presented you pay for that 
gold
 A lead flask Its weird every level the
intelligence gets lower
 While this is happening Pumat picks up the
book again and puts the glasses on and starts
continuing to read
 Make an investigation check
 Right so another  off you  nothing at
the moment Its only been a few days and the
enchantment process andor the coming in of new
objects can take a while to stock back up The
shield is the most recent creation that was
presented Thats the only new one you see Other
than that theres still the pearl theres still
the cloak A few other odds and small wands
 Oh if you want Pumat Prime hes in the
back I can go get him for you
 All right He puts the book down on the
counter glasses off turns around leaves Comes
back in takes the glasses puts them on takes
the book and continues reading while Pumat Prime
comes from the back once again the large set of
goggle glasses on the apron on I was told that
I was requested to greet you with a hello
 Simulacrum Thats the one yeah I know
its a little confusing
 Thats kind of a personal story Lets just
say I didnt get along with my peers at a young
age and found myself wandering Got picked up by
some nice mages that saw some potential Took me
in and helped me hone my craft and helped me set
up a store and here I am in Zadash
 Been running this place for a good 
years
 Thank you
 Sort of They were with the Cerberus
Assembly
 Yeah They really Oh no
 The main person whos been of aid to me is
the Headmaster Oremid Hass who runs the Hall of
Erudition
 Hes the Headmaster of the Hall He
scratches his chin for a second Hes the
Archmage of Cultivation within the Cerberus
Assembly Hes been a real nice beacon of
tutelage Hes a bit rough on the edges and seems
tough but hes a softie Especially when it comes
to small critters Dont tell him I said that
For that one moment you see a look of fear in his eyes
 Maybe I dont know Anyway I got to get
back to work He quickly goes into the back room again
 Dont mention it The one thats reading
off to the sides goes
 Shocking Grasp I know what youre talking
about
 I got it myself Anyone want to see
 All righty I like the gumption He goes
and gives a big old handshake to Beauregard Let
me look that up real fast
 Its an autohit because youre reaching
out to it You immediately grab his giant mitt
and a flash of white light and pain as electricity
rocks through your body You take three points of
lightning damage
 That one will run you  gold pieces
 Hands They look pawsish but yeah
 We can get you a Shield spell Thats a
pretty standard defensive mechanism for those of
the arcane persuasion
 He thumbs through the ledger That one will
cost you about  gold pieces
 All righty there
  gold pieces He sets his book back
down puts his glasses down leaves the room for a
second and is gone for about a minute or so
Comes back with two scrolls and sets them on the
table
 My pleasure
 Anything else you guys require or can you
leave me to my reading
 Its a collection of crazy tales about this
weird fella
 Its The Daring Trials and Tribulations of
Sir Taryon Darrington This guys been all over
the place Its kind of wild

 Oh its got to be fiction  But
its good fiction
 Well let me finish my book before I tell
you too much about it Needless to say hes got
this wild constructlooking friend called Dottie
And apparently according to this thing theres
these powerful folks from over there in TalDorei
that hes been meeting up with that keep messing
up every time they go on an adventure Real thorns
in his side
 I got a collection
 Sure I got this shipped out to me from
Deastok Perhaps if you are in that vicinity see
that you get yourself a copy
 I had never heard of it until this so
probably not that easy to find
 I mean Im not really a book retailer
 That is probably a place to look for a
book
 Not yet
 All right
 You are always welcome any time All of us
are happy to see you come in and spend your
hardearned money
 Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye A little
hand comes out from the curtain in the back
Byebye
 All right so you guys return Do you head
down to the basement
 Its still there
 No the skeleton is still dead
 As hes holding it placing it over the
box theres still that undulating low hum and
grayish glow
 Make an arcana check
 The essence as youre looking at this and
concentrating on this object trying to get a
grasp on it now that you have a good moment to
look at it The school of magic or whatever the
source of the magic is here escapes you It seems
almost beyond or separate than some of the magics
that youve naturally learned through your
acquisition of spells and the pact that you had
made But you dont get the sense that its
extraplanar or anything that would constitute the
same level of danger that you think Caleb is
focused on
 Okay I need you all to roll no Im
kidding

 Well thats a TPK You plop it in the bag
and it vanishes inside the pouch
 The downside is longswords are not
finesse weapons so youd have to use strength
to utilize it
 Yeah well are you proficient with weapons
like a longsword Your weapon proficiencies My
Players Handbook keeps disappearing from me
 Yeah so you could not use a longsword
 These boots are designed in a similar style
as to the armor of the Xhorhasian individual you
had fought
 No not obvious Theyre made of a very dark
brown or black leather with studs and the tops of
them curl up into two spikes at the tip at each
side
 Well you have to make a saving throw
 Is it a wisdom saving throw
 Yep for the next minute your face is
curled up into a Jokerlike smile
 Minus Karas that would have been  gold
 silver and  copper
 So whats the plan
 Okay so you guys are going to the Evening
Nip All right You make your way over to the
familiar dirty small sunken dive bar the same
two beefylooking guards on the outside eyeing you
as you enter You come inside The same two
individuals sitting at the the same booth and the
far table And there lies Clive Binz the dwarf
with the halfburned beard As you enter hes
like Ah good to see you again What can I get
you
 Yeah Clive
 Can I get you anything
 Right Well then Take these gifts with
you He turns around and looks at the rest of
you and steps into the back room
 Do you follow him
 All right You step into the back room of
this dive and as you step inside its a storage
cupboard Theres shelves up there with various
bottles of liquor wine and ale Hes currently
pulling a small chain up on the corner As he
does you watch as a small trap door goes
 it winches up and theres a stairway that
leads down And he goes
 As you all slowly descend down the stairs
it closes behind you You hear a few things
shift over it You descend down the stairway and
you begin to pick up the sound of soft music
Theres a gentle violin playing and a lute or
some sort of small string instrument This
staircase spirals downward onto the left and as
it curves down for about  or so feet its
getting colder just from the subterranean depth
that youre going from the warmer surface
Eventually you hear some voices and some
laughter and a clink of glasses As you curve
down the light gets brighter from around the
corner until suddenly you look into a stoneset
subterranean tavern From floor to ceiling its
about  feet tall You can see there are two
balconies that overlook it from the left side and
one thats barely visible around the corner as
the room opens up to the right of you Theres a
table immediately down from where the spiral
staircase ends and theres a grufflooking fellow
sitting there looking up as you enter He looks
immediately defensive The rest of the people in
there are drinking and not immediately paying
attention As you begin to descend the stairway
who alls going in
 All right You all begin to descend to the
bottom of the stairs Theres maybe about a dozen
or so people in here between the bartender
folks and you can see two people are playing
music on the upper balcony Theres laughter and
discussion and theres a card game at the center
table You see a maroon and dull grey robed person
arrive but their body is covered with a dark
black almost pantherlike fur Their face is
catlike with ears that curl up This is a black
tabaxi that has turned around the corner and
goes Halt friends I do not recognize Lucien
  Youre alive
  Lucien She goes
forward and does a huge hug
 And thats where were going to end
tonights episode

 Well come back to that
Thats a d that doesnt matter
 All righty Well pick up from that point
next week Until then well see some of you guys at
CE in Chicago this weekend Looking forward to
that Well be back on this next Thursday to see
where this goes
  Until then we love you guys Have
a wonderful week and is it Thursday yet Good night

 And welcome back Last we left off the
Mighty Nein had gotten caught up with some
interesting folks the Knights of Requital who
had hoped to help shift the political balance in
the city remove the framing and forging of
equipment of materials and letters some of the
corrupt individuals of the local government They had
gone out into the evening infiltrated a few of
the homes and left this information behind gotten
in a few scuffles leaving one of them the
HighRichter dead and shortly after there was an
attack on the TriSpire What are you looking at
Sam God damn it
 Ill remember this  Noticing there
was seemingly an attack upon the TriSpire by two
Xhorhasian assassintype individuals you met with
one in the sewer trying to escape from being seen
by the local guard during this confrontation and
did battle with a Crick warrior of some kind You
subdued it removed most of its equipment and
conflicted over this strange artifact this beacon
that it was carrying sent it on its way however
it was quickly caught by the guard and killed You
met on the surface the guard that were bringing
the corpse and the object along managed to spirit
away the strange dodecahedron from the grasp of
the town guard and absconded with it You met with
Dolan and Horris whore currently trying to figure
out what to do in case they were somehow
implicated with the events of the evening You
took Horris under your wing promising Dolan that
you would somehow smuggle him out of the city as
its currently on lockdown during this
investigation You all then managed to try and
find some sort of lead on what the next step would
be went toward the Evening Nip apparently to seek
possibly this individual known as The Gentlemen of
which you have heard of previously as Kara one of
the members of the Knights of Requital who had
vanished seemingly had some sort of connection
there So you entered the Evening Nip the rather
dark and strange interior of the small dive bar
gave the previously discovered words the code
words that allowed you entry and were led down a
long spiral staircase beneath the establishment
into a subterranean bar Upon which after
immediately stepping into the space a
blackfurred female tabaxi approached Mollymauk
over here and with a look of recognition said
Lucien and then embraced you And thats where
we left off
 So as you guys all watch this darkfurred
tabaxi giving this big strong hug around
Mollymauks shoulders Pulls away and looks at you
and goes It has been too long two ye
 Two years  Look at you You
grew out your hair
 And you are covered in tattoos
 Of course you these are your friends
now
 Very well As the tabaxi turns around you
can see there is posted right off to the right and
around the corner a hulking figure that has leaned
around the edge that leads into this Lshaped
tavern A hefty muscular ogre that is wearing
patchwork hide armor and holding a giant maul
resting on the ground looks back around the
corner with these beady dark eyes and large
looming jaw with angry broken teeth protruding
from underneath going  Looks at the rest
of you Other folks around are looking a bit
confused at your entry Right immediately to your
left is a table with a roughandtumble looking
cutthroat sitting there eating a sandwich with a
halfdrunken drink whos chewing slowly with this
glare of mistrust in your direction There are two
balconies up above you in the chamber You now get
a better look up at the top there are a number of
individuals posted and some of them appear to be
drinking but there is at least one of them
immediately in your view who has two skulking
looking individuals with long dark cloaks and dark
armor carrying what looks almost like a heavy
crossbow but its a long metal rod Youve only seen
them in use here and there but these are some
sort of a riflelike firearm that are usually
reserved for the armies and Bladegarden and to the
far east of Xhorhas A recently emerging
technology that has been largely guarded within
use of the empire itself
  or so people in this tavern
including the bartender the individual who rushed
to you as you entered and various patrons around
that you can get a quick bead on
 Okay
 Okay which as soon as you say that you
back away and look right behind Fjord as you all
are standing there Theres Yasha
 No right behind you as if she had just come
down the stairs with you
 Well theres people all throughout the
tavern but theres some music playing Theres
two musicians that are in the process of plucking
away at two instruments Everyone seems further in
the chamber rather absorbed in their current
rigmarole but you guys have just stepped down the
stairs You havent left the stairs You are
literally standing right at the entrance of this
tavern and youve all been taken aback by that
encounter the realization that Yasha had followed
you down the stairs and whatever is about to
transpire
 No
 At this point a hand claps and the tabaxi
is now at one of the tables and has shooed off one
of the drinks and goes This way I found a table
for everyone
 Oh too long I apologize for using your
old name Nonagon it is a pleasure to see you again
 Nonagon was what you heard
 No the tabaxi said that
 Basically what was said was Im sorry for
saying your old name Nonagon Was correcting
Lucien to Mollymauk
 You dont know
 Nonagon what happened We watched you
die
 Apparently
  Well that spellspitter
lady from the capital She said you were gone she
took the book and left and her contract said
she was in the right and that we knew better than
to go toe to toe with her and her ilk
 Unfortunately Jurrel met with the axe of
the law shortly after you left us
 Zoran Ottis and Tyffial have all
scattered amongst the empire
 But do you want me to find the others
 I know where Tyffial is
 Shes up in Nogvurot We can travel there
I can send a message and have her come down to us
 Very well Nonagon
 My apologies My name is Cree
 I am a member of the well the family
around how much do they know
 Make a deception check both of you
 Yeah
 Technically All right sure Ill give you
that
 Ill give you that
 Well we were all part of the same order at
one point and we splintered off Luci Nonagon
had a different path in mind for us so we went
north to Shady Creek Run and we started the Tomb
Takers Its just so good to see you
 I should inform the others
 Of course
 The tabaxi curls in a little bit leans over
the table towards you with this big grin and says
Does this mean that it worked
 Theres a look of recognition
 Well he led us away from the original
order They were a bit clouded We had a new path
 Theres a few looks now of the euphoria is
washing away from the face
 He brought us onto a new path yes
 Oh these are all members of The
Gentlemans troupe as am I At which point the
tabaxi Cree turns back and looks and you can
see in the far back right corner of the chamber
there is a long dark mahogany wellcarved table
There you see standing arms crossed a very
muscularlooking goliath female with a very short
leather strap top shaved sides of the head in a
tuft of a mohawk that curls down into a long
ponytail that goes down the back whos glaring in
your direction Sitting beside this burlylooking
goliath you see a highbacked chair with a red
velvet matte Sitting feet crossed up on the table
in a nice long deepblue coat leathergloved
hands light teal skin jetblack hair thats
long just past the shoulders a widows peak in
the center a bit of a dark goatee male figure
standing there hands entwined and crossed
looking at you from across the way with a curious
grin The Gentleman
 We had to find work we didnt know if you
were ever coming back We thought so we had to
move on We knew youd eventually return I just
did not know how long and we had to make ends meet
 Work is fine You hear a  from
The Gentleman So We have company Strangers in
our midst He rights himself in the chair
Please come before me Present yourselves I
want to know who has graced us with their majestic
presence Come come The finger goes up and you
watch as everyone holding the rifles cock them and
point down at you
 Come
 Cree goes
 So you all go and sit Theres a long bench
there on the opposite side of this table where you
can either stand or sit since theres quite a few
of you
 Jester is like I dont know whats going
on Sorry Laura I dont know what the fuck
Jester would do Jester is the most random
character
 As you guys approach you hear this wheezing
laughter Theres the second balcony that was
facing in the direction where you entered As you
look up you can see theres another rifleman
standing and hanging by one arm off the side you
see this crazedlooking young gnome with this big
mound of curly hair and this big chinstrap beard
whos just dangling going 
looking over you all from a distance really
creepily The ogres there still hand on the
maul So Introductions please I think I have
an idea who you are but I want to hear it from
your mouths Please tell me
 I knew it I knew it  Oh this is
a gracious day Very well Welcome to the real
Evening Nip Pleasure to have you each and every
one of you Ive seen you around upstairs
wandering and skulking a bit I didnt know you
were part of this mighty troupe
 Much better down here Speaking of which a
round please The bartender looking a bit
frightened on the side starts filling tankards
All right so What brings such esteemed
adventurers to my pocket of the underworld
 Oh Im sorry They pull the rifles off
you Habit Safety you understand
 So You have my audience
 Interesting I have one question before we
get too deep in this conversation How did you
find your way in here
 Go on
 Demedan gave you this information
 Equally dangerous good to know Remember
that The goliath cracks knuckles All right
so Interesting Now you know the way in Thats
dangerous as weve just made acquaintances and
you now know the direct path into my domain So to
make this a comfortable conversation and possibly
an arrangement going forward that we can all agree
upon I have one small request
 Cree Please The tabaxi who was in the
back goes Yes of course Steps over to the
side of the bar and picks up a small leather
satchel puts it over her shoulder walks up
behind the table opens it and pulls out an
alchemist rack of a bunch of corked vials like
small vials opens it and says I need just
and bear with me please just a small bit of
your blood The reasoning being if I cant trust
you and you cant trust me how am I to know you
arent going to turn me in immediately outside to
the Kings Hall And I need some means in case you
an arrangement with me and then leave town I need
to find you
 Oh that is Crees speciality
 As you pull your hand out Cree does a flick
of the finger and you watch as the blood trails
off on its own like a small serpent of mercury and
just  For a second even though it was a
small wound its bleeding quite a bit and youre
like Uh It makes you a little uncomfortable
and then all of a sudden the blood flow stops The
vial is filled about an inch full then she caps
it Thank you so much
 Its a gift that I learned the same place
where the Nonagons gifts were found
 Lucien
 Next
 Same thing Fills the next vial a strange
almost an arc of crimson finds its way and fills a
secondary tube Theres like twelve tubes there
but shell fill as many as needed for this one
 Goes ahead and acquires the blood from you
Jester goes Me too me too Feeling left out in
the moment gives her blood as well
 No harm will come to you unless you bring
harm to me So this is just a precautionary
measure I appreciate your trust
 With that your blood is taken into a vial
 Your blood is also taken into a vial
 Easy enough to do 
 The blood is drawn into the vial the final
vial is capped Cree closes the satchel places it
on the shoulder and then bows and steps back
paying direct attention to The Gentleman and then
out of the corner of her eye towards you
Fantastic I really appreciate that Youre
getting a closer look now of The Gentleman The
teal skin tone its interesting It looks almost
like hes perpetually sweating Theres moisture
on the outskirts of his skin at all times Theres
the faint hint of whether it be condensation from
the air around or produced internally theres a
general sense of dampness to the skin of this
figure So an arrangement you say First off
just because its fun for me are you believers in
luck
 That destiny is looking out for you Ive
seen enough in my time and have lived in spite of
it all because something wants me here Would you
consider yourselves lucky
 Good Then lets gamble
 Then lets gamble
 I want to know how lucky my investments
are Gambit of Ord Who wishes to face me in this
Who feels the luckiest of your band
 All right Great One pass  gold buyin
If I win youre mine If you win then we can do business
 All right He goes and pulls beneath the
table a satchel of gold Pulls out a handful of
gold and plops it on the table You watch on the
side as the creepy gnomish figure that was hanging
from the balcony earlier leaps down creepy
chuckling comes up and he pulls out a set of
cards and is shuffling them in his hand as he
steps around the side Hes now flanking the right
side of The Gentleman so you have the large
goliath on one side the small creepy gnome on
the other shuffling the cards Hands the deck to
The Gentleman does one final cut sets it down
So whats your name
 Fjord Let us deal Did you put  gold on
the table
 Make an insight check
 Seemed to be above board
 Okay The first cards are dealt out for the
first round This is Gambit of Ord This is
different from The CrickQueens Call This is a
Marquesian card game Roll a d but keep it
hidden to yourself All right So now Im going
to go ahead and raise another  gold 
Onto the table
 Well we deal with quite a large amount of
business
 So you put another  gold
 All right Go ahead and roll a d and keep
that secret alongside that die Do you wish to raise
 I raised first last time Im offering you
the chance to raise if youd like
 Interesting Ill raise another  gold
 Go ahead and roll a d Hes holding his
cards in his hand looks across at you looks all
throughout the room Well Fjord looks like its
time to call
 Puts another  gold on the table
  Very well
 Make an insight check for Jester and you
make an insight check as well since you were both
keeping a close eye on that
  Actually there has been no weirdness
with the cards This is a straight test of luck
 Yeah you dont see anything nothing that
catches you off
 So were now at a pot of  times two 
times two so  gold I believe right  
 and the 
 We started with  and then we raised 
and then raised  so that was  So its 
on the table
  from each of them All right He
presents the dice that he had rolled or the cards
that he had found which is a five a four and a
one A grand total of ten
 As soon as you reveal the cards theres a
 A gasp in the room and The Gentleman his
muscles tense for a second and he goes 
Wellplayed and well earned Take the coin its yours
 Good to know that we have luck on your side
as well Thats very important to me with people I
do business with So  you have some
balls throwing down that change and going into a
game with me I like that So what can our many
gifts and my associates present to you What are
your strengths What are your skills Ive heard
youve done some deeds Ive heard you killed some
terrible creature in the sewers is that
correct
 Right which helped tremendously because we
use the sewers quite often That had become an
issue with some of our transference in the
subterranean sewers of the city And
unfortunately the underworks themselves have been
a bit clogged as of late So thank you for that
And one of our compatriots and he points up to
one of the balconies on the side and you can see
behind the individual that had the rifle you see
Kara the halfelf
 Whos stepping forward ever so slightly
And says One of our compatriots has kept us up
to speed about your infiltrations I have to say
Im impressed
 Not too bad
 Well we are a company that specializes in
the completion of the tasks and trading of things
Perhaps not the most legal Things that are
restricted by the empire That means our skills
are best through speed subterfuge darkness We
dont have the best aside for muscle besides
from well  I do keep Sorah by my side
just in case
 That is the goliath he refers to
 Sorah
 Very good
 Well youve caused enough chaos in the
TriSpire You brought down one of the more
corrupt though strangely uncorruptible from our
end politicians weve seen And from what I hear
Lord Sutan is already in chains 
 Thats fine Well see how long Sutan stays
in there he has his ways Depending on how strong
a case youve left behind and a little finagling
on our end if our partnership grows mutually
beneficial perhaps we could push that over the
edge for him and keep him away for quite some
time Now apparently Ive also heard theyre still
seeking the murderers of the HighRichter
Particularly a purpleskinned tiefling who was
spotted not far from the home that night with
rather ostentatious clothing As well as a
wandering darkskinned youth a woman with
physical capability So that doesnt bode well for
you does it
 Well as seeing as how were friends
now I can say that I could probably make this
investigation go away
  No this is an investigation that
you caused
 No
 My associate was making sure that the
events would transpire in our favor But
nevertheless we were not the orchestrators of The
Knights of Requital
 Oh well many gifts come once weve
established a partnership We become friends now
and I like friendship Thats great thats fine
But I deal in trade mostly So I would like a
favor in kind He leans forwards a bit and you
can see some of the condensation slowly dripping
down the side of the face Making a few spots on
the table
 As you hold a napkin out the eyes catch you
for a second The head turns confused for a second
 About a mile out of the underworks beneath
the city Down the underground river pass that our
shipments to the Ounterloch and Berleben pass
through one of my men noticed a strange wall
uncovered by time We sent a team of our best
infiltrators to see what this was about Within a
purple light and the promise of ancient spoils
seemed to peek from within Some sort of abandoned
research facility from ages past Well my
curiosity got the better of me So we sent the
team inward to seek it out But amongst these few
goldladen objects that enticed my men they are
a superstitious lot and upon being beset by
series of phantom globes they fled and collapsed
the entrance behind them You see him glare past
you and hear the shifting of a few pieces of armor
as three individuals avert their gaze 
So those fucks have failed I would like you to
return to that site for me Find a way in Inquire
within Seek and seeing as how you are so good at
eliminating monstrous beasts clearing the space
of any dangers hostile creatures Return with any
of your findings Do this for me and I will see
that the scent is thrown off you permanently Ill
even let you keep some of the spoils
 Of course By all means Do we have a
deal
 Lets say Ive lived and worked a solid 
years orchestrating the seedy underbelly of this
entire city Ive never been caught Ive never
been arrested and I thrive on a pile of gold and
riches you can only begin to imagine
 Good
 Make an insight check
 I mean hes a shifty individual being by
nature But its hard to get a sense of whether or
not he would be trying to lie
  Little one  you intrigue
me Young greenskin so overtly walking amongst
the nobles above and yet youve kept your throat
That says a lot about you Yes please tell me
what would this trial be you would ask of The
Gentleman
 Cree Fumbles in the pouch and brings out
three of the empty glass vials and hands them
over to you
 Hmm Certainly I feel confident
 Reasonably Id say the alcohol is a bit
more brackish The acid itself is a little more
translucent but you could possibly add a little
bit of alcohol to it
 Youre an alchemist youve dealt with
varying chemicals So Id say given a moment you
could go ahead and match it fairly close sure
 Make a sleight of hand check versus his
perception
  total
 All right you present the vials
  This one is alcohol This one is
alcohol This one is acid And takes the acid
from your grasp and uncorks it and drinks it
 So roll the damage for your acid
 It should be on your break down of your
 I have it here actually
 So yeah roll d
  All right so he 
 downs it but it doesnt seem to have as
much of an effect on him It looks like it hurt
and he takes it The muscles tense a bit the face
twitches as it goes down and it burns But then he
takes the vial and corks it again rolls it across
the table  Does that satisfy your
inquiry
  Good good I like it
 We deal well in secrecy my friend
 Lucien was it
  Very well
 Correct
 The sooner the better because we can begin
opening that line Weve now two weeks and three
shipments lost
 Right this would be Dolans partner
yes
 Hmm
 We specialize in discretion and specialize
in smuggling And specialize in people
 So you do this deed well consider it part
of your gift
 Good very good quiet one Now we have
access to the tunnels Of course well have to
blindfold you to bring you through the underworks
to the tunnel that leads to this underground
river when you decide to leave Just because
theres a lot of secrets down here and were
still building our trust But come back in
whenever youre ready Well be happy to escort
you and send you on your way
 Oh as long as we have our arrangements
 If youve proven yourself trustworthy
enough in the long term perhaps But understand
that this is just a precaution Whos to know
Perhaps things go sour in a few months I want to
make sure you dont double cross me and send the
guard down
 Make an insight check
 Its more that hes lived this long by being
careful And when a bunch of strangers find this
secret pass into his lair he wants to be damn
well sure that he knows where to find you if need be
 I dont know who any of you are outside
this bar
 Dont worry Anyway and he throws his
feet back up on the table  Drinks are on me
until you make your leave
 At the moment it does not appear theres a
weapon immediately on the goliath but as you look
behind in the corner right behind the chair where
The Gentleman sits there looks to be one
heftyass maul A giant chunk of solid metal with
a long handle on it that is resting against the stone
 They like to break things
 Yeah theres three guys Theres the bar in
the chamber Next to that to the right of the
actual bar theres a doorway that opens up into a
storeroom Its underneath the top balcony
Underneath the balcony right next to where the
ogre is posting watch in the center of the tavern
the three of them are sitting off to the side
looking uncomfortable They were sitting earlier
and since all of this happened they stood to
attention and havent found a comfortable moment
to sit down
 Yeah You look over and you see two of them
appear to be human Relatively young probably mid
to late s Scruffylooking One of them has a
darker froy hair thats unkempt and covering
part of his face The other one has very short
cut hair dark complexion brown red Theyre
both wearing darker leathers and cloaks that are
thrown over one shoulder Theyre holding tankards
in their hand and theyre both talking amongst
each other while keeping an eye on you
 The third one appears to be a halfling
female who is sitting in a corner quietly
sipping out of the tankard and looking nervously
around
 Just the two of you approaching
 Oh Make a perception check
 A furcovered tabaxi its hard to make any
details out beyond the fur unfortunately
 The two of you approach the corner Kara is
watching you as you step past and steps back on
the balcony out of sight
 She goes
 As you approach the two gentlemen and the
female halfling they just watch you They dont
engage you verbally at all they just keep an
eye
 He takes it The guy with the larger curly
hair takes it and pours it into his own and sets
it back down Thank you
 Well and the other guy elbows him and
hes like  Shut up
 Look we signed up for this to make quick
money Were good at moving quickly Were good at
seeing whats worthwhile Were good at picking
things out Were not good at dealing with spooky
fucking undead ghost things okay We went in we
went through this path We found a crack in the
wall We kicked it down We went inside There was
a staircase Went up and down Went downstairs it
seemed empty It was confusing We didnt see
anything of interest Went upstairs the
staircase the little spiral staircase and
there was a much larger chamber We started
looking around for anything worthwhile It looked
like it got picked clean long ago Dust
everywhere The more we began to look there was
this cold temperature in the room and eventually
these little lights began to come out of the wall
At first we were curious by them One of them got
really close to Therad over there He suddenly
shocked in a serious jolt And you see him on the
back looking a bit spooked recalling the story
He goes We knew then these whatever the fuck these
things were they werent friends of ours So we got
our shit and we ran We had a small explosive so
we threw it behind us to collapse the wall hoping
that at least it would slow them down We
realized in hindsight that it was pretty stupid
because if they were spectral enough to come out
of the walls they still could have followed us
We got up the river from there We got our boats
and made our way back
 They both look at each other and look at the
halfling The halflings like I wasnt going to
stay behind
 We didnt go into the bottom chamber That
looked ominous enough We stuck to the top one
 Its just a big octagonal dome chamber
Had this faint purpleish glow on the inside 
 Look you can come by and sass me all you
fucking want Ive been here for two years You
newcomers walk in here and think youre all tough
shit You think its so great Go Go in there
Come back
 You think youre tough shit You go take
care of it
 Make an intimidation check
 
  Hes looking over at you You can see
him swallowing hard
 Hey no I understand that Thats great
Looks like you guys are much more wellequipped
for this shit than we are Look Im not saying
were better than you Were better at some
things Youre better at others Thats why
theyre sending you in because we cant fight
fucking ghosts You go for it
 Its stone but sure

 All right
 The guy whos talking to you says Thats
Hannah there Im Louis He pauses for a moment
shakes your hand Now go get this thing
 Okay Cree is still standing by the bar with
the satchel on As you stand up and start
approaching she smiles
 Indeed I can tell you its so good to see
you
 Well you had acquired the tome with the
ritual spell that you required to attempt to reach
the city That lady I dont remember her name
The spell slinger from the capital She came and
oversaw and performed the ritual for you I dont
trust those folk but I trust you and if you
trusted than that was enough for me You gave us
a speech We had a fine meal We all got ready
there in the forest
 She said it would be hard for us to tell
whether or not it worked at first but we went and
checked and you were not breathing For a good
hour you were not breathing and you had gone
cold We knew then that that we had lost you We
checked and Im very attuned to vitals as you
know There was no heartbeat So we waited longer
The sun rose and nothing So as you told us if
anything were to go wrong we had to get rid of
any sign any trace So not far from the Tomb
Taker hideout we buried you and we went our
separate ways She took the tome the mage woman
it was part of the arrangement you had with her
 Make a deception check Youre starting to
get in deep into this now
 Make a perception check
 You start wandering over but theres too
much noise and general din in the chamber around
you to make anything out
 Of course
 Right of course Lucien
 Please please do
 Theres a moment pause and then Cree takes
in the hug too
 Theres a faint purr in the ear and then
you hear the voice whisper Its good to see you
 Me too As you walk away
 Make an insight check
 Yeah Seems forthright
 No its bloody water Its water with a
hint of iron aftertaste
 Glancing around no Other than Kara who
you had spoken with previously nobody else
catches your attention
 No shes not watching you Shes receded
into the top balcony into a chamber behind
 That is correct
 Make a perception check
  As is the nature of a seedy underbelly
there are a lot of individuals who are very
interested in the newcomers that waltzed in made
a deal with their boss and have sat and had a
drink and are talking all sorts of business There
are a number of folks that are slowly creeping in
 Make an insight check
 You dont have to roll deception if youre
not lying
 You go through a door and there is a
switchback stairway that leads to the upper
balcony area and as you head up there it looks
like theres a weapon rack which has a bunch of
weapons set up Karas currently sitting on the
edge of a bench and is sharpening the blades
small daggers and stuff and looks back Oh
Hello Sets it aside Look Im sorry I didnt
mean to deceive anyone but thats my business
 I was keeping some things close to my
chest like Im sure you do
 Look I deceived no one outside of what
you needed to know We got our business done Ive
done nothing wrong
 What do you mean
 Oh the Crick attack on the tower No had
nothing to do with us Were not going to work
with those savage beasts
 Go for it
 That wasnt planned by anyone If anything
it might have saved our asses because it made
what you did small potatoes by comparison Im
thankful it happened but look those things
continue to attack us from the eastern border and
from what little informations coming through
its getting worse with each passing week so the
last thing I want to do is let any more of them
into our backyard
 Look I know my limits Im not some
mastermind I want to make some coin I want to
work with one of my skill sets make the boss
happy I stay mainly within the city I dont want
to deal with any bigger stuff than that Im just
a girl
 Its one of convenience Keeping it short
for you it sure beats pickpocketing in the
streets and being beaten when Im caught
 About eight years
 I worked my way up
 As far as I know yeah Its not good for
business
 Thats true but I dont know his whole
plan per se but business works well when things
are predictable Right And when theres war
involved things get real unpredictable Emotions
are high The amount of armed guard and military
gets high Were forced to skulk in the shadows
until it blows over Last thing we want is for all
this to get any crazier then
 Dolans a good man Hes not caught up in
all this Dont try and mix us up in that right
He doesnt deserve it
 Generally no Most of the folks that work
with the Gentleman and that we work for are
wellpaying because theyre welloff Some of them
arent the most moral either We dont do
anything that hurts the folk that dont deserve
it At least from what I know We dont kill we
dont murder We just move and sell and deal in
various goods that arent perfectly legal
 No
 Right
 Well if I have a friend that makes it high
in the political chain of the city Dolan and I
have the ear of the Gentleman thats a mighty
powerful ally to the underworld without that ally
knowing
 Well theres good money in being the
middleman if this works out To be honest it
sure beats having to shuffle in the shadows I
work better in public anyway Its what I do for
the Gentleman now
 You too Sorry
 Stay safe You know where to find me or at
least ask about me now Looks like were in bed
one way or the other
 All right You join up with the rest of the
crew You guys have all gathered again What would
you like to do
 Thats not me That is just a gift from
the Traveler
 This is why you dont miss a game Laura
 Anyway
 It a dark graphitecolored blade
thats hooked in places and this gradual sharp Its a
longsword so its not the beefy thing youre used
to
 It is a hefty blade What youre used to
this ones a little smaller Its still helpful
but its your call
 I think you could use it with your Hexblade
You can use it twohanded do a d but thats up
to you Its not as hefty or as sentimental as the
one you have
 Its taller than Nott
 No it is over her shoulder and by her
side
 To lay it out the whole room is shaped like
an L Heres the far end and this is the chamber
You guys entered from this side around the corner
the ogres right there The bars up here and
this is where the Gentleman was
 Yeah no problem Boss said its fine
 He has practice Its a little spilled Its
a little messy
 You approach the ogre
 The ogre whos standing roughly ten 
feet tall
 It is a male ogre wearing patchwork hides
and fur over one shoulder large belly rippling
muscle arms the maul held in one hand resting
against the chest Deep angry jaw that has jowls
that swing as it turns its head to look towards
you Both the eyes are dark and beady with a
brown iris you can barely see under the folded
brow As you approach it 
 
 Literally rolled an intelligence check to
see if he got it And did not
 Kutha
 Yeah
 Whats happening  Clawing at the
jaw trying to pull it down
  You do this
 This terrible grinning ogre who seems
confused with the facial muscles not functioning
 Kutha KUTHA
 Kutha You guys make your way back up the
spiral staircase out through the trapdoor in the
back storage room of the Evening Nip exiting past
the bar where Clive Binz sits there waiting with
his half burnscarred dwarven face who gives you
a nod as you exit back into the city now I
believe in the lateafternoon near dusk the sky
grows darker as you proceed onto the next leg of

congrats All right bringing us back into the
game you guys have all reassembled with a moment
of your thoughts on the outside of the Evening
Nip just as the sun has set The oranges and
purples of the sky have taken over with the little
bits that you can see beyond the cloud cover that
still seems to permeate the atmosphere above you
With the recent storm mostly passed it seems at
least the gray skies are clinging as hard as they
can What do you wish to do
 The sun has recently set
 Jester has it yeah inside the backpack
 You left him at the Leaky Tap yeah
 So you guys head back to the Leaky Tap You
head back to your chambers and within the one
room Horris has been very careful As soon as you
open the door Horris immediately grabs the nearby
chair and like gets ready Oh Youve returned
 Sorry just Im a little jumpy How are
things going Hows the search been
 I trust you Yeah
 Okay No thats fine  Thank you I
cant even begin to express my thanks
 Ive been staying in here Ive been
looking out the windows Theres been more guard
activity in the streets It looks like theyre
making their way inward into the city and
beginning to inquire at least from what Ive
seen Thats it Other than that Ive just been
bored and reading this book 
 Yeah
 Eh no
 There arent any pictures
  Anyway
 Oh right
 You can buy cantrip scrolls but not
 Right
 Correct You cannot transcribe cantrips
 Right Yeah it was And paid the
difference
 There you go Always skirting that edge I
lived that life for three years
 Paycheck paycheck paycheck Paycheck Its
gone
 Anyway
 Very well Just tell me what you need from
me or what I should do
 You didnt specify But that seems like it
might be a viable plan
 What
 DMs always here
 Ill step in one of the other rooms Is
there a key I could
 Okay He leaves the room As soon as he
leaves the room Jester goes Okay so tell us
about you Each
 Well find out in a second
 All right all of you who are in the foot
radius its being cast in which would probably
be everybody Youre all staying close on this
Everybody please make charisma saving throw
 Charisma saving throw
 You are the only two that succeeded
Everyone else you have to speak the truth
 Yes You all sense the energy come over you
and for a second youre a little confused by it
 You watch as this large cluster of moisture
all of a sudden solidifies around the outside of
the blade and the blade is now encrusted in
jagged ice shards that just stick out the steam
coming off of it Mist
 I think she was asking Yasha
 As the nature of the spell you know you are
under the effect of it and you can be dodgy if
you need to but its up to you
 Yeah plenty of things that are sharp
 Yeah I mean there are jagged parts of the
wooden frame of the bed
 Okay You watch as this bright vibrant
light billows out of it glowing in the vicinity
similar that youve seen it encase the scimitar
 As far as I can tell yes He did indeed
poop his pants
 Oh that too yes
 Make a religion check
 Oh yeah youve definitely heard of the
Moonweaver
 The Moonweaver is classically more of an
elven deity They are a god over night of
shadows music theres a lot of variations to
what they go over but they are definitely not one
of the approved religions in the empire and is
not considered one of the betrayer gods
classically Is an inspiration for a lot of art in
classic elven history even some modern The
caretaker of evening trysts Has a lot of unique
history to the Moonweaver
 No
 Not at the moment How much do you show
 And also theres only a couple minutes more
left on the spell
 About now the spell has dissipated
 The spells gone
 You can still press her
 You know go ahead and make a religion
check With advantage
 He what
 Yes
 To everybody who was present at the table
and remained within the vicinity at the moment
 Yep
 Yeah youre familiar with these entities
Theyre generally undead orbs that
 That haunt swamps haunt areas where they
seek life force to siphon it and devour it
Theyre willowisps
 All right you guys all turn in
 All right An evenings rest takes you as
you all take a while ruminating on the events of
the day the information acquired and the path
before you You eventually find yourselves to
sleep so you can take your long rests for the
night Are you doing anything with the sword
 Yeah
 The one that you took from Yasha
 Are you
 Not yet Okay Anybody else Anything All
right then As the morning comes to you all wake
up relatively early because you went to bed
relatively early Its shortly after sunrise You
find yourself conscious Some of the first to
really hit the downstairs tavern for breakfast
Food is served drinks are had and the morning and
day is yours What do you wish to do
 You can do it if you want
 Okay So you focus on it and as you lie
there concentrating on it you extend the essence
of whatever pact youve made with this entity into
this weapon As you finally finish the period of
time you hold the blade in front of you and it
vanishes into the pocket
 As you force it to apparate once more in
your grasp and the blade returns it has the same
hooked shape but now this blade is encrusted with
barnacles along the base of it Edges of it have
curved around and water continues to drip off
this It seems to have transferred whatever the
essence of this pact blade is to this one At this
moment you realize whatever weapon you seem to
bond with in this way will carry that same aquatic
essence based on the communion that youve acquired
 Okay
 Classic Beauregard
 Zemnians
 Jester will stay as well There you go
 Oh boy
 All righty So for those of you who are
making your way towards the Pentamarket you
eventually find the outskirts of the Invulnerable
Vagrant You enter the interior and there are two
other individuals that are doing business with two
of the Pumats
 You do not They seem to be just asking
questions and looking about the vicinity
 You do not
 Okay
 So as you enter the chamber and you see the
two Pumats are busy the counter is currently not
helmed and theyre middiscussion but one of them
turns and kind of acknowledges you enter Oh
thats real nice to see you Just relax there a
bit If you need help immediately we can see if
Primes available
 Yasha Thats a wonderful name I cant
help you because Im helping this person but just
hang tight a second Pumat Hell be right with
you
 You see two of them that look identical in
the room
 Something like that Hell be right with
you Turns around
 You hear a couple of heavy footfalls what
sounds like a toppling of some metallic pan that
 like Ah shi hello The
curtain opens and you see one of the Pumats but
with a set of goggles right above the head an
apron on with a bunch of different tools and
various accoutrements stuffed into different
pockets Hey so Im helping someone Who needs help
 Right Now youve been here before Youre
working with the other ones All right Morning
Morning to you Hey can I help you
ASHLEY I just I mean do you have Chinese stars
Throwing stars
 I dont understand what that is
 Oh Are you talking about a dagger or a
dart or something like that
 You can probably go to a blacksmith and get
that made for you I dont really craft things
here from their base components We generally take
them and I enchant them to a better degree I make
generally notsogreat things pretty great
 Yeah And youre catching that Pumat Prime is a
little surlier than the other ones He seems like
hes a little more down to business than the
various versions of him out there
 Ah interesting Youre going to be dealing
with some of the spiritual realm you say
 All right Lets see Pretty sure I got
maybe a vial or two of holy water if thats what
youre looking for Thats not usually my purview
but we keep a couple in stock just in case Let me
see what I can muster Goes ahead and rummages
through in the back You hear more metal and glass
clanking and one box gets shifted off to the side
Ah dang nabbit
 All righty Comes out Ive got two vials
of holy water remaining Those will run you about
 gold pieces apiece if you want them
 Well look at that Its like it was meant
to be Straight up destiny
 Ah well you see funny thing with all of
these adventurers keep coming in and clearing me
out We got maybe two more but you got to give us
time to restock You guys your friends here have
been mighty hungry
 Those will put you back about  gold
pieces apiece since we have the friendly discount
of repeated customers Isnt that right one of
mes One of the Pumats goes Thats correct
Theyve been in here a few times Hes like All
right Great Thank you for looking out there
buddy All right So
 Yep
 Oh youre referring to that protection
cloak Lets see here  Takes it off the
counter checks it Thatll run you back about
 gold pieces
 Well You watch the demeanor shift a
little bit from like the Im busy Like Well
happy to see a big spender coming on first thing
in the morning You start seeing more of the
connection with the other Pumats
 Well might I have your name I dont think
weve had the pleasure personally
 Fjord
 Fjord Tough Pumat Sol Prime And I
believe this is now known as Fjords Cloak
 Youre looking for a discount for the
healing potion
 Make a persuasion check
 I know But hey you never know
  You know what Im not going to lie
Im kind of a fan of the nononsense kind of a
lady So sure Ill throw in a ten gold discount

gold for you for the two
 All righty Here you go
 Okay

my mes is available to help you for the rest of
this
 Yeah no well let them know Thank you so
much Have a wonderful day Its a pleasure to see
you again You too
 Nice to meet you as well big lady He
takes his goggles down Have a good day He
turns around and goes into the back chamber Its
funny him saying big lady because hes huge
Hes bigger than you are He goes into the back
and goes right back to work and you hear another
foot hit the pan Ah I need to aw man
 The ceilings probably about tenfoot
 Hi Sorry about that I was helping a
customer but hes left now Not purchasing
anything So Im happy to help you What can I do
for you
 All righty Well have a wonderful day and
come by whenever you like big spender I saw that
 Coming along fine I think thats part of
what Pumats working on right now
 Ill see what we can do Thank you
 Thank you
 All right Thank you
 Easily enough at the blacksmith for the
sake of brevity here Yeah you can pick up
 For a single dart which is the equivalent
Well say there are darts and there are well say
throwing stars Sure why not Because of the
Archives nearby there probably would be a use
for them Theyre not often called for Its
probably a surprise that somebody wanted to
purchase them but they have about  well say
throwing stars which act as darts for five
copper a piece
 Okay So the transaction completed you have
a bunch of these throwing stars Theyre metallic
Theyre triangular in shape and bladed at the
edges Pretty light
 Sure Go ahead and roll a d
 You throw it towards this post and it
  This horse all of a sudden
bucks and kicks the side of the stable nearby and
you hear the wood crack from the kick All of the
sudden you hear voices of the two stable hands
trying to hold back this horse So its 
throwing stars
 Caleb Molly and Jester actually as you
guys are walking back you notice that there are
now clusters of about three or four crownsguard at
different places that are in the process of asking
questions to people going from place to place and
inquiring
 Right shes not with you Youre right
 Yeah like talking to people asking
questions
 Okay You guys make your way back to The
Leaky Tap There what little Horris had on him a
little bit of change and materials to leave is
ready to go Beau and Jester are propped and ready
as well I assume What do you guys do
 Yes Thank you Thank you Whatever you
need
 Yeah
 Okay Easy enough All right As you guys
make your way towards The Evening Nip Horris is
looking a bit nervous but does look around and
seems genuinely very thankful Hes like
Seriously this means a lot To both me and
Dolan Thank you
 Probably hold on that until we get Well
say for the purposes of this youre pretty close
to The Evening Nip when you do this
 Hes had too much to drink
 You guys enter The Evening Nip Clive is
there at the end Hey Youre a friend with a bag
 All right  He leads you to the
back shoves things off of the latch pulls up the
trapdoor down the stairs and you eventually make
your way back into the tavern below where
Mollymauk is waiting nervously drinking
 Thats okay
 Okay Gotcha All right As you guys head
back down Horris is like I trust you guys I
trust you You make your way down The room is
not as busy as it was last you left Theres maybe
six individuals in there Most of them are the
individuals who were previously posted with rifles
or new individuals also posted with rifles up at
the top There is The Gentleman finishing a meal
at the table with Sorah his bodyguard at the
side Ah I see youve made it He sets the
things down pushes the plate to the side So I
take it this is your contraband
 Very well And you would wish this
smuggling to head where Our cleanest to be fair
our cleanest means of smuggling out would be
actually through the river after you pass through
as that leads us to the northern swamps of
Berleben And that would be probably one of the
safest spaces still easily able to keep him out of
sight and to a safe space out of the Crownsguards watch
 Great Then well wait an hour after your
passage forward and send your contraband on his
way to safety with two individuals to escort him
and lead him to civilization beyond the outskirts
Sound fair
 Very well Take care of him please They
pull the shoulders of Horris back and Horris is
like All right Be safe
 And you know what Kara and well say
Dweez You go ahead and lead them down to the
 Lead them blindfolded of course through
the underworks to docks and send them up the way
to their agreed upon task You see Kara come back
through one of the doors on the steps and behind
you see that creepy gnome from earlier sitting
behind
  Kara goes All right
Well and she pulls a few pieces of cloth It
looks like theyre used to moving individuals
through and they have already prepared blindfolds
in place She passes them out to you and instructs
you all to put on a blindfold and take a hand
 Okay
 Whos at the very front and whos at the
very back of this chain
 Fjord front
 Whos in the back
 Okay whos after Mollymauk
 Jester all right Whos after Jester
 Okay Nott
 So there and we have Frumpkin trailing
behind at the very back So Fjord at the very
front Kara takes your hand and begins pulling
and in the very very back Caleb this tiny gnome
hand grabs your hand and goes  Hold on

 They loop you through the room a few times
to discombobulate you and direction in the
chamber and pull you through in different ways
to prevent you from orienting where you were and
where youre going Eventually youre led through
a doorway you hear some things shift and then
turned around a bit and then led down a ladder
The ladder goes down for about  or so feet
before your feet touch some sort of soft dirt
packed dirttype feeling The sound of the music
and chatter vanishes up ahead and you hear as
soon as you all head down the ladder a latch
close and lock above you
 Your cat managed to actually make a
stealth check
 For Frumpkin
 Five
 As Frumpkins trying to trail behind Dweez
turns and goes  No  and puts a
hand out and grabs Frumpkin by the scruff and
holds Frumpkin up and then throws Frumpkin back
into the bar
 Okay
 Okay Dweez is clutching the back of your
hand and goes 
 
 Okay So you head back down You are led
down a tunnel It weaves a bit You turn to the
right down another tunnel for    feet
 Frumpkin back in
 Right You can see this a bit These are
tight individual tunnels It feels almost like a
mine in the fact that it has occasionally a wood
structure for support between it A lot of it is
packed with earth thats been carved out
Eventually youll split off into two and youll
see what looks to be a small resting chamber with
another set of tables and a bunk You go past
another area and theres occasional torchlight set
up on parts of the wall You can see a couple of
shifty individuals that are in the process of
stacking crates somewhere
 Yeah Theyll walk by you and occasionally
look One of them will stop and inspect and move
on No one seems to fuck with you at the minute
because youre with Kara In fact one of them
seems to get close to you and looks and sees Dweez
and goes  and just moves on You do hear a
noise a strange like 
and you hear  
echoing down the hall You move around one spot
and theres one archway that Frumpkin passes by
looking down and you can see theres a pit and
there are a number of cages set up in there about
four of them that have different creatures
inside Its too lowlit for Frumpkin to really
see from this distance whats in there but one of
them is currently having a bit of a conniption fit
and you see three cloaked figures that are on the
outside One of them is trying to whip elements of
it that are coming at it the other one is trying
to prod it in the sides and its getting agitated
 At this point it smells like wet dirt and
earth Thats about it It smells like a dank
subterranean tunnel As you pass by the creature
smell you can smell hints of dung fresh and old
and some sort of pheromone like a very strong
pheromone thats very unpleasant the scent
Continuing on you move through another tunnel
Another figure walks by and stops as you pass and
watches you as you continue Down another set of
stairs and then eventually the echo begins to
get a little louder Your feet hit wood Frumpkin
can see this as you pass in Youve hit a dock
This is now a natural cavern The moisture catches
you first What was initially a somewhat cavernous
damp has now become very moist and you can hear
the slight sound of a river moving through
Frumpkin can see this too Theres an entire
underground river that is now curving past this
entrance way leading in two different directions
Along this river you can see there are a few
lanterns that are set up with this soft greenish
glow Theyre perpetually burning in certain areas
and are bolted into the rock and stone There on
the side of this dock you can see four different
boats that are currently roped and tied to the
edge there There is a figure sitting on a stool
who is taking a dagger and moving it on the edge
of one of the wooden poles that is on the very
outside end of the dock At this point all of
your blindfolds are removed and youve come to the
end of this part of the journey
 Kara says Sorry about that but you were
respectful Thank you She collects the
blindfolds and Dweez who is still clutching your
hand lets go and goes 
 Kara goes All right Two of these ships
are yours to use Youre heading up that path
there about a mile or so Its with the river
thankfully so the stream will be carrying you
through A set of paddles to each of you Whoever
wants to helm that thats up to you Pay
the change in the texture of the wall on the
lefthand side traveling northward Look for the
small collapse on that end
 Correct Be spry Sometimes some creatures
do find their way living down here so be ready to
move past quickly or find a way to duck them if
you can
 All right Good luck
 Well be fine
 The guy at the edge of the docks sits up and
Kara goes The back two for these folks Let them
go Gentlemans orders He doesnt say anything
just sits up You see the hood thats up he pulls
it back a bit and you can see there is this older
grizzled human with very short gray hair deep
scar across the back of his head that curves off
to the top of where his receding hairline is Its
just been very deepset where the skin dimples
heavily along the edge of the scar Hes got this
very scruffy gray and white beard His heads a
bit sunk into his shoulders He walks over to the
edge and unties each of the boats and hands the
rope to one of you The first one goes to Fjord
and the other one just goes to Beau goes back to
his station and sits down sticks his blade in the
side of the wood and keeps wedging it in there
You get a better look up there and you can see
this wood is splintered to shit on the top This
guy has been over time slowly pushing away at
this wood for whatever amusement he needs to pass
the time down here where hes stationed
 These boats look like theyll fit about four
people each
 So we have Fjord Jester Molly and Beau in
one boat And Yasha and Caleb and Nott in the
other Is that how it is
 Okay
 Two oars on each side yeah
 You guys all get in It rocks a bit as you
all adjust your weight and find a place where the
boat itself isnt listing too far to one side or
the other The river current is pulling it along
so as soon as you step off the last person
holding the rope they immediately start following
the current of the river which is not rapid but
it is moving at a fair speed You all gather
yourselves and follow it down and as you
progress you notice those green lanterns that are
lit only seem to cover the vicinity of that dock
until eventually you are going into a pitch
black cavern
 Hmm
 Youre all alone
 All right so as the orbs
 This one you throw
 This isnt an oil this is water
 Okay roll a d and add your dexterity
modifier
 What are you doing
 Add your dexterity modifier
 It goes right past you hear it 
into the water below
 The chamber seems to shift at times
Sometimes it squeezes in where its just the river
and the edges of the tunnel at about  feet from
side to side
 The ceiling is roughly  feet as well 
to ten feet sometimes it coasts down and becomes a
bit lower It is a natural river so
  Oskar
 As you guys head deeper into the
subterranean tunnels towards your destination
weapons at your side prepared for whatever comes
in the near future
 Were going to go ahead and end tonights
game
 We dont have Laura here Weve had two
episodes that went four plus hours My backs
hurting a little
 Weve been here for three hours
 So yeah before we get too deep into this
well go ahead and pick up next week when Laura
can join us
 Well pick up from there Once again guys
thank you so much for tuning in Check out the
awesomeness of LA and the stuff we are doing
with them Check out Pillars of Eternity  and the
really cool stuff that we are doing with them And
yeah well be back into this next week Until
then guys have a wonderful week we love you and
is it Thursday yet
 Last time we left off The Mighty Nein had
gone towards The Evening Nip where they had
finally crawled into the subterranean hidden
basementtavern where The Gentleman does his
business You had encountered Yasha who joined
back up with the party You had a brief discussion
with this Gentleman which led to a bit of
cardsharkery from Fjords end a fair played
game made quite a bit of money and earned his
favor There you discussed what was to be done
with this new arrangement He took some blood as
it was required of him to make sure that he
could ensure
 Yeah
 You were watching You guys said that you
were possibly looking for furthering some sort of
relationship for business purposes but for now
you had an individual who needed to be smuggled
out He said it would be fine but one favor
requires one in return and to prove yourself both
capable and he had heard some tales of which you
had done within Zadash He requested that you go
and inspect this newly discovered buried ruin
this series of chambers that exists on the
outskirts of their underground river escape
towards Berleben and the Ounterloch You went
ahead and retrieved Horris brought him back He
was then supposedly it seems to be so sent off
and escorted out of the city safely
 They totally killed him They probably
killed him
  You found yourself down towards the
subterranean docks to this river By the way
through all of this Molly was having a mild panic
attack about his story encountering Cree and
apparently being called the name Lucien and
Nonagon
 Upon making your way to the docks you were
given two boats and utilizing them to move further
downstream towards where the exterior of this ruin
was discovered You all gathered your supplies and
by the glowing orbs of Calebs Dancing Lights
ahead of you we left off with you traversing
deeper and deeper down the dark tunnel and river
 Usually I do this just before the game and I
totally forgot to
 Thats what Im here for Thats okay
 So Yasha Caleb Nott and the other ship
was Fjord Jester Beau and Molly
 Heading down the tunnel the two boats the
width of it is just enough to fit both of you and
occasionally you have to pick one or the other as
it begins to pinch a bit and then expand I will
say due to weight unless somebody wants to
actively paddle the boat with Caleb Yasha and
Nott will probably be taking the lead in those
moments
 Each couple of splashing sounds that hit as
the oars hit the water and the occasional crack of
the water against the brook or a rock in the
center you being to maneuver your way through
this dark tunnel with just the low light that
youve been applying It gets colder and colder
the further down the tunnel you go and while it is
moist you begin to see your breath just in
general this low in the ground
 We are too Laura We are too It would
take about a mile journey to get to where they
said this would be so you have a few minutes Is
there anything you guys wish to do prepare
 You have time youre traveling
 Holy water not holy oil
 The only light you have is the light from
Calebs Dancing Lights which hes reupping as
soon as it completes its one minute cycle each
time
 So you guys continue
 continue down the river for a short time
The river splits up for a bit and actually divides
into two tunnels
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because of the low light
 Hard to tell at this distance and its
coming up quickly
 Make a perception check
  It does not appear that the wind is
picking up one way or the other but its
approaching very quickly
 I mean the general sense of ominous dark
future tunnel but theres nothing supernatural
about the darkness ahead of you
 That being what gave them the idea that
thats where this is Thats where the entrance to
this
 You guys are heading east yeah a northeast
path
 So as youre paddling backwards Yasha
adjusts the oar and changes the trajectory of the
boat and heads it toward the left path Do you
follow suit
 Most spastic rowing partner ever Heading
down the water path does pick up a little speed
and seems to dip suddenly before picking up with a
mild splash but you catch yourself
 It slows down a little bit and you start
seeing a few rocks that break the surface and you
have to maneuver around them One you push off
with the oar to make sure that your boat doesnt
strike it Youre not going fast enough to where
it would damage the actual boat but it could list
and get stuck on it if you were to not be careful
You push off thankfully because you both have
light sources here
 Okay it gets just to the very edge of the
oar before it touches bottom
 The oars are about five feet long
 On the water Okay As you reach over the
edge of the boat and slowly lower your tiny goblin
feet across the surface breaking the water water
splashing

 Go ahead and make a general dexterity check
for me please
 Okay
 As youre so entranced by this you glance
down just in time to see one of those stones
thats protruding from the river seems to have
come out of nowhere Before you have a minute to
punch off it hits you across the knee and bruises
the heck out of it Your whole leg starts
throbbing and youre like Ah So your skiing is
now  underneath
 All right it takes you a moment and Caleb
you go and help get Nott up onto the boat but as
you do a little water logged the water splashed
over your face a bit
 Because at that moment the lights go out As
soon as you pull Nott up into the ship theres a
brief moment where Nott breathes and looks back up
with a smile about to say thank you before you
see out of the corner of your eye one of the
stalagmites at the top of the ceiling detach
float down and open up almost like an umbrella
before it lands and collapses on top of Nott
 With advantage because it was with a
surprise attack on that one so that would be a 
to hit Whats your armor class
 All right Nott That is five points of
bludgeoning damage and it is attached to you You
now see a pitch black and gray spined octopustype
creature that looks from the exterior like any
other part of the cavern wall but has these deep
sunk red eyes at the top of its base and its
completely wrapped around the top of Nott and is
currently crushing down on top of her I need you
all to roll initiative
 It doesnt count if its on the floor dude
 There are
 Molly roughly where are you on this board
 All right Fjord and Beau in that order
 You now see this entity has fallen and
latched on to Nott So in that degree
 All right  to 
  to 
  to ten
 Hold on  to ten
 Historically
 All right Ten to five
 Beau at nine
 Wow Molly Jester Thats everybody
right
 And four
 Caleb youre holding up the rear
 First and foremost Fjord youre up
 It has completely attached itself and the
end of its tendrils coming to these pointed hook
protrusions this thick flesh webbing between each
of these tentacles that form the umbrellatype
shape have all engulfed most of Nott and you
hear the muffled  from within
and the little bit of the feet trying desperately
to hold onto the boat and maintain balance
 You do
 Probably not You know what youre doing
 No its enveloped and is currently wrapped
around
 That hits go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points of damage nice Does that end
your turn
 No you do not
 You cannot unfortunately because Well
no because Eldritch Blast is a cantrip so you can
 Yes you can
 Well you would have had to have done that
first
 Correct But next time it gets hit by you
you can add extra damage
 Okay That finishes your go
 Now its their turn Being attached to
there the strange darkmantlelike beast
 It can sure
 Yep There you go strength checks it is
All right
 You watch as it begins to slowly crush
around Nott instead its eyes flash red and you
watch as a familiarlooking orb of blackness
emanates from it completely filling this space
with darkness So at the moment everyone on that
boat is blind
 You can be blinded but you have advantage
on dexterity saving throws against things that you see
 Essentially but a magical darkness that
radiates outside of it Another one going towards
the source of the beam of light that had emitted
and damaged its ally sweeps down towards Fjord and
attempts to go ahead and wrap around
 That is going to be  to hit
 You take five points of bludgeoning damage
as well
 And attaches itself to Fjord yeah
 That brings us to Nott youre up
 You can attempt to You have to make a
strength check to do so
 Yes a strength check
 Yeah thatll do it So you manage to break
free from its grasp
 Yep
 Nope it is just darkness You push it off
of you and you still have nothing before you You
didnt see the darkness emit from it youve just
thrown it off and youre still blind Its a
little off putting to you at the moment
 Okay you throw the creature off whatever
is on you and its just darkness around you You
start reaching out for some sort of sign of
something in your vicinity
 Are you holding an action
 No thats right Thats your turn That
brings us to Beau
  hits roll damage
 Six point of damage to that one all right
Its glomped onto Fjords head the rest of it
pulling and wrapping into the insides of his
armor You hit it just above where you feel the
impact Fjord but its mostly absorbed by the
strange rubbery flesh exterior of this creature
 Thatll hit roll damage
 Nice You clock both this creature and Fjord
across the chin No damage to you Fjord but you
are a bit dizzy from the impact in the darkness
around your face
 Essentially
 Eight damage nice
 After you deck the darkmantle across the
face and Fjord you backhand with a full back fist
blow to the side You see it almost detach and
its looking like its scrambling to hold on That
finishes your turn
 That brings us to Molly
 That hits Roll damage
 As you take the blade and swing you cut
down pretty close to where Fjords head is As you
cleave through the body actually splits revealing
Fjords face As it limply falls off into the
water slinking into the sludge
 That ends your turn Molly
 All righty that brings us to Jester
 No you can just see darkness
 Make a strength check
 Six okay You struggle it doesnt seem to
get purchase Youre confused by this
 Well its a lot going on in the moment and
youre trying to figure out what to do You dont
quite have the gumption to get it catching up
relatively fast So it goes just five feet
 That would be your action on that one
 That ends Jesters turn Yasha youre up
 Well no you have no idea
 You watched as it slip around Nott and
darkness envelop it and thats all you know
 You know the general direction of where it
is
 You are You spend your action to create the
Light cantrip You watch as it flickers for a
second and the darkness consumes the light The
spell has no effect
 Yeah if you want to Well thats an action
to do that technically so you couldnt You used
your action to do the Light cantrip
unfortunately
 So thats your turn
 Okay Caleb youre up
 Thats Scorching Ray for that
 Three attacks
 All at disadvantage because youre blind
  hits
  just hits
 All three hit actually even blinded
  points of damage All together right
Nope It loses concentration on its darkness

 But is still standing You watch as the
darkness flickers out of the way Theres flames
burning around the outside and three giant singe
marks on the outside of its rubbery skin Its
floating in the air there for a second before its
going back in for a swoop against the one who
recently singed it
 All right that ends your turn top of the
round The boats continue further downstream
 Top of the round Fjord its you
 You watch as the moisture from the air and
some of the water droplets from the river from
the splashing of the boat suddenly stick up and
congeal in ice form around the outside of Fjords body
 Correct
 It only takes the d damage when you damage
it
 That ends Fjords turn Another one swoops
down and is going to attempt to envelope the one
that scorched its ally
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 You take nine points of bludgeoning damage
and it is attached to you
 The one that is still existing is going to
attempt to attach to you once again Nott
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 That is a miss
 That ends their go Nott youre up
 Okay go ahead and make an attack with
disadvantage because you are in melee with
another creature The other creature that tried to
grapple you is right up against you So it is
still harrying you when youre trying to fire
 Yeah if she hits
 Ten does not hit unfortunately You attempt
to fire and at the last minute it shifts out of
the way You can see Calebs chest exposed to
where you were aiming and you pull back and fire
wide off into the darkness
 Yes
  does hit You dont get sneak attack
however because this guy is not engaged with
anyone else Go ahead and roll damage
 I dont know if Frumpkin
 Id say for now given the fact that
Frumpkin is in a small boat and the creature is
flying up I would not consider it harrying the
entity enough to grant sneak attack But it
doesnt matter Because that was enough to finish
it off It had already been damaged quite a bit in
the previous round So as you fire your final
crossbolt into that one it   into
the river below You watch as it sink below the
water as your boat begins to scoot by scraping
noise and begins grinding against this center
stone here in the middle of the river Its just
barely making its way around Finishing that
thats the end of Notts turn Beau youre up
 No that one has been slaughtered There is
one on Caleb over there
 It is currently attached to him around his
head yeah
 Nope Theres probably about a ten foot
distance between you and the other boat
 Oh thats right because you got a feat for
it
 So you would not have disadvantage on that
 Well well let you roll damage for Calebs
because it did work
 I forgot that you had gotten that feat Go
for it
 The first one was high the second one was
low
 So with that one moment as Beaus preparing
you manage one blast of the crossbow that strikes
square into one of the eyes of the creature You
hear this this strange guttural pain sound as its
still holding onto Caleb but seems to have taken
a big hit On your turn Beau
 For the purposes of this roll an acrobatics
check This is a more parkour off of the boat
using the weight
 So you jump skip off the ground and
 On the small stone in the center there and
use the momentum from that with the staff
swinging go ahead make your strike against the
 Nine damage With that you manage to slap
that one into two separate pieces that go slapping
and sliding against the wall and splatter and
begin to slick down the side of the cavern exterior
 Your hairs slick back from the blood from
the impact and the wound that gets taken
 Ending Beaus turn Beau Caleb Molly and
Jester you hear this mild rumble and you watch as
from the somewhat rocky outside of the two sides
of the wall these large figures begin to burst
from the exterior and begin to slowly make their
way towards the edge So their action and movement
puts them right up to there and this one moves up
to there
 You see them covered in greenish algae and
vines They look like theyre made of earth and
stone Youre not certain what the nature of what
they are Theyre bottom heavy and crawling across
the ground and pulling their body forward Youre
not even sure if they have feet
 Theyre coming up to the edge of the river
Thats going to end Beaus turn Molly youre up
 Theyre not yet no
 Okay
 Okay Well thats where Jester is
 So youre like Oh Jester still has the
oars in place Does that finish your turn
 All righty Jester your turn
 All right make a strength check please
 Oh shit Jester is power rowing as it begins
to  down the river to about there
 You scoot by The entity gets to the edge of
the water and then watches it pass its body
shifting It looks powerful but it looks
slowmoving
 Perfect That ends Jesters turn Yasha
youre up
 Maneuver around
 Go ahead and make a strength check
 Correct which actually you had to roll a
concentration check for
 All right so it is dark in here Remember
the Dancing Lights is concentration
 No it is now absolutely pitch dark
 Its pitch dark yeah
 Yeah it dispels the Light unfortunately
It doesnt encapsulate it It dispels it So you
begin rowing in the direction in the darkness
Whatd you roll
  Oh yeah Without issue you can row past
and just begin to get beyond your friends there
 Thats going to end Yashas go Caleb
youre up
 Okay a couple lights go up again You guys
go from darkness to immediate light again and
behind you see the two creatures dragging
themselves forward by their upper body
 Okay Top of the round now The water
carries the boats further down
 To about there
 Well say here with the movement of the
creatures actually they cant catch up because
you guys managed to push ahead
 For the purposes of cinematic movement on
this you guys continue to row as hard as you can
looking back with the light pushed towards the
back to give a view They are failing to keep up
with both Yasha and Jester keeping the ships going
at full speed Eventually they both stop and
begin to back up heading back towards the
vicinity where they had originally emerged
disappearing into the shadows and darkness behind
you
 As the sounds of the underground river begin
to fill your senses once more you settle and
listen and the quiet aside from the slow rushing
of the river is all you hear Whos at the front
of each boat keeping an eye out
 Fjord moves to the front of that boat Whos
at the front of the other
 I would like you both to make a perception
check please
  Okay As you guys are moving along
Fjord mildly distracted partially from the mist
that is rising up from the ice and armor
 Caleb you focus off to the side and to the
north side of the riverbank you see a shift in
texture and a mild rock slide Part of the wall
has caved in a bit and is now pushing into part of
the river
 Okay So as you focus on Whats the range
on that one
  feet okay As you guys drift lazily down
the course of the river
 As you move in that direction past the rock
slide you get a faint source of magic further
beyond that rock slide
 You get a better look at it Actually you
dont get a better look because you dont have light
 Thats on the north side of it yes
 Nope Nothing of magical essence on that
side of the chamber
 Those with darkvision get a better view as
they get closer At this point youve gotten
close enough for your magical essence so you get a
view of this Nott You can see on the northern
side of it the cavern wall that has been slowly
shifting through millennia of mineral buildup
changes into bits of solid smooth stone and a
portion of it collapsed into what this rock slide is
 Yasha ignites a torch The fire burns
brightly and the interior of this chamber now is
very easy to see the details around you The water
is still cruising by as you guys begin to make
your way up along the shore a bit stepping off to
the side of the river and pulling the boats up on
the rocks Theyre not going to continue to be
carried down by the stream
 The Gentleman on hard times maybe
 Past about a roughly tenfoot wide portion
of this wall that has fallen in part of the
ceiling has come in and above it is just dirt
Its loose rock and pieces of wellcarved stone
and masonry that have been destroyed apparently
upon exiting whatever was beyond this wall
 You feel it on the opposite the other side
of this rock slide
 Both of you make athletics checks to get
through the endurance of pulling these stones out
of the way
 Yes
 Between the two of you about ten minutes
pass as you watch your two beefy companions one
after another moving large stones and rocks
scooping them out of the way some spilling and
rolling into the water other ones being pushed
off to the side
 Id say about the time it begins to fade
you guys begin to see a faint purple glow through
a breach of this slide leading into the next
chamber Its a very faint pinkish purple light source
 Coming from that room It looks like theres
a room or a chamber beyond
 Youre just starting to expose it a bit All
youre seeing is the light and stone on the
opposite end But there is a gap Theres about a
tenfoot space between where youre starting to
see this and where you see the light reflecting on
whatever this other surface is within About then
your spell fades
 The torch is still up yeah You guys manage
to pull the stones from it the final bits leaving
just enough of a space where you can crawl through
independently You are now looking into the center
of a spiral staircase
 Willowisps generally fade like a dull
yellowgreen color
 Not particularly As you begin to move
beyond you can look up inside this spiral
staircase Above you and about two feet up the
corner there is a wrought iron cage that is built
into the wall containing a small crystallike
stone that is purple in color that is giving off
this light source
 There have been different artifacts that
have been enchanted with equivalents of either
Continuous Flame or a magic that themselves can
emanate light The way its affixed to here it
looks like its designed to be a general light
source
 Essentially yeah Its a purple glow
stick
 Like a small iron cage that is bolted into
the stone
 Okay you have two directions Up or down
 It goes up or down You pull through and
begin to find your way into the spiral staircase
Its about roughly eight or ten feet wide as it
continues downward It also continues upward
Youre entering partway through the staircase
 No no Its closed Theres an actual
column in the center of it so you have to traverse
up or down to get more of a view of where it
leads
 Well no Its just right around the corner
on the edge locked into the central pillar
 Yeah It looks like the edges of the cage
where the metal has been bent
 Its small Its about that big and its
pressed into the stone like the stone was
probably ground into various holes and then the
iron was put in there and then sealed in You
dont know how easy or hard it would be to
remove
 All right What is the marching order
heading downward
 Nott in front Whos after Nott
 Okay Whos after Yasha
 All right Jester after Yasha
 So Beaus at the back keeping an eye open
As you guys slowly step down the stone stairs
deeper and deeper still
 Go ahead and make an investigation check
 Is there a number up top
 Roll it again
 You guys continue down for about  feet or
so very slowly very carefully as Nott inspects
each individual step eyes lurking around looking
for any signs of uneven stone of gaps between the
mason work Nothing catches your attention You
hit the very base of the stairway before it evens
out There is a small intermediate chamber thats
about  feet wide and only about five feet
sorry  feet long and about five feet wide and
then a thin hallway about four or five feet wide
that goes on for about  feet You dont see
anything beyond that There is no light other than
the torch light that you have currently
 So as you exit the stairs
 Its essentially five feet to each way on
the ends
 Its a rusty trombone man You never seen
that
 Yes Yes Nott That is correct It looks to
be five feet to each side of you once you exit the
stairs like a resting space
 And then there is a four to fivefoot wide
shaft that continues forward
 I know Im proud of you
 Congratulations Notts been drinking enough
where shes not entirely certain where things are
or where you are
 Cats generally nocturnal I would say it
would have unless it says in the actual I will
look in the Monster Manual Im fairly certain
having grown up with cats that being nocturnal
creatures theyd have it
 They do not have darkvision according to
the rules
 But they do have perception on vision
 Ten feet ahead of Nott
 Frumpkin darts ahead down that long
foot very thin hallway to the opposite side
and in the next chamber what little bit of
lights making it in there because its pretty
low light based on what little bit of torch is
coming through and its like a lantern light at
this point because only whats coming through
that hallway is then spreading out before you You
see a raised platform about a foot high It looks
triangular in shape in the center of this room
and thats all you can make out with the little
bit of light thats there but the room continues
on about another  or so feet beyond that
entrance before it goes to darkness
 Correct
 Nott are you traveling down the hallway as
well
 All right As you approach the first bit of
that hallway that continues downward you step in
and at that moment you hear this  and
glance over to the right of you as you checked
for traps in the stairs but not the hallway You
glance off to the side and can see a scattering of
holes on each side of the wall about nine or ten
of them at different angles and one of them goes
 You glance over before something comes
firing out at extremely fast lightning speed
towards you
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 You take five points of piercing damage as a
long metal bolt fires out of the hole and sticks
you right in the front of the thigh
 On this trap at this floor point You jump
up and down Make an investigation check if you
want to in the area
 It looks like whatever this trap is the
actual entire stone floor around you is a pressure
plate that Frumpkin did not set off It has not
gone off since youve stepped on it but as youre
investigating and listening closely to the stone
you hear a very slow 
 Okay that is  to hit
 Does not hit This time hearing the arrow
firing out of the side and being ready for it
you duck out of the way and it splinters off and
sparks against the stone
 About ten feet from where you are
 
 Okay go ahead and make a thieves tools
check which is your proficiency bonus plus
dexterity modifier Should be plus six I think
  okay Looking at this central platform
here as you inspect it listening to where its
clicking you listen for the holes that are
clicking Most of these holes are not actually
functional theyre just there to confuse whoever
might notice that theres an issue Only one of
them is active and you listen very closely and
listen for the one thats making the clicking
noise and you quickly take one of your thieves
tools or not your thieves tools something on
you that can plug that hole A piece of stone
something that you might have in your vicinity
that might function to that degree
 
 The holes are about that big
 
 Okay there is a section of the doorknob
that will fit within that hole You jam it in
there and you push and grind it in there until it
feels wedged in the stone and eventually you hear
  and the door knob cracks for a
second and theres no more clicking Apparently
you have managed to break that device
 As you pull the doorknob out
 With disadvantage Oh no thats a  to
hit
 It shoots out anyway but haphazardly and
then it breaks
 You hear a  on the inside of the
wall there and that trap is busted
 Two for investigation
 You guys are all just in the back watching
this happen
 Make an investigation check
 Okay hard to tell at this point
 The chamber youre in right now Looking
around you can see a heavy layer of dust across
the floor and the edges of the wall
 Oh Sorry I thought you were checking for
yourself
 The portion that Frumpkin can see is just
the center platform The center platform looking
on top has a series of symbols on it Looking
close Frumpkin can see they arent symbols that
are drawn on it they are carved in Actually the
triangular shape resembles that The center hole
is the deepest It goes out of sight The other
ones are just mild carvings in the stone
 Yeah you guys are still back waiting for
Nott to finish walking through
 Youre just going to run across
 As youre like Coast is clear Yasha
comes rushing past In the time that its taken
the first trap has reset That is going to be an
 to hit
 Ooh that is  points of piercing damage
as it strikes you in the back of the calf
actually piercing through the muscle and you
stumble for a second You rush past the floor
off Another trap That is going to be a  to hit
 Thats going to be seven piercing damage to
that one This one catches you in the back in the
side of your rib cage under your shoulder blade and
you manage to emerge into the next chamber with
the torch now Wounded
 But you made it through Theyre both
sticking out of you as you turn around and look in
the chamber
 All right As you guys run through its
still resetting Whos going through
 Whos holding up the back
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because youre now outside of the main light The
rest of you rush through making it through the
traps have reset
 Beau takes a moment there Looking around
the corners it looks like this portion of the
chamber is more of an antechamber or something
that leads into the next bit Theres nothing of
worth or interest
 Okay You run to the first chamber It
shoots out towards you Thats cocked Thats
going to be a  to hit
 Misses Just past you The second platform
Notts already disarmed No effect Third
platform Does come shooting out at you That is
going to be a natural 
 Okay Lets see if it works
  points of piercing damage for that one
 
  You catch it and it embeds itself about
an inch into your chest before you pull it out
 You throw the bolt to the ground and
continue on to the chamber You only suffer two
points of damage
 As you guys now have a moment here to take
in the chamber around you Yasha holding the torch
aloft lighting up the vicinity Youre now
standing inside a tall octagonal chamber that
rises up about   feet above you A domed
ceiling with abstract designs and symbols written
in each pieslots of this octagon around
 No
 You see in the center where all of these
triangular pieces of the dome meet in the center
there is a blue thick ten foot wide pillar that
descends about ten feet from the ceiling about 
feet above you Its square and ominously held
aloft
 Below that you see there is that triangular
piece of stone and there is no visible exit to the chamber
 Its raised off the floor about a foot or
so
 For each side its about two and a half
feet
 Its that thing
 The whole chamber would probably be about 
to  feet wide
 From your perspective entering this would
be the front end and theres these two sides
there You have the dome with all these symbols
and strange designs upon each of these eight
pieces of the octagon dome
 What skills are you trained in
 Yes
 Okay What do you have Proficient in
 Well as you look up First off as Yasha
holds the torch up so you can see the symbols
 All of these are from Fjords perspective
 Those are on the ceiling yes
  As you slowly crawl your way around the
exterior checking the stone checking the
placement You do see that each of these symbols
are about maybe half an inch thick into there
except for the centerpiece which you cannot tell
how deep it is The hole in the center goes down
for a while from what you can tell
 Its about two to two and a half feet 
to each side
 Yeah flat on the ground
 You do not see any traps around the interior
of the chamber
 Are you trained in arcana
 I will say because of your monk background
I will allow you to go ahead and attempt it as
well If the two guys trained in arcana as well
are looking up at the symbols and studying them
you are welcome to do so
 If you spend a ki point yes you do
 Those symbols are carved in the ground
Those symbols on the ceiling of each space
 Theyre on the ceiling in each octagonal
piece of the dome theyre painted above in a
circle around
 Okay In the focus of intending to cast the
Detect Magic spell youre not as focused on the
symbols However the two of you keenly
together staring up at the ceiling begin to make
out something similar in these patterns You dont
fully understand it as it comes from whatever
knowledge was imparted upon you from this entity
youve made a pact with You however in studying
various forms of the arcane and coming into
knowledge that isnt your specialty but knowing
it is definitely a specialty you look at each of
these symbols and these are not classically used
theyre improvised interpretations or specific
retoolings of the symbols that mean each of the
eight schools of magic Between Fjord and Beau
you guys get to make out what each of these
symbols means
 You can give it a shot if you want to
 It does not shift at all
 Currently no
 Okay
 Okay you step onto the platform A moment
passes Two No effect
 You can although in the light source
Yashas currently holding it just looks like shadow
 Okay you take the torch and hold it over to
give you a better glance over it The hole
descends about a foot and a half and stops
 Right Its roughly a half inch wide so
about that wide
 Fits inside
 Solid walls on the inside
 Correct It is just flush and set in the
ground
 Make a perception check
 Glancing up at it the pillar itself comes
down in a squareshape and the very base of it
has a slight curvature or dome to it but it is
solid You dont see any seams in it you dont
see any marking It is just a solid pillar Its
about ten feet wide or so
 At this point yeah as they began to look
around You said youre searching for anything
else in the chamber
 Make an investigation check
 As you begin to slowly make your way around
the room looking for any markings
 The hole is like a halfinch wide
 You spend a little while looking for any
signs of grooves or where anythings hidden The
chamber is solid and there is nothing in the room
that looks like it would theres nothing to grab
on to There are no other objects in here Its
fairly empty aside from this dome that octagonal
shape and this small engraving on the ground and
that pillar at the top
 No this chamber is far further below Its
 feet below where you guys initially came
through so whatever you sensed earlier would have
been near where you entered
 It was probably the glow stick yeah
 Nope One big chamber with no other exit
beyond the hallway you entered from
 Go for it
 Oh yeah The next trap you come up to you
leap up onto the side using your fingers to dig
into some of the holes there and jam about three
ball bearings into the one hole that you see is
the one where the bolt is actually embedded
within and as soon as you step back down you
hear this grinding noise and the trap is pretty
shattered from the inside
  The middle one is still broken Theres
only three platforms youve seen that actually
lead to this trap Youve broken two of them The
third and final one you go to attempt to put the
ball bearing in there
 However it does shoot forth through your
thumb Thats going to be a  to hit
 You take eight points of piercing damage
 Actually it goes through your thumb and
into your hand and into your wrist and so youre
bolted through there and its sticking out right
there and youre like  The shock
hits you you dont feel the pain yet youre
looking at it jutting through your hand
 Okay go for it Roll one more time
 Youre having a hard time breaking it You
hear the clicking going and youre putting the
ball bearings and they keep slipping back out
and you cant find the right way to keep it in
You have too much pain from your hand
  Another one fires out towards you
Thats going to be a  to hit
 So you duck out of the way You attempt to
jam it back in
 Angrily with your one good hand you take a
handful of bearings and jam them inside holding
your wrist there as you can feel the 
inside and then a spring breaks somewhere beneath
the stone All three traps have been disabled
 As youre bleeding profusely from your
wounded hand you guys head up the stairway
 Him Its your pet
 Marching order heading upstairs
 Yashas in the back with Frumpkin up ahead
Perfect As you guys progress spiraling up the
staircase you come by the glowing purple orb
thats embedded in the wall and youre helping
Caleb come up the stairs vision currently focused
through Frumpkin Frumpkin heads above curling
upward another  or so feet above where you
entered so  feet above spiraling where this
base floor you had already inspected was
Eventually it emerges into a fairly wide
squarelooking chamber
 All right Frumpkin emerges and looks
inside Its a Baroquestyle grand chamber with
intricate designs and a beautiful interior The
floor itself is solid marble squares that are
offcolor to each other and give almost a
checkered pattern to it Against each wall the
walls are carved to be beautifully intricate with
halfpillars carved out of them and parts that
are inset with art pieces once were set but are
gone There are shelves in places in here where
things of worth were once set but have already
been taken The opposite side of the room by the
way has completely fallen in This chamber should
be about  feet across but it looks like
something has happened and caused it to collapse
inward and the chamber is slightly tilted to one
side Theres a slight tilt a decline towards the
lefthand side of the chamber There are two
loadbearing pillars that mark the center of the
chamber that lead up to the ceiling and the
ceiling itself is about  feet up similar height
to the previous chamber you were in Make a
perception check for Frumpkin
 With the low light in the chamber its hard
to make out any of specific details beyond that
but this is what you can see The collapsed
opposite side of the chamber that has fallen in
and there is rubble and stone and earth that has
filled the opposite side of the chamber There is
the nice marble floor and the designs and carvings
in the sides of it
 It just opens up The spiral staircase just
emerges into that chamber
 You guys are about   feet behind
Frumpkin yeah
 Youre getting close to the tip of it to
the end of it
 So what are you doing
 Nothing in the vicinity of the spiral
staircase no
 Okay
 Level one
 Seven points for Nott Okay cool
 Are you guys staying in the staircase or are
you emerging into the chamber
 So you all begin to make your way inside
this chamber
 Nothing arcane in nature that catches your
attention immediately in a  foot distance Are
you heading into the chamber
 Okay Behind Beau at the entrance way you
dont feel any arcane presence The rest of you
begin to push past and make your way into the
chamber And once again you see
 Thatd be perception checks from both you
guys With Yashas torch and the globes you have
there you dont have disadvantage
 Natural  You
 Okay you notice a couple things
 One there is a relief in the center of the
chamber right before the wall collapse covers the
floor built into the marble It resembles two
faces and one body in the center Like one torso
leads into two faces that look upward Their eyes
are gone theres circular empty sockets where the
faces are and their emotionless expressions
looking upward Very thinly carved into the ground
 Yeah Looking from above you can see it but
looking from the side it looks very strange
because its a very flat carving You see that in
the center ahead in the chamber
 No theyre looking straight up Theres two
sockets to each and theyre empty
 Yes Deadless Deadlifts yes theyre
looking up from the deadlifts its
 You do look to the right and left hand sides
of the chamber you can see all the shelves and
inset areas where artwork would have been placed
You do see two upside down acornstyle alcoves
that are mirroring each other on each side of the
chamber
 From this distance you cant see Theyre
open Theyre maybe about a foot tall and empty in
the inside With the light source you have at the
moment you cant see anything inside of them
Looking above you you do see a set of chains that
are hanging from the ceiling that appear to be
affixed to some sort of red clay urn or vase that
is dangling above
 Looking across the way in the rubble
because you rolled a natural  you see a faint
glimmer of something metallic that catches the
light of the torch occasionally as Yasha moves
back and forth
 Okay It looks to be some sort of vase or
urn that is dangling from chains about  feet up
 Its about that tall The full container
Its like a reddish clay color to it It looks
fairly well made but nothing ornamental per se
Its dangling from a chain on each side The light
lifts around it to inspect and reveal its
coloration
 About a foot foot and a half Theres not
much distance Its affixed to the ceiling right there
 Theres no dome in here
 Youre starting to enter the chamber and
there is no ceiling shapes or anything that
resemble the previous chamber you were in It
comes to a there is a slight curve to where the
 Correct and the two alcoves in the sides
the two pillars that are load bearing in the
center of the chamber
 Correct It is dangling from the ceiling
 Just two chains from the ceiling that are
holding it in place
 Okay Fjord you walk through the relief on
the ground ahead of you And there is that weird
source of metallic reflection that Beau had
seen from across the way
 Okay In the final throes of the spell the
source of that metallic shine does give a faint
arcane magical aura before the spell fades
 For that one It would be abjuration
 The alcoves
 Okay You head over to the side alcove Make
an investigation check
  You glance up inside its about three
and a half feet off the ground and you have to
climb and scurry up with your small goblin body
Looking inside there is another clay urn of the
same red color thats set about a foot and a half
inside
 The other alcove also contains a similar
clay
 As you approach you can see buried in some
of the rubble a long brass or bronze rod of some
kind You only see about a foot of it sticking out
from under the rubble
 You get a little closer and look down at it
It looks like it would be about a half inch in
diameter yeah
 On the ground Theres nothing directly
below it
 You walk up to the faces
 You go over and sit over it and you can see
a well carved robed figure Male on one side and
female on the other but the same features Like
two sides of the same coin Similar hairstyle No
coloration to it but a white marble relief on the
ground The torsos merge and extend on the two
sides and they both sort of look up with the
emotionless face And where the eyes are they are
vacant circular holes about that big
 As you get closer and look where the holes
are vacant its only about maybe a quarter inch deep
 So they dont go fully below theyre like a
quarter of an inch deep
 You come towards the urn You have to pull
it out slightly to look into it because the
interior is too hard to see from this point
 Okay
 Sure You take your sword and wedge it out
It shifts forward a little bit and you look
inside It looks like there is ash in the urn
Its only about halfway full Make a perception check
 All you see is ash inside the urn
 Sure start shifting some of the rock Make
a strength check This would be athletics to do
this Athletics sorry
 Okay You start shifting and pull the rocks
off The rod begins to coil You start moving it
and you pull and manage to pull it free from the
stone Some of the rocks falling down and
stumbling to the side You pull out a four and a
half foot long rod that is straight towards the
bottom for about a foot and then is in a tight
coil to the very top where there is a small
metallic knob at the very top You pull it forth
and it vibrates a little from the impact of
pulling it out from under the stone and then it
comes to still in your hand
 A little bit very faintly
 No
 You start swinging it It makes a air
whipping sound as you swing it around
 Okay As you go to look in the other urn
you glance over at the urn that Yasha was turned
away from and you see this glowing fire emerge
from the urn in her direction Just this small
glowing orb begin to shift out of the urn right
towards her back
 You are You get to make an attack
 Go for it
 Go for it
 Oh shit And that is a  against you Yasha
 Okay do your damage
 No saving throw but you do take  points
of lightning damage
  points of damage All right
 So you actually take no damage because he
was holding his reaction and as soon as it
emerges he fires You watch as the orb
dissipates The faint little motes of energy
shift and vanish on the outside of the urn
 You watch as another one begins to slowly
emerge and another begins to emerge from the
ceiling I need you all roll initiative
 You got Yasha off to this side going this
way Nott youre not too far from there Molly
you were off to the opposite side to look to the
other edge Caleb where were you
 Thats right So you were over by Yasha
Fjord you were over by where you found the
object Frumpkin was 
 Okay And then Beau and Jester where are
you placed
 Right So that would be this relief right
here by Fjords All righty And you watch as
Molly actually Molly was making his way over
there as this happened And that one emerged
 Another one shifts out of the urn that you
just had one emerge from
 That Nott has destroyed It dissipated then
the small motes  back into the urn
 So going for initiative here folks  to

 Oh wow all right So we have Nott and Beau
All right  to fifteen
  We got Fjord All righty  to ten
 Jester and Yasha All righty Ten to five
 Oh Caleb
 All right the willowisps rolled a  for
initiative
 Yes That is the entrance where you walked
in from
 So for their turn they vanish temporarily
 You would know this but its different from
story to story Its not necessarily the case
here So the three willowisps come back into
visual range and ones going to be attacking
Molly one against Nott and one against Beau
 The one against Beau is going to be thats
a nine
 Thats a miss on you It goes wide Theres
going to be one attacking you Molly That is
going to be an  to hit
 That is eight points of lightning damage
against you Against you Nott that is a  to
hit You take  points of lightning damage As
these willowisps reach out and strike you
theres a burst of energy as electricity
strangely like undead lifesucking energy
electricity begins to shoot through your body You
feel your muscles tense your teeth and your jaw
clench And you break away and regain composure
for a moment but they seriously hurt you with a
brief gliding by your essence For the rest of
their movement this one is going to shift around
this way This one is going to go ahead and shift
this way This one is going to go ahead and move
right there to melee move Fjord All right first
up we have Nott and Beau
 It is yes
  Does not hit unfortunately You fire
towards and it  just dodges out
of the way completely avoids the bolt as it
ricochets off the stonework in the distance
  It manages to arc out of the way of the
other one Both bolts go wide from where its
position is striking the stone No effect
 Nott are you going to move or stay there
for your turn
 Yes
 Beau while this is happening what are you
doing
 The one right in front of you
 All righty go ahead and roll an attack with
that
 It should be with your dexterity
 Youre not proficient with it but its
still your dex to hit with it
 A  Okay that pulling out a book here
thank you for your patience  holy water
 Thats a ranged attack against the target
creature Yeah no You try to smash it but it
ducks out of the way Because youre smashing it
it doesnt hit the ground and shatter so you
still have it your hand But you swing with it to
try to break it over this entity and it dodges
out of the way They are very quick
 Because it was a ranged attack sure Its
stretching it a little bit but I will let it happen
  does hit Go ahead and roll damage
 Eight points of damage for that one Nice
 You do hit it but it doesnt take as much
damage as you would expect As you swing toward
it it gives resistance to your fist and numbs it
as you punch through it It does react to the
impact but its not quite as impactful as you
hoped a swing that strong should have been
 You did kind of stinging cotton candy
 Does that finish your turn
 All righty Finishing Beau and Notts go
Fjord youre up
 Id say with searching around everything
its been closer to  minutes
 Your armor is still up
 Sure There we go
 Youve hexed it
  to hit You Hex it and as you swing your
blade  it shimmies out of the
way Its light moves with sudden rapid haste as
soon as you try to strike towards it and dodges
the blow entirely
 All right Ten     The one that
was near you is going to go ahead and make an
opportunity strike against you
 It made an attack that doesnt include you
so yeah technically
 All right so that is an  to hit you
 All right
 And you take ten points of lightning
damage
 Cold damage all right So it takes the
cold does not seem to impact it as heavily as you
would assume It does hurt it but it seems to be
resistant from a lot of the forms of attacks that
you are throwing in its direction
 That hits Roll damage
 Another fist punch towards the willowisp
impacts but doesnt seem to strike as strong as
you hoped but its still taking damage as it runs
past It shocks out at Fjord as Fjord runs by
Using your Sentinel feat to get your reaction hit
off
 That ends Fjords turn Jester youre up
 Thats concentration or not
 Okay Ill pull it up
 Sanctuary is not concentration
 Against which one
 Next to Molly Thats a wisdom save
 That is a 
 It ducks out of the way before the Sacred
Flame bursts into the air hitting nothing You
get the sense through all these attacks that these
things are very quick That end your turn Jester
That brings us to Yasha
 With your greatsword
 Reckless attacks Yeah
 Divine Fury Yeah thats part of your
thing so all that happens at the same time Your
first attack every round
 You roll twice take the higher of the two
  definitely hits You do the damage from
your sword
 The greatsword is d plus your strength
modifier which is three Plus your rage modifier
which is two Thats plus five to whatever you
roll plus your Divine Fury damage
 Whatever you roll plus five Ten plus your
Divine Fury
 Well how much radiant damage is that
 You rush forward rage giant swing down
with your blade You watch this burst of dark
necrotic energy come crackling out of the blow It
hits and you watch as it flickers for a second
and pulls itself back together Its wounded but
it seems to be shrugging off some of the impact
barely You want to stay where you are
 You bonus raged unfortunately
 Thats your turn Yasha
 Yes
 Youre not entirely certain but you do
notice glancing about that they seem to be
emerging from them
 Right
 It is
 Okay
 All righty You swing wide with your first
  does not hit
 You swing your blade and it ducks out of the
way These are quick little fuckers
 Okay Swing
  is enough Its a stationary object So
roll damage on it
 Eight points of damage You bring the blade
in and strike into the alcove and as you yank it
out with the blade you cut it halfway through the
air The actual urn bisects sending ash clouding
into the air around you and you watch as the
willowisp 
 The urn clatters to the ground The top of
it breaks the second half hits with a heavy thud
sound thats different from the sound of the clay
that shatters on the ground That finishes your turn
 Ill say you have to wait until next round You
reach around and finish that whirling dervish action
 Caleb youre up
 All righty
 The one in this alcove there thats right
across the way
  hits yeah Roll damage on that one
 Seven That urn explodes on the inside of
the alcove as the streaking hot Scorching Ray
slams into the clay causing the top half of it to
detonate The bottom half of the clay cracks and
the bottom still remains in place the ash
clouding out of it The one
 This willowisp flickers out It had been
heavily damaged already and that amount of
scattering of the ash caused it to flicker and
disintegrate The bottom of the urn is still
holding itself in place the top half scattered
and broken
 That hits Roll damage on that one
 Eight It shatters and breaks The ash comes
clouding down like the slight drizzle of soft dust
and ash This willowisp vanishes into the
space
 As youre threepoint landing there
Caleb
 Standing but hurling a  As you
stand there the explosion behind from the
Scorching Ray as the bottom half of the urn from
the ceiling 
 All right And well come back to that after

The brief burst of adrenaline has begun to fade from
your bodies your muscles tense slowly beginning
to relax The urn shattered the chamber now still
and quiet No seeming flickering flame of undead
energy or source in the vicinity What do you want
to do
 Is that a one
 You and Molly are doing this if I recall
before we entered the break The base of each urn
the lower half of it is actually a metallined
bottom Looking on the inside as you scoop out
the ash  get it to empty the space you
can see very faintly on the inside of the metal
very faint carvings matching the symbols you have
seen in the previous room
 Each of the urns has all eight symbols in
it
 Yes
 Roughly
 On the faces Okay You take two gold coins
out and you place them roughly and they both fit
into the eyes of one face
 Okay As you place them as soon as they
occur in there the relief opens in half and you
fall Make a dexterity saving throw
 Thats an eight
 Thats a reaction Whats the range on
that
 Yeah youre fine Fjord suddenly begins to
disappear the floor going out underneath This
looks of fear comes over his eyes as Nott barely
releases the spell in time and Fjord goes from
plummeting to gently falling You glide down and
you look down below you into the darkness You
descend ten  
 About  feet down you see something
rapidly coming up below you Looks like a floor or
a surface though it is somewhat amorphous and
jumbled that it looks hard to see any sort of
shape to it
 Okay With your low light vision looking
down below eventually your feet land Its soft
and crunchy as your feet land You glance down and
the smell gets you immediately Its a heavy smell
of decay of dust and ash You look down below
and your are sunken into a pile of longrotting
clothing Occasionally your foot hits something
that cracks and you can see some charred bones
that remain within
 Yes
 Its about  feet down
 Okay You take it and tie it off to the
side
 Yeah As you
 You hear your name and you look up just as
the torch
 You reach up and try and grab it Catch it

 Make an investigation check
  You guys hear the sound of shifting and
clattering of material and bonelike objects
against each other and the stone side of the
chamber You Fjord begin to pour through Youre
tugging through the clothing thats here has been
slowly rotting over time the material coming
apart As you pull it apart you see the tunics
and the pantaloons and all the different pieces
of clothing that are in here pull apart almost as
your fingers go into it Theres no remaining
flesh The decay smell is not fresh decay Its
old stagnant long past sealed decay As you pull
through you do find some pieces of silver and
gold jewelry Theyre tucked in pockets of some of
this clothing You can see one skeletal wrist that
has this really nicelooking bracelet with a chain
that goes around the center finger but the bone is
snapped off and the bone itself is still charred
black around most sides Only a little bit of
grayish white peeks through in places as you rub
your finger over it There are some pieces of
jewelry here thats probably worth a little bit of
money Because you rolled that high you also pull
through in one of the pockets you can see a
small leather case about that wide with the lid
thats burnt As you pull it it tears off
entirely Looking inside theres a very thin
diamond shaped vial You pull it out and shake it
It has a stopper on it that looks either a rubber
or a coated cork that is buttoned on one side that
is built into the actual crystal containers cap
You watch it swish around holding the torch up
to it it has a brackish dark brownblack tint to
it like thick sludge pond water
 Okay It is definitely magical
 I would say abjuration
 You have to identify it to find out
 No It ends here There is a pit and you
finally reached the bottom after pulling through
Youve probably gone through about  or so
equivalent outfits
 No Just the vial that he discovered
 If you guys want to take a short rest about
an hour or so to take a moment and take a
breather Use your hit dice
 Well you guys havent taken a short rest
yet Theyre taking a short rest You can go
upstairs if you want to
 All right that is a potion of necrotic
resistance
 Okay Make an athletics check
 Okay Ten minutes pass You guys climb back
up out of the pit
 Okay You guys head up and join The rest of
them are going to be resting for the next  or so
minutes You can join them if you want them to
wait for you as well
 Okay You guys complete a short rest as
well Go for it
 While you guys are finishing that up Beau
is rummaging through the rubble
 You spend about  minutes or so and you
maybe get about two feet into the rubble and
youre not sure how far back it goes A lot of the
stones now youre getting to are now too big for
you to move
 No The ceiling caved in on that side
 All right You guys have all taken your time
to short rest
 Exactly
 Theyre about that big in the bottom
and about a heavy bowl size
 So what are you guys doing
 So youre taking the rod and you guys are
heading downstairs
 Using the bowls as well Okay You have the
three urn vases
 You guys descend the staircase find your
way to the base floor You head to the hallway
where you had previously disabled the traps and
carefully step across each threshold without
issue they still remain disabled
 You make your way into the central octagonal
chamber What would you like to do
 Schmidt appears unseen
 You watch as the rod gingerly drifts over to
the center place slips in locks into place
 Nothing moves
 Nothing moves
 Molly you have the bowls right
 Beau and Molly head back up the stairs
 As you look going through you see there are
a few other stone cages that have been opened and
left empty That is one that has not been
removed
 Okay make an investigation check
 Does not appear to be trapped
 Make a strength check to try and wedge it
from the stone its attached to
  Its not budging Your lithe
tiefling form is not quite sturdy enough to pull
it from the stone
 Okay Yeah Ill give you that Make a
dexterity check Finding the proper point of
leverage to push on
 The metal actually unhinges and the stone
plummets out you catch it
 No reaction
 Okay which symbol
 Okay Place it in the middle of the star
The metal bowl sits there the fine engravings of
all the symbols on the inside of each bowl dont
seem to react
 Okay you have three bowls and each bowl
contains all eight symbols in the inside so its
hard to match them per se
 The rod doesnt shift
 You move it the other way and it comes out
you have to put it back in and lock it into place
but it doesnt seem to shift or move
 Its a small little metallic knob at the
end
 Best you can look at it it doesnt have any
markings on it or anything unique its just a
solid round knob end
 Something like that
 You spend a good two minutes shifting on the
rod the opposite direction where it locks No movement
 You cast Toll the Dead The dark arcane
energy from Toll the Dead begins to gather around
the hand of Jester and as you release the spell
you watch this burst of necrotic energy siphon
back and immediately attach itself to the very top
of this metallic rod

 Its absorbed and theres a moment of pause
before you feel 
 You hear a shifting of stone this faint
slithering sound begins to fill the chamber
 The slithering stops  You watch as
your eyes catch something shift above you That
large square pillar that was locked in the
ceiling that dome underneath it opened up and a
strange translucent cubelike creature comes
descending from the center I need you guys all to
roll initiative

 

 All right guys So let me pull out the
gelatinous cube stat block here
 That is a super low initiative That is a
zero initiative for the gelatinous cube Four
minus four Initiative  to 
 Nice Caleb coming around finally Then
Jester  to 
 Yes
  to ten
 Beau and Yasha Ten to five
 As it slid into the ground it completely
consumed the rod and immediately begins to move
its way forward ever so slowly in your direction
of the cluster group That being the case top of
the round we have Caleb youre first By the way
where do you want your kitty
 Frumpkin
 There you go What are you doing
 Over here
 All right so it makes a strength saving
throw
 Natural one

 Yep
 Yeah magic holds it in place
 Correct yep for the spells duration
 One minute

 This giant cat paw has grasped around and is
holding the cube in place its claws dug into it
made of earth and dirt and stone
 Aside from the torch that Yasha has no
 There is yeah
 Yes they are very gone Well the torch has
been your main light source since you
 You want Frumpkin to move anywhere
 Frumpkins still back here
 Nott is over there
 All righty that ends Calebs turn Jester
youre up
 No it is not It is considered an ooze
 That is going to be a three Whats the
damage on that
 Go for it
 Six points of radiant damage As this flame
bursts at the side of it part of it jellowiggles
for a second
 It looked like it hurt it maybe but it just
looks like its a big gelatinous cube
 No it did not
 Does that finish your turn
 All right end of Jesters turn Beau and
Yasha you guys are up
 Moving into it to assault it Go for it
 That definitely hits
  points of damage
 So  points of damage with your hit as you
slam it with the side of your staff It shivers
and shakes at the impact and your staff slides
through and barely emerges through the opposite
side of it seemingly closing around and reforming
where the gap was carved through
 Maybe
 All right so youre going to punch it
 Six damage all right As you sock it with
your fist it quakes As you pull your hand back
your whole hand goes numb
 All feeling is lost from almost partway down
your arm and youre like oh thats
 You can move around
 All righty Yasha youre up
 Are you moving in to assault it
 Oh right Because the
 Still hits
 Its not hard to hit Its a giant
quivering cube Roll damage d plus five plus
your d plus two I think
 d plus seven
  plus two for rage three for strength
and plus two for your
  points of damage As you carve through
you actually watch a corner of it slide off and
turn to sludge and water on the ground Your blade
cuts through a section of it and 
 No it hurt it
 No its still cubic You carved through a
portion of it All right does that finish your turn
 All right so you want to back up a little
bit As you pull back a little bit it gets one
swing at you with a pseudopod Part of it
  swings out at you yes it
does
 You do
 It rolled pretty well for having
disadvantage That would be a total of  to hit
 Okay
 You take  points of acid damage as it
slams into you and begins to burn the skin
 Acid damage is not halved unfortunately
And you strike it
 That hits Roll damage
 Six damage All righty
 Yes You punch with your other hand and now
both of your hands are numb and youre like Ugh
 Your whole torso Yasha is burning and
underneath the burning pain you feel numbness
under your chin and your tongues going a little

 Molly youre up
 Okay you dash up to its side there
  hits
 Seven damage nice You strike through and
the ice crystallizes inside As you cut through
the liquid and the moisture  leaves
this
 Yeah Stuck in the inside So thats one
carved through
 Right so its your one strike
 It already used its reaction
 You strike and then dart back jump to the
back of the room getting ready for you next round
That finishes Mollys round Nott and Fjord
youre up
 Roll damage on that
 Technically yes you have Beau
 Double dice and then add your dexterity
modifier
 Shit
 Is it half your level or is it your level
 Its damage equal to your level right
 Thats an additional four so thats 
damage
 Im pretty sure its equal to your level
  Remember thats actually your
archetype
 Regardless you did a lot of damage to it
so  with your level added to it as you strike
it with your crossbow
 
 That hits Roll damage
  points of damage in one round of combat
Not too bad
 That ends Notts turn Fjord what are you
doing
  Right there  will be all the way
back
 Go for it
 Thatll hit Roll damage
  points of damage This thing is just
getting hit with crossbow bolts and the blasts on
the sides of it Its taking damage but its a
hardy mass of slime and gelatin
 Indeed That finish your turn
 All righty its now the gelatinous cubes
turn Its going to attempt to break free of the
large Earthen Paw
 Well its not disadvantage
 That is going to be what save
 Its a strength check So that would be plus
two thats a 
 No it can still move as part of its
action
 Its going to 
 Your cat moved aside I did that to fuck
with you Its engulf is an action and it already
used an action to break free But it did move over
and you guys basically moved out of the way Its
now right next to both Beau and Jester
 It did not Youve already used your
reaction anyway
 Thats going to end its turn That brings us
to the top of the round That is Caleb
 Okay
 You can move it
 Reaches for one creature it can see within
five feet of it
 Sure well go for it
 DC  on what Whats the save on it
 Right strength again Thats a  plus two

 Okay Slowly backing away As you step on
that platform back there you feel it buzz for a
second and nearby you hear this whining of metal
against metal as the trap is still broken but
waiting That ends Calebs go Jester youre up
 All right Save on that is constitution
 Wisdom save That is strangely a 
 Oh shit yeah  minus  So no effect
 Which way
 Towards Fjord So youre going to back away
here
 You can
 Its going to swing at you with its
pseudopod as you move out of its range Thats a
natural 
 Thats some good rolls in the past couple of
rounds Thats going to be ooh  points of
acid damage
 I rolled its d Six four six
doubled
 Not at the moment So you are unconscious
right next to
 She tried to move away
 So it hits you from behind and the last
thing you feel is numbness overtake your body as
darkness clouds around your eyes and you are out
 Im sorry That ends Jesters turn That
brings us to Beau and Yasha
 Well its your turn
 No because that was happening during
Thats since your last turn So your reaction has
come back now You dont get an attack but now
you do after this Its your turn
 It did but you guys have the same
initiative round So you used your reaction on
your turn last round to hit it as she was running
away and now its reset to this round
 Yasha hasnt no Yasha ran out of range and
hasnt been able to use her reaction to hit since then
 Thats how you got the attack on it She ran
away and it hit her and then you got a shot
 All right So youre staying where you are
and start
 All right go for it
  hits
 Nine points of damage nice As you slap it
with the side of the bo again you watch and it
buckles in places
 That hits definitely
 Still hits
 Youre punching this thing and youre
watching it quiver and part of it is shifting and
its looking pretty damaged in spite of its size
at this point in time so well done Yasha what
are you doing
 Yes every turn you can do it
 With advantage because you went reckless
 Roll again just in case Reckless is good
because you have a double chance to critical
 Yeah thats it  damage How do you want
to do this

 You see it being hit by Beau and its slowly
shifting its weight towards the unconscious body
of Jester on the ground You watch it expanding to
start pulling her leg inward
 As you push it all the way into the center
of it it begins to shake and quiver and begins to
slowly encapsulate your arm and forearm as it
rises up and your arm is numb You shake your
head and cut out to the side and as you do you
watch the side of it splash out almost like
popping a water balloon The interior of it turns
to liquid water and begin to spill out as it
slowly deflates and liquefies across the ground
like a jellyfish beached
 Ill tell you one thing that restraint
saved your fucking ass at the start It never got
to engulf Never got a chance to engulf
 From the middle of it No it turns to
liquid gel
 One of these days Ill get to put one of you
guys in
 Actually I guess Ill leave this here
 Ill set it aside
 What you didnt notice during this process
was the pillar above the base reclosed
 Where are the bowls placed right now On the
symbols in the center
 What are you doing
 Was it a regular healing potion
 d plus two
 You guys head out past the traps carefully
stepping across the currentlyheld traps and you
have the bowls in the far hallway
 Which is
 Necromancy Youre casting
 Okay Which is evocation
 You guys all cast your spells No effect on
the bowls
 Its hard to see because theres still the
ash caked on the inside of it
 Its very hard to see with very little light
in here
 Make an intelligence check
  Very good There is something bugging
you in the back of your head Something that says
the fact that these were urns that carried ash
speaks to the purpose of these You cant make the
connection here but the fact that each of these
were filled with ash is bugging you Theres
something there
 Theyre totally empty yes
 The ash has been mostly cleaned out
 Yeah you have your torch and you have your
spells
 You cast Firebolt into one of them The
flame bursts in there as you guys take the torch
over to the side As the fire subsides you see
each of the symbols portions of them are left
glowing and slowly fade
 All of them All the symbols have certain
parts of them that just glow for a second in the
presence of fire and then fade
 Whos going to hold the bowl
 You take the bowl and you hold it out
there It hurts a little but as you hold the torch
underneath it begins to light up You watch as
the symbols begin to glow on the inside of these
metal inscribed bits
  Mark your damage on that
 As you guys are triangulated around those
specific coordinates youve set yourselves what
do you do
 All right Youre casting
 As the three of you complete your
incantations the energy unleashed from the arcane
and divine schools of magic you watch as the
energy disperses from the spell and all three go
 right into the center rod It sits
there shimmering from the impact You guys back
away and it slowly goes cold again On the
opposite side of the chamber you hear 
and you watch as a false wall on the opposite end
rotates open leading you to a hallway on the
opposite side that was previously closed

 Well done guys
 You still got it for an hour
 While hes doing that anybody else doing
anything
 Looking inside with what low light is
coming through from the edges of Yashas
torchlight the first thing that hits you is the
smell Its a strange combination of old decay
strong rust and burnt hair Its hard to
describe but its a very unpleasant mingling of
smells as it hits you Looking inside you see a
chamber ahead divided into three smaller sections
and a center main chamber area The center main
chamber area is what you can most make out the
details of It looks like some sort of inert
arcane circle in the center Theres a symbol
drawn there with runes around but its currently
cold and dark You cant see much further beyond
that because youre staying at the doorway and to
the right and left it looks theres two smaller
chambers immediately and then it goes further
in
 The torchlight extends into the chamber and
you can see a little more now The two side
chambers are almost pillshaped Theyre rounded
at each side and theyre enclosed but open into
the center chamber At each of these rounded
edges as you step inside and glance to the right
domes that are very tightknit dark iron rusted
metal Theyre on the edges of each side You see
loadbearing pillars in the center of the chamber
to the right and left and cold braziers behind
stone that once contained flame for light Across
the way you can see two tables with chairs a
bookcase Thats all you can see at this
distance
 Theyre bars but the bars are an inch inch
and a half between each Its very little space in between
 Are you entering the chamber to look
 Go ahead and make an investigation check
 Best you can tell theres no traps in this
first portion of the chamber
 Okay How drunk are you right now
 Well put you in the drunk status then
 Yasha you enter with the torch as well All
right the three of them enter You guys following
behind or are you staying back with Caleb
 Regular healing potion d plus two
 Its better than half As you guys begin to
enter the chamber you are now stepping into the
center of this inert magical circle with the two
cold braziers and the pillars You see the four
cages on the two opposite ends of the rounded
pillshaped side rooms and across the way there
is the bookcase and the two tables As you get
closer and see theres two nonlit candelabra
What faint bits of candle remnants are there are
mostly melted and the wax dripping off and
causing small pools in the ground but theyve
been cold for some time
 Perception check
 You glance through with the light thats
flickering through the various gaps in this iron
cage and inside you can see a similar clay urn
deep red sitting in the center You see burnt and
tattered clothing at the sides of it
 You glance make a perception check
 You finish your ability Your Detect Magic
is now in effect
 Glancing into one of the far end cages
What did you get Yasha
 You guys hit two other cages on the right
side both the far end close edge of that
platform Youre looking in the small cages You
see another urn and you glance up and see at the
very top theres a chain of some kind that was
wrapped in a noose You see the urn that contains
the ash down within there are remnants of ash
around the outside in a circle and bits of cloth
and material and this chain noose hanging above
where this urn was
 Make an arcana check
 You guys can move to the opposite end if you
want to get closer to the table Looking at the
inert circle it looks like You have an
instinctual arcane knowledge thats been imparted
upon you by whatever this gift has been given to
you so the knowledge comes to you Its alien but
familiar at the same time and your brains trying
to work through this disconnect This circle looks
like it was once developed to be a teleportation
circle but has since it seems been scarred and closed
 Caleb has now finished and you guys can
enter the chamber
 How close do you want to get Theres two
tables both kittycorner into the further chamber
 Yeah I told you a couple times You
finished your spell
 Yes currently it looks like Jester and
Yasha are in between that space
 Theyre both equidistant
 Theres a very faint magical aura from the
symbol in the center but it seems largely clouded
and marked off Its like somebody had taped over
a blacklit drawing Its been marred and prevented
from use from what it seems at the moment
 Yes there is And just to be consistent
here
 It is conjuration There is a very faint
magical essence straight ahead As you focus and
lean forward it becomes a little stronger Above
the bookshelf there is a shape embedded in the
wall that is emitting a slight magical aura
 Above the bookshelf you dont have quite
enough light and Yashas holding the torch thats
being cut off from the roof
 As you approach the bookshelf is mostly
empty Similar to the first chamber you went to
it looks like either everything in here was taken
or destroyed Most of the bookshelf is plain empty
with broken pieces and tattered bits of paper
and no books present on the shelf at the moment
 That you see on the shelf as you close in to
look at it As you climb the shelf and look up
above the bookshelf there is placed ornamentally
on the wall a very wide blade longsword of some
kind is bolted onto the wall as an ornamental
display
  Best you can tell theres no trap
 Okay It takes you a moment because its
bolted in The blade comes free and you pull back
on it you begin to Whoa off the side You guys
catch Jester She plummets off of the bookshelf
You manage to trust fall her if you will as she
falls from the top
 It is a heavylooking blade The hilt of it
is gold and curls up to the side It is all these
tiny runes inscribed along the edge The central
blade is thick Its about that wide at the side
and slowly tapers to the edge None of you come
from a specific blacksmith background so you
wouldnt know the purpose of the blade but it
looks dangerous
 Yeah its about six feet long
 The tables by the way that are right next
to the bookshelf have writing utensils quills on
the side one has an inkwell that has been long
dried over that has a spider web attached to it
 Make an investigation check
 You dont notice any paper but as you
glance underneath one of the tables on the bottom
it looks like one book has been not taken or at
least had fallen beneath and was left behind
 I heard it It was like  on the
table
 The book as you pull it out a corner of it
is burned pretty heavily
 Correct Theres no magical source from it
Where you found it theres a bit of an ash trail
that leads back towards the far wall towards
where one of the braziers is You get the sense
that maybe whatever was in here may have been
thrown in the braziers to burn and this book got
discarded or thrown You open and start looking
through the pages What languages do you know
 It would be under proficiencies probably
 Oh its not Okay
 You do not recognize this script
 As you finish casting the spell Calebs
hand incantation completes the eyes light up with
a strange yellowish energy All the words on the
page that previously made no sense suddenly shift
go out of focus and come back into focus in a
language that you can understand It is Draconic
Reading through briefly and it is scribblings
disjointed and broken in place Taking a moment to
look through you get the sense this is the
journal of somebody named Siff Duthar
 Siff SIFF Duthar
 The pages the ramblings speak of a coming
war They talk about foolish pawns who follow
their gods to annihilation They speak of the
armies of Ghor Dranas washing over the land and
pauper and kings alike being saved not at all and
being placed on a pike and held like a banner into
battle regardless of who they are They speak of
the weakness of flesh and the need to endure
beyond the paltry life shell that were given It
talks about experiments with refugees finding if
the soul is bound to the flesh in any form be it
ice or ash It speaks of an obsession with
avoiding the eternal hunger of The Crawling King
he who tunnels beneath the world and will find him
 It speaks of a bounty hunter who had
infiltrated this sanctum after Siff And while it
cost Siff his legs the hunter was burned into the
brazier flames of erasure A trophy shall be
taken and displayed as a warning
 From there it grows more and more manic
The scrawlings taking you a moment even with the
spell to focus and make it out Speaking on
quaking within the earth around that shakes the
surrounding hills and darken the sky The betrayer
gods come The power of man must remain The
arcane gifts must bypass their punishment show
them that they are not above their creations The
final notes grow even more paranoid worried that
the secrets that Siff seeks will fall into the
hands of Ghor Dranas and that all must be
destroyed All must come to ash and from the
ashes shall rise again Thats the final page
before the rest of the book is charred beyond recognition
 I can
 As you guys are having this conversation
you begin to notice as youre yelling and
talking your breath is now visible in the air
the temperature growing colder and colder still
You looking past the chamber towards one of these
urns you see a very faint light a flicker within
where the ashes are As this happens the center
circle of the chamber begins to glow darker and
darker as a shadow begins to emerge from the
center of the chamber Shifting out of the ground
some sort of whipping cloak around a humanoid
figure rises out made of pure shadow and darkness
The cloth is tattered and shifting around causing
this horrible whipping sound like a wind is
blowing extremely intensely but only localized
around this figure As the face is visible you
see this ghastly fleshstretched against the skull
thats still made of dark gray matter that begins
to shift and move with the shadows around it The
voice  Now secrets are yours Well pick up
there next week

 We have a week to think about it
 You guys were all towards the bookshelf and
the tables It emerges from the center area near
the circle not from the center of the circle but
in that vicinity He wasnt emerging he wasnt
teleporting in He was rising out the ground while
Mollys off by one of the cages on the side
 You did
 Yeah You and Molly are both at the other
corners
 You guys were sent here to
 This is a game of choices guys Figure out
what your choices are for next week On that note
well done guys
 If it wasnt already

 Thank you so much for watching Have a
wonderful night and a wonderful week and is it
Thursday yet Good night
 Welcome back everyone Last we left off

The Mighty Nein after being in proximity to some
sort of an assault from Xhorhasian operatives in
the city of Zadash here in the center of the
Empire they found themselves also caught up in a
murder of the HighRichter in the city They
pulled away and realized there was a manhunt for
individuals that were seemingly seen in connection
to this murder As this was transpiring they had
to smuggle out some allies they had found and had
been working with Dolan and Horris Dolan part
of this whole deal was to get him involved in the
local politics Horris needed to be smuggled out
for safety in case they got caught You made your
way to the Evening Nip met up with Yasha Down
there you had a conversation with this individual
called The Gentleman You made a deal Youve
decided to trust each other on this endeavor and
basically do a quid pro quo A little favor to
one favor for the other and see if this is a
business relationship you would want to develop
In doing so Horris was smuggled out of the city
Safely seemingly
 I keep saying that because you werent there
to confirm I dont want to say that it happened
because the mysterys fun You were brought down
through the tunnels to the Underworks towards an
underground dock where the river that exited to
the northeast towards Berleben was You loaded up
on boats to make your way towards a recently
uncovered but barely explored underground research
facility long buried The Gentleman asked you to
enter it see what you found clear it out if
possible and return As you made your way down
there assailed by a few of the creatures that
existed in that tunnel you found the exterior of
this research facility broke your way in began
to meander around and discover strange mysteries
afoot in its construction The urns throughout the
vicinity the strange wisps of spiritual energy
came to assault you in the process Bypassing
traps mostly kind of
 Completing the mystery of the strange arcane
runes in the ceiling and the schools of magic that
they seemed connected to found your way into some
sort of a secret study or den where there were
research tables set up and a mostly empty
bookshelf braziers filled with ash to the side
between pillars two small chambers where these
cages with tight knit bars remained containing
urns and empty nooses hanging above These urns
filled with ash
You began to look throughout the room You found a
sword across the upper ceiling an ornamental
blade of some kind You recovered a book of notes
and began to read through to get a feel for the
person the entity that seemed to have written
what remained of these pages Around this time
the wind began to pick up in the center of the
chamber as this darkened figure began to rise out
of the stonework This large tattered cloak of a
figure spreading whipping around like this
sudden wind is tossing aside sails of a dark ship
This semiskeletal ghostly face of material began
to emerge from it Its voice slowly hissing out
My secrets are yours You saw small glows begin
to emerge from the ash and to the urns nearest the
two of you That my friends is where we last
left off
 As this thing emerges here it doesnt seem
to at the moment make any sort of aggressive
maneuver What do you do
 Imagine a figure that is wrapped in four or
five layers of robes and the robes have been
shredded out all these moving tendrils of cloth
and black shadow energy that are spinning around
in places Its center chin and body are
stationary The bottom half of its body seems to
taper into nothingness disappearing into cloth
and evershifting and whipping material at the base
 The head turns over and locks onto Jester
Doesnt answer
  Glides slowly in your direction
 Theres a brief moment where the entitys
head much like a young puppy confused by a
rattling sound in the distance  in
Jesters direction A secret for trade
 You know what Im going to pull the battle
map
 Hes drifted up to that point there
 As you guys are preparing here the whispers
begin to slowly spill out of its face voices
spreading out I need Jester Yasha and Beau to
all make a wisdom saving throw please
 Yes
 Both of you succeed actually
 The secrets begin to penetrate your ears
You close off your consciousness and put your
hands up to close the space They dont seem to
penetrate your mind Beau however these words
start shooting into your brain You feel for a
moment your grasp on reality begin to slip
Suddenly the world begins to spin You feel
yourself assaulted from all angles You see
flashes of ancient warfare of giant columns of
fire crashing from the cosmos You spin your staff
around retroactively I need you to make an attack
against Yasha please
 Whats your armor class
 Im pretty sure that doesnt hit you
 You see Beau suddenly her eyes go wide
swing the staff wide in your direction You
deflect it with your blade
 Now I need you all to roll initiative
 The first conversation wasnt quite what he
was looking for
 Conflicted feelings
  to 
 Nott at the top  to 
 Ooh Yasha
  to ten Oh boy
 Ten to five
 Eight for Beau Six for Caleb Five both of
you Jester and Molly
 At this moment Nott you see this entity as
it suddenly begins to emanate these whispers into
the air Your friends start all of a sudden
grasping their faces You see Beau try and swing
at Yasha Chaos is breaking loose What are you
doing
 Where are you going
 Over here
 Good to know Yasha your turn
 What does Yasha want to do What is Yashas
instinct
 You do not see a foot on his body no
 Ive already given you a piece More
 What are you doing
 Thats a dormant runic circle that has been
lying there Doesnt seem to be reacting to his
presence at all
 Okay Youre holding off on rage
 Youre raging
 You bonus action rage You angrily grit your
teeth and rush up swinging your sword in the air
Make your attack
  hits Roll damage
 Plus rage damage ten right Ten total You
rolled five plus three for your strength plus
two for your rage That would be a total of ten
 With which weapon is this
 Which is technically baseline magical so
okay
 Meaning its a very minor magical effect As
you strike your blade carves through part of its
body Some of the cloth tears apart and he tries
to grasp around the blade as you pull it free from
nearby Its face its eyes click back towards you
When I say eyes you now get a look and its
these vacant holes and this tightly pulled skin
against this skeletal face Black energy is
billowing out of it like smoke is slowly pouring
out of the sockets Thats your turn
 Now out of the side cages these glows all
begin to emerge as four more of these wisp
entities you had previously encountered in the
chamber begin to shift through the cages towards
the nearest source of life This ones going to go
towards Nott This ones going to stay right there
with Molly This ones going to go after Fjord as
well as this one there On that note against Nott
the attack is a seven That is a low roll I do
not think that hits you As you see it emerge you
freak out as it swings by and ducks into the wall
briefly before reemerging shifting through the
actual stone Against Molly another seven
 Two threes in a row Two against you Fjord
Thats better Thats a 
 The two of them begin to hit you from both
sides Youre not quite sure how to defend One of
them seems like its about to sweep at you You go
to deflect it as the other one slaps into the back
of your head as you feel this shock energy hit you
in the base of the skull Your eyes go white for a
second You take  oh no sorry I rolled the
wrong dice for that one You take five points of
lightning damage
 You see the ice crystals coalesce around the
outside not doing quite as much damage as you
would have expected
 The other ones going to try and use that
moment to swing at you and rob you of a little
more life force That is going to be a  What is
your armor class
 Miss then Just swings past you The orbs
now are glowing and sparking preparing for the
next round of assault
 The next is going to be the entity in the
center
 The entity is going to use its Howling
Babble ability Every creature within  feet of
it that can hear it has to make a wisdom saving
throw so thats all of you guys
  Youre just  feet outside of
it
 You would yes
  hits Roll damage
 It is not so it is less affected by the
wound as it strikes through its body You see it
tear through some of the material and part of the
matter The energy disperses the moment of impact
It damaged it but something about it being
between the planes and its essence is making it
not as effectively damageable with regular
weaponry
 That would be the wisdom save
 Beau Jester Yasha and Nott As this faint
energy begins to disperse throughout the chamber
you hear thousands of voices trying to whisper
into your ears simultaneously Theyre not making
sense and as they weave your whole body begins
to go catatonic Your muscles tense and you fall
to your knees Youre all paralyzed until the end
of your next turn
 Its going to fly up and back
 Every melee is if it hits That ends its
turn That brings us to Beau Youre paralyzed so
at the end of your turn it fades Sorry not
paralyzed stunned Its not paralyzed Its stunned
 Correct It is not I had to read
 Stunned means you cant really do anything
this turn but half make a sentence Youre aware
of your surroundings but you cant take actions or
move At the end of your turn it wears off
 That ends Beaus turn
 Caleb youre up
 You back up against the wall there That
ends your turn Caleb
 Jester and Molly Jester you are no longer
stunned That is your turn
 Molly
 Okay The cage because the slits are very
small you cannot get your full hand in there so
with the blade there you might be able to get it
so make an attack roll with disadvantage
 Just misses You strike the outside of it
but the blow you watch as the urn 
 You pull it out and jab once more towards
it
 Apparently
 As your blades are getting caught in the
cage and try to pull it out the large wisp is
slowly pushing towards your body
 Fjord
 Okay with disadvantage because youre
aiming through the smaller space It actually has
cover Its largely just a small space youre
shooting through
  does hit
 Your spell attack modifier
 Yeah that doesnt hit unfortunately Youre
trying to shoot the remainder and manage to hit
the bar and the bar bends back a little bit from
the impact of the blast However its not
actually hitting the urn on the inside
 Yes they are
 All right Fjord Top of the round again
Nott you manage to  shrug off the stun
but thats the end of your turn
 Yasha you shrug off the stun Thats the
end of your turn All right
 With that all the wisps begin to close in
once more on their targets Molly thats a 
 You take six points of lightning damage as
it shocks you from the side again The other one
striking against you Nott That is going to be a
 to hit
  armor class You manage to duck out of
the way of this one as well This one is beginning
to flicker angrily as it cant seem to grasp and
tear any sort of life force from you with shock
 Two against you Fjord That is a ten six
plus four
 Misses The other one is a 
 Thats five points of lightning damage
 Which it takes a reduced amount That ends
their turn Now well see if the Howling Babble
It does not regenerate that ability It does not
recharge it Now as the spectral entity begins to
fly back towards this side its going to shift
over in this direction Were going to say that
its gliding up near this pillar here Its about
 feet up right by where the ceiling is and
its glaring down at everybody
 Its going to go ahead and use Actually
its not because youre all too far away
Instead its going to coast down towards the one
that struck at it last turn Rush right there
 Between that and a Deathly Hallow look but
even more intense Like an epic Deathly Hallow
Its going to go ahead and attempt a Maddening
Touch against you Yasha
 That is a  to hit
 All right You suffer thats actually a
really shitty roll for him Nine points of psychic damage
 Plus three Sorry  points of psychic
damage
 Then its going to go ahead and attempt to
fly back up into where it was in the ceiling
after it makes its strike
 Oh you would get an attack of opportunity
against it
 Thats right Sentinel feat Oh this might
fuck it up As it comes down and strikes at you
you feel this burst of maddening intent shower
into your head It sparks your brain with this
horrible searing pain You guys watch as Yasha
screams out and begins to withdraw With that she
all of a sudden clicks back into reality and
swings wide with the sword What did you roll
  hits go ahead and roll damage

 Which means he cant move The Sentinel feat
prevents him from moving
 Yes you may Could have done that last
round too but forgot
 Yeah with your rage its whatever you
rolled plus five and then plus half your level
Plus seven technically
  points of oh man thats nasty As it
tries to pull away you click back into reality
and swing wide with your sword As you do you cut
right through the center of its body out the
other end You watch as the robe splinters open
You see this glowing pulse of dark energy in the
center As it  it has to fight to
reform its semicorporeal form It looks like
its hurt pretty bad
 Yasha that ends your turn
 Oh thats right It was an attack of
opportunity Sorry that was the creatures turn
Beau youre up
 All righty go ahead and roll your ranged
attack d plus your proficiency
 That hits Roll d
 It takes eight points of radiant damage as
it splashes on its form The flames suddenly begin
to ignite across the front of its cloaked
exterior Because holy flames are licking up the
side of it and burning and its 
 Its a ranged attack roll Ill say sure
Usually you get the bonus on a punch You have to
move up to do it though
 Sure Good call
 Two more punch attacks or unarmed
 Both of those hit
  damage You rush up off the shoulder
after slamming it against the ground You come up
with a punch and an uppercut from underneath As
your fists impact its like punching through
heavy cold cloth You feel like almost youre
punching nothing as you do While youre
impacting youre not sure how much damage its
doing 
 That ends your turn Beau Caleb youre
up
 You didnt seem to notice anything
 You could get right up to it
 All right You can get right there
 Its a  foot cone correct
 You can from the edge of where youd be
would be there you can technically No it would
not quite hit that but you can hit the creature
 It makes its save That is a seven
 Whats up
 It rolled a seven on its DC so no
  okay Half of that The fire doesnt
seem to have as much impact Largely because of
its ghostly form most things it seems to be
resistant towards but its still taking damage as
youre doing this Now its being flanked from all
of you guys That ends Calebs turn Jester
Molly youre up
  You have to get over here to
 First off the willowisp makes a strike
at you attack of opportunity
 
 As you rush past  points of lightning
damage
 I rolled double eights on ds The
willowisp suddenly as you try to rush it
actually darts in front of you You run towards
it and it actually passes through your entire
torso As it does shocking your lungs and heart
and for a second your heart doesnt beat Then
kicks back in Your whole body feels cold but you
keep running You push past Caleb and get right up
next to the creature
  hits
 Eight does not hit unfortunately
 The pain is too strong on one strike and you
go wide but you turn around and all of a sudden
theres a moment of clarity As the pain clicks
in you clench your jaw and swing back striking true
 You do the extra three anyway because its
undead
 How much is the sword How much is the
radiant
 Five all right cool It takes less damage
from the swords but the radiant does go through
Its looking pretty beat up at this point now
Between the different attacks youve done its
starting to freak out now Its trying to figure
out how best to deal with its situation That ends
your turn Molly Jester what are you doing
 From where youre standing
 You dart over this direction Whats the
radius on that  feet
 Thatll catch all three of those and the
guy Was it wisdom saves against your spell DC
 No youre in a bad place
 Far end willowisp right there that would
be a six No That one nope That one over there
is going to attempt as well Thats a nine No so
that one is also turned The one over there is
fleeing That is going to be a  That does
succeed
 The main guy natural  These two wisps
now are slightly you rush up and you pray for a
second and hope You know this inspiration hits
you As you clasp the symbol suddenly the strange
little archway on the top of the symbol begins to
glow Theres this large burst of deep blue energy
that radiates outward As it strikes it washes
over the main creature with no effect As it hits
the two other side willowisps both of them
shiver and begin to shift away Looking like
theyre actually running in fear as fast as they
can from Jester in the center Thats your action
 Not too bad
 Fair enough You have Sanctuary on you right
now Jester that ends your turn Fjord youre up
  hits go ahead and roll damage
 With that that one pot shatters The ash
explodes in a small cloud pushing on the side of
the wall behind the cage That one wisp next to
you flitters out of existence
 You can
 Oh wisdom ability checks not saving
throws
 Disadvantage on wisdom ability checks That
ends your turn Fjord
 Nott youre up
 You can Inside the cage you can see one
there and you assume theres one in there because
you saw Molly going towards it
 Which you can do without disadvantage
because of your feat
 Well you still have disadvantage to try and
fire at it because its in the cage Sorry I
just realized Its in the cage
 Thats for melee stuff This is it being
covered and youre aiming through these tiny
holes as youre firing at it
 Well essentially Yeah Id say at this
close it has threequarters cover Its a plus
five to its AC What did you roll
 Yeah it hits Well say it hits because
youre right up against it with a crossbow Youre
not having to aim in with it Youre bolt
flying Roll the damage
 Six is enough The pots arent very strong
its just hard to touch  That
willowisp manages to discorporate next to you
 Okay that one you do have disadvantage on
as youre farther away from it
  still hits Go ahead and roll damage
 That pot shatters
 That was left over from your welcome party
 Yasha its your turn
 Go for it
 That hits roll damage
  As you swing past with the sword and arc
upward you cut through and its cloak cannot hold
back together Theres now this giant opening
where this vacuous cold heartbeat glows visible
from the inside and its body is flickering
having a hard time keeping itself together on this
side of reality Does this end your turn Yasha
 You see this dull blue glow thats now
visible from where you struck through it It looks
like its falling apart
 Yasha that ends your turn
 Unfortunately no Youve already used your
action Thats what a monk does Just a little flick
 That ends Yashas turn Now the one wisp
thats by you is going to shift through the wall
onto this side and is going to make a strike at
you Fjord That is a  to hit
 That is  points of lightning damage to
you
 As it shocks through you and you fall to
one knee for a moment Its going to shift into
that pillar and vanish You do get an attack of
opportunity on it as it leaves your range
 Regular
  does not hit You go to strike and
unfortunately it just makes it into the pillar and
you hit stone and sparks off of it It does take
one point of force damage from spending its turn
inside the wall Now it is the entitys turn It
is going to attempt well see if its Howling
Babble returns It gets its Howling Babble back
 Oh man I forgot that I need all of you to
roll a wisdom saving throw please
 Nope
 No theres no check for it Beau Nott
 Let me look at the
 Its not technically targeting the creature
youre just in the radius of whats happening
 Unfortunately Whatd you roll
 Well now you get to roll
 No
 No
 First off all of you guys who failed your
all suffer  points of psychic damage and you are
stunned until the end of your next turn
 Jesters unconscious
 Its going to attempt to slip into the
floor
 You and Caleb both get an attack of
opportunity physically
 Youre stunned
 As it begins to shift into the ground
 How do you want to do this

 As it tries to shift downward Molly
pulling back from the screams and strange howling
babble emanating from its body you swing wide
spinning the blade in the air and jam down on top
of its form As you do it disperses like an
explosion of wind from the center You watch the
cloth of its body suddenly scatter like someone
had blown a heavy wind into a stack of loose cloth
that all eventually turns into ash and vanishes
There you see a dull blue glow where the sword is
grinding against the stone before that eventually
dissipates into nothingness
 Beau your stun wears off
 Caleb
 Make a perception check
  Glancing about in the area with
torchlight from Yasha you can see one visible pot
that has not been shattered in that cage
 A ten just barely misses You attempt to
strike through and it smashes against the wrought
iron gate on the outside and disperses against
it
 You can get right up to it if you want to
 That brings us to Jester and Molly
 You cant say anything Youre unconscious
 Jesters now conscious
 You stopped their effect
 That brings us to Jesters turn as you come
to consciousness since you guys are on the same initiative
 Thats half your movement to get up and
then five ten  thats as far as you get
 What do you have to throw
 You can make an investigation check to try
and find a rock on the ground
 Well you took your action searching the
ground
 You do not find a rock You spend the better
part of six seconds going Wait Ah no its a
piece of black cloth shit No actual stone
unfortunately Sorry Jester
 Fjord youre up
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
  points of damage nice With that that
pot shatters and you see this flicker in the
stone column behind as the energy of the wisp
flares out from the side
 Nott Yasha you guys doing anything
 No actually your stun has worn off Nott
you doing anything Oh Youre stunned as well
Your stun now wears off As you guys finish
shaking off the energy this cold energy begins to
emerge from the far wall through the bookcase
 The same entity comes through the bookcase
like its emerging from something behind
 As you struck it the energy dispersed
 As you guys watch it push out of the wall
 making its way there
 Caleb make an intelligence check You make
a religion check with advantage because you have undead
 Straight intelligence modifier
 After reading through the notes and going
through the book you recall that a lot of the
magic in here entails binding the soul to the
remains of the physical form as youve seen with
all of the wisps It is a similar return of the
entity you just fought
 On its turn its going to attempt first
lets see if it gets its Howling Babble back It
does not its a one So its going to try
Whispers of Madness again I need only Yasha and
Beau actually Everyone else is spread out Yasha
and Beau I need you both to make a wisdom saving
throw as the whispers now begin to emanate from
its mouth
 You watched it emerge through the bookcase
 Okay Yasha
 Seven so Beau
 Beau you resist the whispers and close your
eyes and as you come up to try to make this
point next thing you see is Yasha looking at you
and  down with your sword Make an attack
against Beau
 You do
 Well no you got it
 Your vision as this happens all of a
sudden goes black You watch as this dark blood
pools at the corners of Yashas face as you go
blind from his blood maledict So roll with
disadvantage on the attack
 Lowest one
 You see it just in time and bat it out of
the way It hits the stone next to you You do
suffer  points of psychic damage however
 You watch as she swings at you and the
impact as you parry it Yasha goes down with the
blade swing onto the ground
 Theres an ability you get at later levels
that does something in this scenario
 Dont think you have something for that
right now I could be wrong
 Ill double check just to be safe
 That ends the creatures turn As that
happens its going to lift up and vanish into the
ceiling You watch it disappear out of place It
does take force damage for being in the wall
Thats actually a good roll six force damage to
it You have the divine energy path zealot and
your soul is marked for battle the only ability
you have now is the warrior of the gods You dont
have the other one yet
 That finishes its turn Beau youre up You
watch Yasha slam on the ground unconscious next
to you the blade clattering to the ground and
coming to rest The creature lifts up 
and vanishes into the stone above you
 It was not close enough to you
unfortunately
 You get the staff on the fulcrum Go ahead
and make an athletics check to force it
 You try and  and its starting to
rock but its heavy You start pushing You cant
quite get the bookcase to come over
unfortunately That ends your turn
 That brings us to Caleb
 You can hold it as an action Youre casting
the spell Then whenever something triggers it
you release it
 It seemed to take damage though lesser
when you hit it
 Jester Molly
 You go ahead and expend your bonus action
Roll for that d plus your Wisdom modifier
 You heal ten hit points Yasha you come to
consciousness on the ground Your weapon is about
two feet from your grasp The first thing you do
your eyes shoot open and then shoot to your
weapon Natural instinct to defend yourself Its
easily within your grasp You just have to get up
to grab it
   You get right to the
bookcase
 Make an athletics check
 That would be your action to do so youve
already tried The DC is going down as you both
are working on it
 As you grab and reach around the side with
Beau you pull on the bookcase  You
step back quickly as it slams onto the ground
 Right behind it theres a small pocket where
the stone seems to have crumbled a bit It looks
like a dark space on the inside
 Its about that wide on the wall
 All right does that end your turn Jester
 Thats all youve got Molly
 You have darkvision so as both you and
Jester glance inside you can see there is a small
five foot by five foot chamber inside where there
are a number of pots and small cases It was a
small burial chamber of some kind There in the
center you see this large urn about a foot and a
half wide squat a dull gray color You have no
color depth in this darkness unfortunately with
your darkvision but its this very squat
wellmade vase or urn of some kind
 Youre having to put your arm through and
swing towards it so disadvantage on each strike
  just barely hits but its a hardy urn
Well see how much damage you deal
 Eight points of damage You make impact and
you see a part of it crack from the blow but its
not enough to shatter it
 As you pull it out and jam the other arm in
to go for a straight strike with your scimitar
  hits Roll damage
 As you reach through you feel the urn break
beneath the blow Theres this moment of silence
as you hear this  dully filter out The
entity slowly shifts from the ceiling as you watch
it disintegrate Not vanishing like it did before
but slowly dissipating Its form suddenly goes
from extremely menacing to almost sad as you
watch it turn to nothingness
 It looks like its holed up The small hole
looks like somebody tried to push through or
previously emerged and bricked what they could
You cant fit through the hole unfortunately
 You guys take a short rest of about an hour
or so as you sit down and recover your breath
take a moment to center yourself tend to your
wounds
 Youre pretty tiny Make an acrobatics
check This is one of the benefits of being
something so small
 Ten You just manage to pull through It
wasnt a hard
 Grease the goblin action is what youre
taking
 No not for Tough it gives you additional
hit points Theres another feat that does that
 You got Tough for the additional hit points
 Durable is the one feat that gives you 
Constitution when you roll hit dice
 You take a moment back and run and dive in
The greased goblin squeezes through the small gap
It scrapes your shoulders and hurts a bit You
tumble in which is great because you land in the
remains of the ash You are covered in grease
which all sticks to you

 You got ashed and feathered Tarred and
What do you call it Oiled and ashed
 Its a small chamber Its five foot by five
foot Anyone else is going to be pretty down in
there but you fit in fairly comfortably Theres
the shattered urn and a few small pieces of
pottery with intricate gold scrolling Theyre
probably very nice pieces of art or decor
 Go ahead and make an investigation check
 As best you can tell the room seems safe
 There are two large ones nowhere near as
big as the central urn thats been shattered but
theres two in the corner and a few small boxes
off to the side
 You glance over the inside and they are
empty They look to be pieces of art that may have
meant something to the person who previously
 You may have to dig the hole open a little
bit
 Given a little time Yasha begins to peel
the stones from the wall around it
 Yeah which one Theres one on each side
 Okay so you take the right one You lift
the lid and as you do you pull it open and
powder emerges into your face Make a constitution
saving throw
 Four Okay You take nine points of poison
damage and youre poisoned for the next hour
 This cloud enters your lungs and you begin
coughing It burns the inside of your throat
 There we go 
 Its five by five
 No theres nothing else You look down into
the box There are sets of gold and silver rings
and jewelry It looks like whatever jewelry once
may have been dressed upon the individual who was
interred in that urn that was scattered This is
where their jewelry was placed
 Okay That box opens up and theres another
splash of that same poisonous powder but youre
off to the side It only gets anyone whos
immediately in front of the box
 That box contains a folded raiment of some
kind like a ceremonial mantle made of dark black
and gray cloth with red embroidered designs on it
 Make an arcana check
 You are knocking it out of the park for
charity
 From the giant boxes you mean
 The art are two large wellmade vases that
you eventually pull through the space here
 You dont recognize it These were made a
long time ago
 Okay You have the folded mantle
 The mantle is a dark black a front chest
mantle area with gray stripes coming along the
sides and this red embroidered design that emerges
from around the neck all across the front and
back of the mantle
 No
 I mean you can make an arcana check to see
if you recognize any elements of it
 You get a closer look and you can see parts
of the edges are burned The very bottom parts of
it seem to have been committed to some sort of
flame The edges of it are singed a bit The black
collar causes it to be lost at a distant view but
close up you can see where its been damaged
Theres a fold at the front of it a small pocket
right there
 Kind of its on the side Because a mantle
would go down to about there for someone wearing
it you put your hand in there and its a heavy
material
 The shelf is mostly empty
 You have the urns in the cages You have the
tables over there You have the two braziers
filled with ash on the sides You have the broken
cages back there Everything that you see there is
whats in the chamber
 Make an investigation check
 Okay Totally fine
  okay You go through from cage to cage
The urns are scattered ash Nothing catches your
eye from those two The nooses you pull through
and tug on and the rope rots and breaks in your
grasp You go past the brazier on that side with
the ashes and you poke around with your staff
and something catches your staff underneath the
ash You prod in there and as you push it aside
theres an object in the ash that is partially
burned As you pull it free and dust it off its
another book A large portion of the back of it is
burned off and most of the pages are destroyed on
the back end but a good half of the book is
mostly still intact Like when it got thrown in
there to be destroyed the flame wasnt quite
strong enough to consume the entire book
 Yeah As you go through its filled with
strange script and scrolling Make an arcana check
 You can
  You dont understand the nature of any
of this but it seems magical in nature The
script and elements of design remind you of the
things you saw on the ceiling in the previous
room Though not exact there are similarities to
the way the script is drawn
 It was in the brazier right there in the
center
 You start bashing and shaking it You bend
and eventually tear through some of the cage and
glance through You guys together begin to
inspect the other cages and honestly in there
what you find is ash Most everything in this
chamber has been destroyed Intentionally it
seems Either by the previous denizen who lived
here that you destroyed or somebody else that
had been here in here before The only things that
you find are what was in that burial chamber in
the back and that mostly burned tome in your
hand
 Sure Make a perception check
 Theres like a purple froth at the corner of
her mouth Its spitting out
 Go ahead and make a medicine check
 Okay Ill say yes You reduce the duration
of the poison from an hour to about ten minutes
In the time it takes for guys to finish up most
of the poison eventually begins to wear off You
still look at bit worse for wear
 No coins Its just jewelry
 Yeah Theres probably a good  or so rings
in there
 Detect Magic on the pile
 Correct The only magical essence you get
from that pile is the large sword that was taken
off the wall Its not a magical aura from the
book you just pulled from there but even your
quick glance at the way that its bound and the
construct of it is familiar to you
 The sword is the one thing thats giving off
a magical aura
 It is a partially damaged but in some ways
intact spell book
 Holding your symbol and concentrating on it
and whispering beneath your breath with a big
smile the pages begin to shift out and form into
a full book The half section thats burned is
restored to its previous

 However the script isnt there It doesnt
restore any of the writing on the inside of the
book unfortunately
 Where you get to the pages where it was
burned the ink ends at that edge
 The mantle is not magical It looks like it
was an ornamental
 More like a ceremonial shroud On the inside
of the pocket there is a lot of dried blood on
the inside of it It looks like something was kept
in there that at one point was very viscous and
covered in crimson
 Of the book that you find these are the
remnants of the interior of it and this is the
sword identified for you
 As part of the Identify spell you would know
what its called
 Its not a Counterspell Its a Dispel
Magic You still have to roll to see if it
happens but essentially you
 Anything within the realm of Dispel Magic
The spell itself
 The hilt curves at the tip and comes up at
an angle like this Like a very subtle V shape
With the scrolling and runes on the edge The
blade itself is this wide thick gradually coming
to a point greatsword about five feet long from
hilt to edge of blade Its practically an anime
sword Looking at it and based on what he
discovered of the sword itself it was used in the
Age of Arcanum as an executioners blade to kill
mages that were caught by the law and went against
the law of the land It was used and probably had
been used to execute a number of mages in the past
 Caleb as youre recalling the information
from the Identify sword you recall the notes that
you picked from the book when you entered the
chamber that spoke of a bounty hunter that had
come for Siff The trophy that was taken
 You get the sense the sword that was in the
wall was the trophy taken from that bounty hunter
  rings
 Yeah you are a mess right now
 While shes looking for that what are you
guys doing
 You dont see anything else moving no
 She found it
 He said clear it out
 Pretty much find out the nature of the
place clear it out bring back what you find and
he may let you keep some of the spoils
 Essentially
 There were rings a couple of loose
bracelets It was basically a collection of
ornamental jewelry
 No the only way out that you know of is the
same way you came in
 I will say unfortunately the urn that was
destroyed that contained Siffs remains is a bit
large for the Mend spell You can only mend a
footbyfoot space The urn was a big old thing
 Nope You see its been scarred
intentionally from the inside Possibly whatever
flurry of intent that Siff had to burn the book
destroy everything burn everything from the
inside also was to destroy the circle and allow
nothing else to come through You get the sense
that the final moments in this chamber were
probably very paranoid
 That would be a religion check
 For you No
 Oh You rolled pretty well same difference
Well say it would have lasted a little longer
but you still managed to outlast the poison There
was no threat at that moment Whatd you roll
  religion Anybody else No
 What did you roll
 There you go The Crawling King is known
as What you can recall with a  strangely and
the information comes to you esoterically Youre
not entirely certain where the inspiration for
this knowledge comes from but you have these
images of one of the betrayer gods in history
Youve heard stories or something that inspires
a monstrous terrible worm crawling through the
deepest tunnels of the world Now locked away
PostCalamity with all the rest of the betrayer
gods
 Best you can tell hes telling the truth
 They look like theyre made out of nice
metal Theyre not made out platinum or anything
but theyre fine candle lamps Could be a
silverlike material
 Make an intelligence check
 Another natural one You have a hard time
telling what kind of metal this is
 You have two you never used from the fight
 No it does not It was ornamentally placed
on the wall
 Are you trying to place the blade inside
 You place it into there It gets to the
hilt and it wont go all the way in
 You have too much stuff in it
 The unfortunate thing is its a very long
blade in comparison to other points The space
itself is somewhat amorphous but you consider it
still a central space
 Okay You guys make your way back up through
the chamber where you had the encounter with the
gelatinous cube and solved the riddle of the
hidden interior of this research facility You
make your way through the no longer trapped
chambers still tenuously held on the various
pressure plates
 As you guys are having this conversation
you continue up the spiral staircase coming to
where the wall had been blown down and then
cleared out for you guys to enter There as you
hear the familiar sound of rushing water you
climb out back into the much cooler air flow
thats blowing through the subterranean tunnel
There your two boats are still affixed pulled up
onto the edge of the river
 So whos taking which boat
 Yasha and Caleb on one side
 The rest in the other
 Are you guys going up back where you came
 The river continues going yeah It forked
ahead where you were
 Correct but its not a strong current Its
a lazygoing current but you could row up Its a
little harder to do
 You could It would be tiring
 Make a survival check Nott
 You would because of your feat
 The two of you know that in the time you
spent traveling down here in the subterranean
area resting and going through these battles
and you left midday Its when you had arrived to
begin your journey here Its getting pretty close
to dusk Not quite yet The sun hasnt set
 Yasha Nott and Caleb are staying behind
 You keep watch The four of you guys
 The rest of you get into one of the boats
push off catch up onto the current and begin to
lazily drift further down the cavern
 The light picks up and spells out the
interior of this chamber
 You guys travel for about ten or  minutes
down before another cavern merges with the one
youre in It looks like another side of the river
seems to merge with yours
 Well youre back where the fork seems to
remerge with the path youve been taking As you
turn back onto where that happens what do you
do
 Are you guys continuing to go downriver or
are you going
 Jester turns it around and begins going
against the current and pulling you guys up
 There you go Switchback towards the other
avenue of the fork and you guys continue up
there It takes a little while longer and its a
little tiring For the heck of it make a
constitution check please
 No sweat Youre making it up the river
without an issue Your muscles are holding Its
fine You are a beast
 Eventually the sound of rushing water gets
louder and louder You glance up in the direction
where youre coming from and theres a fine mist
in the air a spray
 It looks like there is a waterfall that you
guys are at the bottom of Its about a foot
drop from above to the bottom of where you are
Youd have to climb to get to the top and you
have no idea how to get a boat up there You get
the sense that if you had gone the other way down
here you wouldve suddenly had a waterfall drop
 Very thin a half a foot to a foot but
there are a lot of stones and rocks that have
tumbled through the river over time and set at the
bottom that wouldve destroyed a boat that had
fallen off the edge of that waterfall
 You can make an investigation check as
youre rowing up to the edge glancing over the side
 This would be more of a perception check
because you cant really investigate Youre not
poring through it
 Theres no place to pull the boat off to the
side
 There are only really the stones here and
theyre pretty slick
 You dont see any remnants of broken ship or
boat
 Yeah its hard to tell in this vicinity
You do see the water crashing down a little so
there are a couple of small platforms on the way
that its hitting and splashing off again The
spray is causing all this
 Well at the moment no From what you can
see in the vicinity you see the water rushing down
 On one end it hits rock Does not

 Theres a little space behind the water
 Theyre not there
 Molly jumps off the boat
 You row the boat You pull through the
waterfall and the boat  The opening is
not wide enough for the boat and it jams up into
the space and gets lodged and the waterfall is on
you guys and in the boat Its filling up the
boat
 Make a strength check
 Yeah so you have advantage because shes
aiding you with this
 What did you roll
  Yeah thatll do it You push away from
the waterfall Actually Im going to pull up some
audio for this because I have it
 There is nothing here unfortunately Its
slick rocks
 Hes swimming making his way through at the
moment
 You make your way through
 There you go Keep it thematic You come up
from underneath and you can see as soon as you
come up and reach out your feet and your hands
both of you guys begin to catch soft river floor
and eventually it comes up to a plateau and this
is a small enclosed chamber in the inside
 It only goes back about ten or so feet
  Its been a while
 Hes folding beer cans into little shapes
Whats an alhoon to do Anyway you guys come out
of the water and quickly glance as your hairs
drenched on the sides of your face except for
you Its short enough hair On the inside its
fairly empty except for a skeleton A humanoid
skeleton against a back wall that is laying there
It has manacles or chains attached to its wrists
neck and feet and theyre all connected by a
singular chain in the center and its resting
there and its probably been here for a while
 Make an investigation check
 I mean the bodys pretty rotted It looks
like whatever clothing theyre wearing is very
basic material that is It would be more
disintegrated if there wasnt so much moisture in
the area and it looks like bits of it have been
eaten away with fungus and mold over time The
manacles are very well made and looking at the
edges where they connect theres a small rune at
that point
 Make an investigation check
 Glancing around the interior of the chamber
unfortunately there are no secret compartments or
any alcoves It looks like whoever was in here may
have been an individual who escaped from a boat
that was unprepared for the fall and whoever was
rowing them down this chamber either didnt
survive or didnt know about this hidden alcove
and this individual was in here until they passed away
 As you do the whole skeleton implodes
entirely and the manacles slip off as the
different joints pull apart and alleviate the
manacles Now youre holding the center chain so
you have the neck ring the wrist and the ankle
rings all dangling from this cluster of chain
youre holding
 It appears to be human Make a medicine
check
 Looking at the features of the skull
theyre a little bit more delicate than an average
humans skull You get the sense they may be of
partial elven blood Not full elf but partial elf
 Make an investigation check when you came
back in the water
 Sure You guys both go down there You roll
twice with advantage then The help action
allows you to
 Looking down below there you do see at the
bottom mostly covered in masses of soft dirt and
silt pieces of broken ship and amongst the
jagged rocks it looks like more than one A few
ships have met their end at the base of this
waterfall definitely Beyond that you dont
notice anything of use You do find a rusted
shortsword and a couple of broken pieces of boxes
but anything that was left at the bottom of the
waterfall seems like would have been recovered
Anything of worth someone must have come back for
and sifted through because everything down there
is rotted wood and things that werent useful
 Okay You guys break the surface and climb
back into the boat
 As Fjord  over the side and you
see the chains on the inside
 Whatre you guys doing
 You guys make your way back fighting the
current Go ahead and make another constitution check
 Jesters powering through no issue You
guys make it back You join the rest of the crew
You see a mildly damp Mollymauk Actually the
whole crew is damp at this point from being under
the waterfall
 At this point in time with the searching it
would probably be close to an hour or so
 For what you can yeah Youve read
everything in the journal you can make sense of
 Well do you have another spell slot for
Tongues Well for Comprehend Languages Not Tongues
 Draconic
 Yeah you cant cast a spell and then
remember the language He has to actually
 Yeah Just piece by piece All right Now
that youve rejoined with your compatriots
 All right You guys take the boats back onto
the side Where are you resting here on the side
of the river
 Its a ritual spell
 All righty youre fine
 Then youre good All righty
 You guys pull the boats up on the side head
back inside Where are you going to set up camp on
the inside of the chamber
 You can do that You guys set up a small
camp area take whatever bedrolls and materials
that you have to do the best you can to set up a
space to sleep You find enough of a division in
the floor to at least get to a resting point and
you guys begin your evenings long rest Could I
have everybody at the table except for Fjord
please leave and go take your break a little early
 The sleep takes you and the darkness of your
dream state alleviates you of the stress of the
day Your aching muscles turning numb your
physical form and consciousness now removed and
aimless in this dark space You look down at your
hands and there you see clasped in your grip the
hooked and curved blade that you had recently
bound with In your grasp you swing it and slowly
inspect as you do As you swirl the blade around
in your hand it almost has a trail around it As
you hold it coldly in you grasp this yellow light
suddenly emerges in front of you as a familiar
large yellow eye now looks upon you A voice
fills you directionless Consume You glance at
the blade and back at the eye and the voice again
says Consume What do you do
 What do you do Fjord
 Its about this wide in places It comes out
and it arcs and curves and has jagged edges on it
 Its cold to the touch of your tongue the
blade completely absent of any temperature
 As you begin to force it down your gullet
you feel the edge of the blade hit the back of
your throat and a moment of pain hits you as it
begins to cut through your flesh At that point
this ravenous hunger begins to build on the inside
of your stomach Though the pain tells you to pull
away you continue to force the blade down As you
pull it down from the hilt you feel the blood
burble up in the back of your throat and spill out
of your chin but you continue to push it until the
entirety of the blade is consumed within your
throat You close your eyes for a moment and look
up at the eye once more The voice returns to
fill reverberating around you The pain subsides
and it says Good The eye closes The lid
completely cutting of the source the cold the
liquid the water around you the sense of being
under the ocean again begins to whisk you away A
heavy current begins to pull from behind and you
reach out trying to grasp for any hand or foot
hold Yet you have nothing to hold on to As you
feel yourself being dragged into this endless
abyss the dream comes to an end You wake up
 Everyone else is asleep in the area No
one seems to have woken up from your presence
 Nothing in your hands no
 Wipe your mouth Theres a little bit of
blood right there across your hand
 You do and as you summon it there before
you is not the Wastehunter Blade but the falchion
now returned to grasp with a strange more hooked
and jagged appearance to it It seems the essence
of this pact has consumed the weapon you had bound
with and made it one with the falchion you made
this pact with oh so long ago
 At the moment no
 Thats where well take our break

 The wind blows through the distant tunnels
above and for a minute you all shiver as the cold
wind finds its way down below Except for you
youre fine
 Are you guys taking the same boat
arrangements
 The two of you are helming it You know the
time of day even though you are below the
surface keeping tracking of this because of your
feat Its roughly six in the morning Its very
early because you guys went to bed fairly early
You guys begin to make your way up the river now
going against the current muscling your way up
and up further and further still You come across
the area where you had the initial confrontation
with the darkmantles and begin to push and push
 Make a strength check both of you guys
 Yes
 All right As you guys continue to go
forward Yasha pushes on manages to gain ground
Jester while doing fine yesterday trying to do
the advanced pushes youre still making it up the
stream but youre still a little sore from the
night before
 Yeah However youre not making any loud
noises at the moment As you glance up none of
the darkmantles you look up and you can see now
there are a few that are adhered to the ceiling
but they dont seem to have noticed your presence
yet As youre rowing through youre falling
behind You manage to get through unnoticed and
actually way above the one boat I need all the
rest of you to make stealth checks Shes not on
your boat which would be Jester Beau Molly
 I know
 As you begin to row past to continue quiet
as you can and with sound of the oars it matches
the slow its a little bit of volume based on
the river flow but it doesnt seem to cause
enough of a ruckus to draw the attention of the
darkmantles above and the two earthenbased stone
and vine creatures that you had originally seen
emerge dont seem to notice your presence as you
slowly make your way past this part of the tunnel
eventually catching up or at least a little bit
behind Yasha and their group As you continue
forward I need both of the boat rowers to make a
constitution check please
 Yasha constitution check please
 A seven You gain a point of exhaustion
Going against the stream in itself and pushing up
and with the extended push of your muscles to get
through that last bit its beginning to take its
toll on you and your muscles being to seize up
 You gain a point of exhaustion With that
last bit you guys manage to make your way up the
rest of this underground river It takes a little
while but eventually you see ahead the dull green
glow of the various small lanterns that were
affixed to the interior of the river cavern
entrance and there you can see the docks on the
side As you approach waiting for you sitting in
the same position up there that older
crustylooking fella named Rodel who you had met
on the way out and Kara leaning against the back
wall
 Looks like shes asleep in the corner
sitting in a small chair and not
 Oh Oh youve returned Rodel He wakes
up  They eventually get over there and
help you get the boats over there They tie off
the ropes and you guys make your way up out of the
water out of the boats and onto the dockside
She goes Youve returned I see that you arent
any worse for wear How did it go
 Fair enough Well lets get you back there
and talk to the boss if hes awake He should
be She pulls out the blindfolds again passes
them out
 I understand that but this is the bosss
orders Im sorry
 I dont think you understand Its the
bosss orders I cant just go against them
 Thank you Please She passes out
blindfolds to you guys You figure out an order of
making your way down and as you made your way to
this portion of the cavern you walk back being
lead by Kara through the Underworks
 Same path as you went last time not as
busy Nobody else is walking through the halls
Its early enough where there isnt much You do
come past that chamber before where you saw the
cages in there and theres two more cages set
inside even larger One of them is a heavy meshed
series of metal You dont hear anything in
there
 Make a perception check for Frumpkin
 With disadvantage
 You do not unfortunately Its too dark in
the distance at this point Its too late
Eventually making your way up through a series of
steps to a ladder and then you all can take your
blindfolds off You recall being led down to this
chamber At this point Kara says Were almost
there She climbs up the ladder and opens a trap
door that leads into a small chamber You guys
follow her up inside a storage room where there
are sacks of food and barrels of all sorts of
alcohol ale water and whatever else materials
are being kept down here Going through a door not
but two feet from that open hatch into the
familiar interior of the true Evening Nip tavern
 Did you leave your moon sword behind Or do
you still have it with you
 No its up to you Meaning if you have the
sword that you had in the sheath that the moon
sword was in right now or at least tucked in
there briefly because its a little wider than the
sword you had previously had so its going to
carve through Itll hold it but the scabbards probably
 Barely Just barely Id say you can
probably get that in there
 Just making sure we knew about that As you
enter the chamber the light is lower It looks
like only three of the interior torches are
currently glowing There is no barkeep at the bar
and there are no patrons in there The ogre
guard is there in the corner Looks a little
groggy and recently come to consciousness and is
feasting on a whole side of pig that has been
cured and salted It hasnt been butchered
literally tearing off the bone of the half of the
pig and sees you enter and  and continues
eating On the balcony across the way as soon as
you enter you can see at the top there is the
female goliath Sorah who is standing there and
looking down at you as you enter and gives a head
nod of acknowledgement Kara goes Sorry Sorah
Is The Gentleman awake Theyve returned Like to
talk to him please Sorah turns around and pulls
open You can look behind now what little bit of
light there is a drawn heavy curtain that blocks
the interior behind and goes Boss the Nein
have returned Some voices on the inside and a
voice goes Ah Just a moment Im sorry Got
some business Then coming out from behind the
curtain you see The Gentleman in this long deep
purple silk robe that is tied around the waist and
goes  Well youve returned
 Indeed Well have a seat please 
 Some food please
 Bacon please Get these friends some
bacon My god Ill be right down He goes back
into the chamber You hear some other voices and a
slight giggle and then Sorah enters the chamber
after him A few moments pass and then one of the
doors on the bottom area opens up and Sorah steps
out holds the door aside and The Gentleman whos
still in his robe but now has pants and boots on
enters the chamber and goes  Well
early risers Im not going to lie we were sad to
see you not return sooner and had assumed that
perhaps you had not survived so this is a great
gracious celebration of your return He goes and
sits down behind his usual chair
 What Was having breakfast Anyway Youre
alive a little worse for wear I see some scuffs
around the edges Tell me all about it What did
you do
 I did not but good to know
 Right
 Thats terrifying
 Make a deception check

  Really
 He pulls one out Inspects it
 Of course Im a collector myself Its
fine This is beautiful make This is
preDivergence as well 
 Oh most certainly To the right people
they can be worth quite a bit
 All right You produce the candelabra
These six rings you say
 Make a deception check
 He goes Well thank you for your honesty
Anything else He gives a very intense look
across each of your faces You would like to
inform me that you found encountered any
warnings Were going back in after there to clear
out whatever remains behind so we want to make
sure were prepared
 Of course We know of that
 Right but within this facility itself
 At this point food begins to be brought
from the far kitchen You can see the person who
had just woken up has been rushing to make
whatever meats are available and has been cooking
The smell begins to permeate and its coming out
piecemeal as theyre ready
 All right Is that all I would like to
specify that I despise falsehood and our
relationship is based on honesty and trust
 What was in the pit
 Anything else
 So there was nothing else
 Is that all you found and recovered
 Hes done business before and is looking
very intently across all of your faces
 Youre dodging my question That doesnt
make me comfortable That doesnt make me trust you
 Youre telling me thats all you found
 Nothing I wish to be informed that that is
the end of your recovery
 Im going to go out on a limb here and
inform you that as much as you try to doublespeak
me that Ive been a master far longer than you
have
 He catches it
 All right Thank you
 Is that all of it
 Make a deception check
 Ill say sure Ill give you advantage on
this Because you both
 Shes rolling
 We didnt think this through At that point
he sits back comfortably Very well Thank you so
much Im impressed I am happy Keep the rings I
said you can take something back with you and
youve done your job Youve proven yourselves
very trustworthy Please at your leisure Take
solace in knowing that your friend Horris is
safely on his way to Berleben
 Safely
 Make an insight check
 Hes being completely honest
 Of course He snaps his fingers and over
by the curved stairway that leads down in here
two gentlemen that were sitting there in the
shadows unseen before sit up He goes Go on
and they both get up and leave up the stairs He
goes Ive now initiated my means of getting you
folks and most likely Dolan off the hook for the
murder of the HighRichter It may take some time
a day or two maybe more but have some faith in
my abilities Just lay low for a few days if you
dont mind
 If all goes well you wont need it from
me With that I call that a bargain met on all
sides Wouldnt you He takes a little piece of
burnt pork off the table Congratulations You
have my favor Mighty Nein He turns to Fjord
If you ever need me come find me If I should
need you Ill find you Now off I have to
finish my breakfast and my breakfast
 Oh yes of course We keep those for anyone
we do business with Sure Standard procedure Im sorry
 He just stares
 Of course Be safe Finishes his meal
glaring at Nott on your way out As you guys exit
the bottom of The Evening Nip up into the proper
top of the tavern you step out Looking out you
can see the morning sun has risen Its still
early morning at this point in time Its probably
eight oclock in the morning at this point
 Dolan was left at his home Thats the last
you saw just him at his home
 As you guys begin to walk along the streets
of Zadash here in the morning air the cloud cover
in the sky still gray sunless cool You can see
the mist of the town is now finally burning off
but the gray day is still cool and welcoming
Youre going to Dolans house You make your way
towards Dolans trying to still dodge too much
attention from the crownsguard which
thankfully
 Not too strong at this point They still are
trying to prevent people from entering and
exiting but there are still patrols that go
through You make your way carefully through this
point in the morning towards the exterior of
Dolans hut
 You guys come up to the exterior of Dolans
home Its dark on the inside
 A moment passes and the door lock clicks
creak Dolans head peeks out Gentlemen its
good to see you What news have you
 Of course
 Of course Ill see what I can do Things
are a bit tense right now of course
 Of course How is Horris
 Oh thank god
 To Berleben Thats far enough away I
think from any influence here Thank you Thank
you so much
 I hope so
would be nice if one good thing could come of it all
 That would be Id like to see a turn for
the right in this city or another at least
There is right in this city There are good
people As terrible as the death of the
HighRichter may be in essence I think much good
may come out of it in the long run
 We shall see Anyway you musnt be seen
dilly dallying along at this home just in case
Thank you for the update thank you for Horris
and good luck friends I do hope we meet again
soon in better times
 Closes the door locks it behind
 Are you guys heading back to The Leaky Tap
 Okay As you head back to The Leaky Tap
people are starting to come to consciousness and
exit the building The street becomes a little
more bustling One of the barkers one of the town
criers that you had seen before when you arrived
begins coming down the street and begins doing
his shouts Harvest Close comes on the third of
Fessuran Harvest Close comes on the third of
Fessuran and continues walking past
 You get closer to The Leaky Tap and see
another female
 Another town crier comes by younger female
with the big tabard and the scroll as she walks by
says Conflict at the Xhorhasian border grows
violent Watch your children at night
 Conflict at the Xhorhasian border grows
violent Watch your children at night She
continues walking
 She looks back at you Im just reading the
paper
 Its for me to read from I have one
No
 On this it has the Xhorhasian note and it
has the Harvest Close coming the third of
Fessuran Those are the two notes of the day
 Thats my job
 Ah
 I dont know
 Make an intimidation check Sure
 With advantage
 
 No at the Victory Pit Its in the
Pentamarket probably I dont know
 The third of Fessuran is about five days
away
 You guys return to The Leaky Tap and well
say for the time being were going to have a few
days of downtime If theres anything specifically
you want to do thats not storycentric
 All right What are you selling
 None of the rings have gems Theyre all
base metals like gold and silver
 If you want to try and hock some sure
 They are
 You can do that What do you want to do at
Rens
 Okay You spend a little bit of time
watching Its still a functional physicians
practice People still need a physician You cant
tell from a distance if its darkened by the
arrest of Lord Sutan but you cant imagine its
gone well within the family house Its still a
functional facility Its still one of the finer
places to go for medical purposes
 Yeah easily enough You walk into the main
area and one of the clerks there with the same
white robes approaches Can I help you sir
 What do you require of the Doctor
 Make a deception check
 He goes Im sorry to bother you there
sir but hes not in at the moment but we have a
few of the clerks that could help you
 His eyes go wide We have no business
 Very well Ill go fetch him He walks
past you out of the
 He walks around you and exits the front of
the facility and begins walking down the road out
of sight
 Make a perception check
 Okay Beelining straight to the nearest
crownsguard
 A moment later two crownsguard come
rushing blades drawn behind the clerk whos
pointing towards the front of the building and
they rush past you in the interior and begin to
look around They both split on the inside and
begin going through the different rooms It seems
not only did he not believe you but dropping the
name of the Myriad in a public space like that
thats immediate call to the guard for these
guys
 For the most part the places of worship
theyre not very prominent Theyre not huge
temples Theyre kept here out of law that was
decided upon but theyre nice They usually have
a handful of crownsguard stationed to each but
its not like theyre under intense watch There
arent a lot of worshipers during certain times of
the day
 Of all of them I would say it would be the
Ravens Den which is at the Ossuary Gates which
is the large vast graveyard of most of the
higherranked families of this city The Matron of
Ravens temple is the one thats least attended
largely because dealing with death its not as
bright and welcoming to the common folk
 Okay You wait for a while and see a moment
where it is relatively calm The outside of the
shrine is this iron obsidian archway that
stretches up about  feet to frame a small
shrine topped with a statue of the Matron and
her ravens about her this circle of ravens that
curves around You see the female figure standing
in stone the sculpture of the porcelain face
the only material thats not the same as the
darkened stone around her its a white porcelain
mask that is affixed to the front of the statue
At the base of it you can see a number of bowls
and offerings that have been left around from
people that have come and passed through Beyond
that there is a door to the small shrine behind
it its this small structure Maybe  feet by
ten feet Its not a very large shrine Youve
seen groups of people that function as morticians
in long dark robes and dark clothing that have
entered and exited this facility You wait for a
while as there is one body thats being interred
at a family plot and then as they all begin to
scatter you see a few other leave and at that
moment the interior from what you can tell is
empty or at least youve watched three
individuals leave
 You can certainly try
 Sleight of hand for the mustache
 As you leap up onto the statue and go to
affix the mustache to it a voice over by the
shrine says Excuse me Excuse me
 You see a pale young man short blonde hair
emerge with a similar dark robe that you didnt
see in the inside of the shrine He goes Could
you please youre not allowed to climb the statue
 I appreciate that Well thank you Its
just considered
 Thank you so much
 I appreciate that
 Please do Please I can pray with you if
youd like
 He sits down next to you and you both
silently sit there on your knees and begin to
pray quietly up to the Queen You watch as one
raven looks down over you both Soon as he looks
up and finishes his prayer he extends his hand
for a moment and it takes off
 Not often but perhaps she smiles upon
you
 All right Well have a good day He gets
up
 At this point the rest of the funeral
procession is now returning to the shrine
 Oh yeah you can tuck it under any of the
various offering bowls
 Now you know perhaps another time you can
come by and try it again
 Anything else you wish to do over the next
few days
 No its a fungal powder
 Skein Ive heard many arguments over the
pronunciation
 No the word is a real thing Its a weaving
term
 Its a fungus Make a medicine check
 It looks to be a fungus of some sort with a
property to it
 Two of them have taken it
 The two of you that have ingested the
skein Ten minutes pass and the edges of your
vision begin to cloud and as you sit for a moment
your body begins to feel a bit weird Nausea
creeps in a bit Then a very faint snow of dust
in your vicinity begins to coat You know the
Upside Down Where theres that weird material
floating around
 A little bit Only for about ten feet out to
you Its a ten foot area around you and the
coloration of your vision in this area becomes a
gray colorless black white and gray tone I
need you both to make a wisdom saving throw
  Okay
 The effects of it
 you resist the hour long
stun it would have held you in as it is not a
healthy thing to ingest under any circumstances
It is a very dangerous substance For the
duration the two of you can see into the Ethereal
Plane out to ten feet
 They can see into the Ethereal Plane out to
a range of ten feet
 Its not quite like that
 As this happens this translucent
piranhafaced serpent scoots by this ghastly
looking angler fish creature like gasping
breathing
 Yeah this is more of a downtime period so
Im trying to get through events
and then Im going to go walk in whatever
direction seems the most interesting shit outside
is in
 In the best interest of keeping a low
profile for the next few days you both wander out
into the city streets altered on
 As you guys begin to wander through the
Interstead Sprawl once again the strange shapes
pass through your peripheral You occasionally
hear this chattering and distant chuckling this
weird alien laughter There seems like drifting
spiritual energy that freezes your blood as you
pass by Its a really uncomfortable sensation
For about an hour or so you wander in this space
At the end of the hour I need both of you to make
a constitution saving throw
 You feel your body begin to grow woozy and
for a second you feel like youre about to
black out and pass out but you catch yourself and
the sensation passes your vision returns to
normal and it has run its course You didnt
discern or learn much and you feel exhausted
Your body is pretty strained by the process
 You get the essence being one whos in tune
with your body and you as well that this is
definitely not a safe substance
 It may have with the right scenario some
situationally beneficial properties
 Its like a crumbled dry almost a
spongy
 Make an investigation check
  Tell me what you know
 You dont glean a lot of details Most folks
tend to steer clear and walk to the other side of
the road when they see you coming What you do get
to hear is that Amongst the Ashkeeper Peaks the
mountains that largely border the south and
eastern side of The Empire to the north there is
that break Thats where the Ashguard Garrison is
and the Rockguard Garrison Thats where most of
the battle takes place Thats the protection
border that The Empire holds to keep the
Xhorhasian hordes and creatures from the waste to
wander in Although many still filter through the
mountains and such Apparently theres been rising
conflict out there
 Assaults on the garrisons yeah Northeast
of where you are Further east more east little
bit north You have a map You can look You guys
bought a map
 Yeah this is throughout a week so if you
wanted to pull the map out
 I dont know where you guys put the map You
have a physical map
 Go get it Or somebody other than the
pregnant woman go get it
 Correct The conflict has been more common
Theres been assaults on the garrison It seems
similar to what you heard wandering through the
street before there have been more whispers of
children being stolen in the night from homesteads
close to the border
 To the east you can see the garrisons and
the gap that leads to the Xhorhasian side
 Anything else you guys want to do
 There are a few facilities in which there is
a parcel system that travels between the larger
cities and can go to outskirt cities but those
are a little more expensive Yeah that does exist
 To Felderwin How big a package For a
weeks worth of travel itll cost you about five
gold not too much
 Its a fairly upper end system to send a
package
 For you guys yeah for the average person
its not cheap
 There is no rush delivery They can only go
by the speed of horse
 Tracking number included
 All righty I think I know where youre
sending it so All righty
 How much
  gold You assemble this package wrap it
up I imagine disguise yourself once more Paying
five gold for delivery the parcel is sent and on
its way to Felderwin All righty anybody else
 Not a party
 Yeah well come back You find Nott
 Yeah Where are you going
 Easy enough to do You go ahead and
purchase enough materials as you need to get your
spells there transcribed Good on you
 Sure enough
 You may Its not going to fetch you too
much because its seen a lot of use 
 Thats wonderful I think in the long run
thatll be a very useful feature but its also
not that uncommon of an object 
 Yeah Im touched by the sun every
morning

 Ill happily give you  gold pieces for
that there sword if you dont mind
 Well thats the nature of business Im
afraid Make a persuasion check if you want
Your persuasion pity roll
 All of your money
 Ill take it off your hands for 
 All right Well find a good home for it I
trust you on that
 No problem
 Your flask is done
 A Flask of Endless Alcohol
 No but itll be an item on your person
tomorrow When I get in there to customize it
Itll be waiting for you
 Quite a headache
 Pocket bacon Its the best kind
 Cobalt Soul Cobalt Reserve is on
TalDorei
 All righty You head to the Archive What
would you like to do
 All right You ask around for a bit Some of
the various monks recognize you on entry and they
greet you with an acknowledging nod You didnt
make a lot of friends while you were here of course
 However you do come across Archivist Xenoth
who as youre asking the question one of the
monks sends you over to Xenoth He goes Oh
Beauregard Its good to see you
 How may we help you
 I can go and inquire Are you here for more
training
 He looks genuinely spooked by the smile and
is like Thats something Manners Thats new
Im proud of 
 Right all right He turns around and
ascends up one of the slowly curving staircases
that is carved through one of the bookshelves You
see a bookshelf that ends and then a further depth
in and theres a staircase that rides up to the
top Theres a second level above Hes gone for
about  or so minutes and then eventually
descends the stairs From behind you can see
Dairon Her dark skin over the shoulders draped in
this long cloakvest similar to the arraignments
you wear but with a deep gray Her athome wear
As she steps down her elvish features smiling
her eyes taking acknowledgement of your presence
approaches you You have called for me
 Of course This way and Dairon walks
past Xenoth goes It was good to see you Beauregard
 Dairon leads you to one of the meeting
chambers which is usually used for research and
individuals that want to quietly read through
books or take notes Dairon closes the door
behind and its just the two of you So what are
the honors
 Good Ive heard You are making a small
name for yourself with your friends
 I dont know is it
 Good Ive worked hard to not be easy to
get you in some doors that otherwise you could
not but notoriety can get you in doors that you
couldnt otherwise as well Either path has its
benefits the choice is yours which to take
  With enough training and
discipline maybe Two things unfortunately you lack
 In time perhaps So why are you here Just
to tell me youre in town
 That is good Im proud of you Do you wish
to train
 I always have time
 All right Dairon leads you out of the
chamber and down below the archive where as you
recall is the subterranean training boxes for the
monks in which you have sand pits you have all
sorts of assembled essentially the word
escapes me A series of things you have to climb
 Thank you An obstacle course my brain is
not working right now at the moment Obstacle
courses and places that are designed to help you
gain more skill in advancing through urban and
exterior vicinities It looks like a parkour park
a little bit but not there in that space you
and Dairon spend the better part of the
afternoon her essentially beating the shit out
of you via these courses showing you some better
placement of your applications of Extract Aspects
hearing tales about the things youve encountered
and teaching you the importance of the specific
bits of information that is most useful in the
heat of battle advancing this training and
giving you a little more focused idea of the path
that you have been taking and the path that you
are going
 She knew that they had come through she is
caught off guard that you had actually encountered
them directly Dairon says Interesting I will
take this into my studies
 Dairon goes from this very cold exterior
For the first moment you see a brief crack of
emotion and she leans in Whatever those things
told you do not trust it Do not take it as
anything but desire to conquer and kill
 Oh Im sure they were looking for
something Do not show pity for these things
 Unfortunately the detailed business of the
Cerberus Assembly is very carefully guarded and
outside of our jurisdiction but were doing our
best to keep an eye in case anything slips through
the cracks They do a lot of good but I dont
trust a mage that powerful
 None that Ive come across
 Keep your ear out If you encounter another
one of these things these objects or at worse
another one of these Cricks bring what it has
bring it to us
 Of course I may not be here in a month or
so
 Im going to travel to Bladegarden See
what I can gather on the front lines With these
conflicts escalating I wish to be informed as to
whos in charge there and perhaps what dangers
might be creeping further into the empire
 Bladegarden is outside of where the
garrisons are yes Its where most of the main
military is held
  Ive survived long enough
Anyway one more round of sparring
 With that you and Dairon continue to trade
blows and continue the lessons throughout the day
 Anything else anyone wants to do
 At this point sure
 Both of you or just you
 All right As you focus on the strange
artifact concentrating on it you feel your
vision drawn towards it Part of you feels like
your bodys leaning forward like youre about to
hit your forehead but Caleb hasnt moved at all
 Caleb hasnt moved but from your
perspective you feel like and then suddenly
you feel like youre within the dodecahedron and
like previously suddenly theres this loss of
light and stars begin to peek out around you
 You see shapes and forms of purples and
blues these amorphous clouds that drift by on a
scale that you cannot comprehend You see darkened
spheres and objects passing you as you drift into
nothing into this void with distant dots of light
and sparkle You get to that point you were
before where you feel like theres a threshold
and your heart begins to race Do you continue
 As you continue past that threshold the
speed begins to increase
 You feel the back of your neck begin to grow
warm and the hair begin to stand up While you
cannot see you can still sense your bodys
presence unmoving but moving so quickly this
duel sensation is conflicting and causing your
heart rate to jump Your breathing begins to speed
up You guys watch as his breathing begins to
increase There you see this faint gray glow
approach and stop Your speed comes to a slow
crawl and then halts There before you you see
this tiny little mote of gray pulsing light a
similar undulating pulse as the dodecahedron
itself  before you What do you do
 No response It looks like its right there
but a foot in front of you
 It is immediacy and forever it is an
ancient concept of possibility As you ask these
questions and begin to contemplate the loop of
your thought process begins to cycle on itself
and you have to shake your head not to be lost in
this infinity that threatens to suddenly disperse
you Still it is this tiny gray thing before
you and it seems to want your contact
 You look down and you can see your hand in
front of you
 As you reach out and touch you guys watch
as this
 You hear him talking You see a faint mote
of gray begin to drift out of the dodecahedron
and then it floats and enters and vanishes into
the chest of Caleb
 Caleb you feel this tiny mote come into
your hand and then you pull it to your chest and
you feel this warmth and for a second probability
becomes slightly malleable This object is still
so much more than what you understand its power
is indecipherable on the scale of your puny
mortal knowledge but you do know that somehow by
reaching out to this device youve managed to
pull within yourself a Fragment of Possibility
 Just so you guys know well hell tell you
when he gets around to it
 Thats up to him to tell in the story
 No The moment that that enters his chest
Caleb pulls his hand from you Caleb your eyes
adjust and youre back in the room with your
friends
 Player privilege unfortunately Hes the
one who that looked into it If he doesnt tell
you soon Ill tell you but
 Once per day it can grant one person a luck
point
 It grants you this mote of energy
 It gives you the Fragment only lasts for
eight hours You can only give out one Fragment
per day so
 Correct yes It could be the same person
every day or it could be a different person It
gives you the chance that this could be used by
anybody in your group
 What do you mean
 Anyone can use it
 The following day through your various
lowkey journeys you catch another town crier
wandering through the town shouting Murderers
of the HighRichter brought to justice By the
crowns protective eye Zadash is free from these
treacherous cutthroats
  I dont know Im just told to
tell this
 
 This is the next morning
 Over the next few days the Crownsguard and
the Righteous Brand which is the name of the
military of the Empire the presence at the gates
of Zadash has dwindled to normal The backed up
caravans and travellers begin to wash into the
city once more in preparation for the Harvest
Close festival now only but a few days away You
watch as strands of linen all of the colors of
autumn are affixed between street arches and
lantern poles a celebratory display far less
fancy but more widespread than the Harvest Close
Gala not but a week before in the TriSpires
Thats where were going to pick up next week

 Were going to pick up at the Harvest Close
festival
 A Fragment Fragment of Possibility
 Well done guys
 All righty so Ill go ahead and get those
custom items over to your guys inventory on DD
Beyond tomorrow
 Well come back next week for a Harvest
Close Festival We get to have a festival
 Those always go well Its going to be
great
 Thats up to you guys Youre more than

 The Mighty Nein in
the city of Zadash Long in the Dwendalian Empire
youve made a small name for yourself in a few
factions Youve done a deed or two for the Kings
Hall here in service of the Crown Youve done a
deed or two with the Knights of Requital that
involved getting caught up briefly in a manhunt
as you were loosely responsible for the death of
the HighRichter the high judge of the local
court Managed to make an introductory trade a
deal if you will with The Gentleman this
subterranean figure of not the most legal of
maneuvers You delved deep into one of the
subterranean river tunnels beneath the city of
Zadash for him managed to clear out and recover
materials from a longburied research facility
from the Age of Arcanum
Upon returning the deal was solid You managed to
smuggle out Horris who needed to be away from the
town for the time being while this investigation
was happening In doing so also managed to clear
your names of the death of the HighRichter Upon
returning back getting a few deeds done now
waiting for this to blow over and hearing word
that there is no longer a manhunt for a number of
you in cahoots to this you begin to prepare for
the coming Harvest Close Festival Now were
getting close to the third of the month of
Fessuran youve all managed to prepare in the
ways you want got a few things on your side
Youve delved into some of the mysteries of the
beacon that you maintain Youve retrieved your
Forever Alcoholic Flask Thats where well begin
today Friends as the early morning creeps up
upon you the chilled morning air has left a bit
of ice and mist crawling across areas of the city
floor from outside your window here in the Leaky
Tap tavern However though it is a gloomy
morning there is already a general air of
celebration around Glancing across more people
are now shifting out into the street and city
around you Music is beginning to creep into the
vicinity and you can hear muffling through the
nearby walls
 As you all awaken hearing this outside
what do you wish to do
 Yep
 Just more understanding of the same notes
you read before From what remains of the tome
you managed to quickly grab the Cliff Notes of it
as you glanced through it and the more
information you pulled from it filled out that
your thoughts on those tidbits were correct
 Yeah theres been a few days You wouldve
had time
 It is the morning You have awoken
 She takes the beacon focusing on this
strange artifact that you procured from the grip
of the Xhorhasian assassin You feel yourself
extend into it and now being your first time to
focus on it its a lot to take in You feel your
essence shift into this space this strange
dimensional between Though not fully
understanding it youre brought the same image of
dozens of yourself and this sense of infinity
There before you you see the strange gray mote
and you reach out in the way that you saw Calebs
hand reach At that moment you feel it shift and
vanish into your chest the warmth sifting into
the center of your rib cage and then your eyes
focus once more and youre back in your chamber
 All right roll an attack
 I mean if youre not dodging
 Yeah then you hit her
 Well its one plus your strength modifier
 You take four points of damage from a sheer
punch to your shoulder
 Okay I think she is dodging this one so
roll for this one
 Ill say youre proficient in unarmed
because youre just punching sure You add your
strength modifier and your proficiency modifier
 She does manage to step out of the way now
being more defensive from giving her a dead leg
 As you ask this question Yasha is not in
the room
 You have a map
 Nogvurot is actually northward a little bit
east of Rexxentrum
 All right so you guys start heading
downstairs Who all is gathering down there with them
 All right everybody Yasha you napped in
the side alleyway in the open air sleeping with
one eye open being careful As you wake up in the
cold morning mist the mist has caused this
dampness around your chin and hair
 Your glorious beard right there Frost
beard
 No It gets really cold in the early morning
and bits of frost have gathered at the edges of
your hair so you brush off it a bit As you
gather yourself and look out past the street the
musics already starting to swell very strongly
from a distance and a few musicians come by
playing on their own Some folks are starting to
rouse and begin cooking things The smell of meats
and fresh morning meals are beginning to find your
nostrils and you decide you probably should check in
 You come in the rest of you all gather in
the bottom tavern area of the Leaky Tap What
would you like to do
 Theres a new female whos running the bar
She is now also coming to consciousness Shes
coming around to preparing the bar Passed out
face down Looks to be in her early s or so
long black hair that goes just past the chest
area
 Respectfully choosing words Laura Past her
heaping bosom What do you want me to say
 Laura Bailey forwardthinking feminist

 Its all right
 Thats not going to happen
 Anyway this female you havent seen before
whos in the process of running the bar very much
in the same way that you saw Wessek the
dragonborn or previous before that Claudia
 Human s long black hair
 What can I get you
 Easy enough to do Ill be right back and
she goes and fetches you a drink All right so
For this part of the festival are you going for
an ale or a stiff drink
 Not in the tavern currently It seems most
everyone outside is walking in one direction
though A lot of the folks that are starting to
gather are all heading past the entranceway and
heading in a leftward path from looking out from
the tavern
 There you go You have seen people walk with
various drinks in their hand without an issue before
 Fjord has left the Schrdingers skeleton
conversation
 Go for it Molly gives chase
 At this point now the chilled late morning
beneath the cloud covered skies the streets are
filled with all manner of people and families
walking with baskets and colored streamers behind
them The large banners of silk of the autumn
colors that were previously being placed up in the
streets are in full display The gentle wind is
causing them to flicker and flap as the music
weaves with the sound of the fabric Small bands
of bards and musicians mark nearly every street
intersection filling the air with music poems
and cheer Its a very stark difference to the
lockdown that held the city over the past week
and a half or so The closer you begin to follow
the crowds as they move along hearing the
chuckles of children and the conversations and
laughter that seem to burble out of every street
corner it pushes you in the direction of the
Pentamarket Thats when the smells of spices and
incense begin to come in waves as you follow the
sauntering crowds eventually that smell overcome
by the smell of cooked meat pies and roasted
vegetables billowing from the various food carts
that line the corners of the streets before you
 The flickering of the wind is now this weird
syncopation thats blending with the sound of the
distant drums and ocarinas and flutes that are
beginning to pipe into the strange din in the
streets You see a number of games of skill and
chance that have been set up in the distance too
amongst the crowds as people begin to weave
through To the left you can see someone loudly
proclaiming Want to play Trebuchet anyone and
down the way another voice calling out Kings
Vault You can see more games in the distance
beyond there More stages are set up with food and
its a veritable smrgsbord of celebration What
do you guys want to do
 The guards are relaxed but theres
definitely a large presence and in fact a number
of the games are run by the guards In fact
Trebuchet as you approach you see two guards
male and female that are both in the process of
lifting a three or four year old girl and she has
a sandbag in her hand Theyre like One two
three and she throws it and it gets close but
stops before the basket but they cheer her on
Yay and set her down
 The kid runs off and grabs the bag and comes
back and they lift her again They go One
two and they give her even more of a swing so
she gets a little more distance It hits the edge
and then tips off to the side and they go Aww
and the crowd who had gathered around Awws with
her The little girl smiles and gives them a hug
and then runs off One of the guards turns as you
guys begin to approach and shouts to the crowd
Trebuchet anyone wish to play
 Five copper for three throws
 Sipes The other guard goes All right
pulls up three of the sandbags and hands them to
you That basket there and that line there You
see that they were in between for the kids reach
but theres about a tenfoot distance of small
thin carpet thats placed behind the line leading
to this open wicker basket thats about a foot and
a half wide You have to throw overhead facing away
 You are more than welcome to try Id love
to see that happen That is not necessary
 As you stand there you take the sandbag and
in a trebuchetlike motion lob it overhead
without quite looking assuming the direction Go
ahead and make a dexterity check with disadvantage please
 You lob it and hear  and
everybody goes Oh and you turn around
 You turn around You can see the mother of
the small kid that was first throwing and shes
rubbing the side of her face
 She goes Ah its fine Looks up at you
and goes Come on She grabs her kids arm and
they both leave deeper into the crowd
 All right try again
 As you one two
 You go to heave the sack and as it does it
gets caught on part of your breastplate and as you
pull upward theres a  as sand goes
scattering into the sky around emptying the bag
and pouring over you into your eyes 
Laughter starts to gather in the crowd around and
some small clapping
 Well you have one more throw
 Which one of you is taking the other
throw
 Oh perfect There you go
 Thats ridiculous
 Jester Yasha How do you want to do this
 They literally shot put Fjord about three or
four feet 
 No He gets about four feet before he goes
face first into the carpet The carpet balls up in
front of him as he skids for another foot foot
and a half with his feet up in the air before
they come to rest Theres a dust cloud Theres a
loud gathering of voices going Ooh and then
silent as the music plays in the distance
 The female guard goes and straightens out
the carpet to get it right Five copper
 Oh thats right Then by all means
 Because youre looking away Its not a hard
DC but
    Whoa The crowd begins
cheering Yeah
 They hand you a second one
 At the end
 Jester You throw it with all your strength
and it goes straight up Hits you in the top of
the head and dangles off one of your horns
 All right
 As it arcs it lands Theres a little poof
of dust behind It only gets about four feet from
you unfortunately
 However we do have one successful in and
they reach over into a satchel on the side and
pull out A fresh strawberry for the victor
 Its actually pretty tasty Fresh sweet
Its delicious
 Oh we dont sell the strawberries You can
buy them further in Here you pay for the
prestige of a victory and a strawberry If you get
all three you get a candied apple
 While this was transpiring you guys go to
catch up while Caleb and Nott have approached the
young halfelven woman who is shouting Kings
Vault As you approach you see she has her hair
tied back and shes barking with this utmost
confidence Kings Vault Come play Anyone come
to the front Show us your majesty of attention
 Well you place either a silver or a gold
piece up and I will and she pulls up three
silver cups I will place it underneath one of
these Mix it around Pay attention Guess the
right one Get your coin back plus one Get it
wrong coin stays with me Simple game
 Yes At least
 Onto the table She takes the center cup
 Cups over it
 All righty That being the case I would
like you both to roll a perception check
 Strangely it does not
 As soon as she finishes the rotation she
stops and goes Very well and you has to be
the right one Has to be the center
 She tips the cup Indeed the silver is
there Congratulations With that your earnings
doubled and gives you a secondary silver
 A silver
 Of course Coin goes down Cups over it
Now theres a small crowd gathering Now people
are starting to watch There was a victory
apparently and some cheers
 She begins shifting and shifting and
shifting and shifting Eyes focused on you
Starting to look strangely at you Very well
Choose Now go ahead and roll a perception check
 You were paying attention All of a sudden
you lost it Looking up at her eyes you were so
caught off guard by her staring at your fairly
wellconcealed goblin visage but seemingly not
enough as she has a curious raised eyebrow That
spooks you for a second You go Oh shit You
lost track of the cups
 Total of  On the perception Okay What
are you going to pick
 Make a sleight of hand check
 As you begin to pull your hands up and
mutter your incantations she goes Ahem No
funny business
 I could tell Ha ha Now
 The middle She pulls the cup back Empty
Aw A good try Scoops the coin off the table
 Well if you have  gold you are more
than welcome to place a gold piece up here as well
 Very well
 Take care of your green friend there
 At this point you guys turn around and you
see the rest of your party has caught up to you
Fjord covered in dry dust
 You glance around keeping an eye open as
you guys continue Youve now hit the deeper edge
of the Pentamarket The crowds around you are
fairly dense at this point There are people
laughing and talking Theyre carrying various
baked goods that are fresh out of the nearby carts
or oven The smell creeps into your senses and
takes over from that point Children run past and
bump you in the side Some are holding two ends of
a streamer and the streamers continue past and
flap around hitting people Its adorable and
delightfully intense The guard presence is very
much felt here but everyone is in high spirits
You get the sense that everyone has been waiting
to get to this festival to this moment here Its
a much different atmosphere than the gala you had
seen a week before in the TriSpires
 Oh there are quite a few mead stands so
its easy enough for you Make an investigation check
 Very easy to find through a couple of
sleight questions to some of the noncompetitive
barkers You manage to find a small meadery stand
thats near the outskirts of one of the large
arena structures that you havent seen used since
you arrived in this city As you approach the
older guy there with this curled and unkempt
chinbeard that looks like part of it isnt
growing on the right side You approach and he has
all this thick dark jugs of mead and he is like
Hey you want some mead
 I have mead thatll get you fucked up
 Might taste like piss still
 He picks up one jug  That one and
hold it out for you to smell Its pretty strong
It smells slightly acrid but not in a bad way
Just in a strong mead way
 Welp depends what you want Do you want
strong or do you want tasty You got to pick
 Thatll be a nice fair filled cup For a
silver
 He pulls up three jugs He says This end
tasty This end fuck you up This one little bit
of A little bit of B
 Grabs the same stuff that Beau got the
heavier thick stuff Pours gives you a cup full
of it Thatll be a silver piece
 Takes it Its strong the aftertaste isnt
too bad Its the initial weird sour vinegary
impact but then the sweetness comes in afterward
It sets well and its strong As you guys are
walking around and keeping an eye you do see
there is another stand that has an elevated
platform called Titans Grasp There are four
soldiers of the Righteous Brand the Empire
Military that are currently manning it Theyre
wearing their plate mail of silver and
darkcrimson design A large cubed stone two
feet by two feet is set on top of this platform
with a metal bar that is wedged beneath it that
its leaning against The metal bar has a
cylindrical center point like a fulcrum There is
a large hammer that one of them is currently
holding to the side As you begin to approach you
see one guy there whos currently spitting into
his hands grabs the hammer  As he hits
the metal bar the stone goes 
barely shifts He sets down the hammer and
Steps down off the platform
 You approach the four soldiers that are up
there One of them comes up to you the one who
has the hammer at his side after retrieving it
from the last person goes Hey all right are
you willing to play some Titans Grasp eh
 All right its five silver an entry
 Single swing but winner gets the current
pot Which stands at and he turns to one of the
other guards who goes through a small bag and
goes Thats going to run about  gold
 All right one swing You
 One swing for you
 Take as many as you want No ones turned
it over this morning yet
 Whos going first
 Oh I like that Your friends got
confidence in you All right big missy Hands
you the heavy hammer Its not too heavy in your
grasp
 Its not very well balanced either Its not
a battleready hammer its designed for this type
of a show experience You get the sense this
hammer would not be the most effective for this
It might be intentional Its your turn people
start gathering Youre up on an elevated two foot
platform there They have the metal bar fulcrum
all set beneath the stone Hammers in your hands
what do you do
 This is a strength check yeah You have
advantage while youre raging Roll twice take
the higher and add your strength modifier
    You hit the
metal bar the stone  falls back into
rest Its a heavy stone
 The stone is resting on the lower part and
there is a fulcrum round centerpiece to it Youre
trying to hit on this end to push the stone to
roll over It moved slightly and falls back into
place Good try That was very strong there
lass Dont worry
 Well pay another
 Oh you did Tell me this when youre
counting this bud Go ahead second swing
 You get advantage while raging so
 You pull back and the one guy is looking
over to one of the mates on the side and starts
laughing Suddenly   larger
impact The stone shifts slams on to the other
side All four of them go 

 Now suddenly the crowd around that you
Looks over to the one guard who had the pouch
Okay then congratulations
 Hands it over
 Yeah go for it You take a moment to count
through while staring at him It comes out to
roughly about  gold worth of silver including
the ten silver that you put into it Or not
including the ten silver so in addition to that
It would be  gold worth but its mostly silver pieces
 All the guards go over and shift the stone
back over onto the fulcrum They pull in and bring
out about a gold piece each to throw five gold
back into the pot They go All right back up
Who wants in
 The guards are going Wait into the
 Yup roll a strength check add your
strength modifier
  As you slam down again
the stone goes  It rolls over a second time
 Seemingly the fulcrum set after you knocked
it over prepared her for a better slam As it
hits the four soldiers of the Righteous Brand
look at each other Were going to take a break
here for a second Return here in about 
minutes They hand the money over to you get
five six gold
 Theyre going to inspect the hammer
inspecting the fulcrum inspecting the stone and
theyre basically in the process of wondering if
they had somehow been cheated out of this They
cant find anything
 At this point now the smell of warm
candied fruit begins to waft past you You glance
over and can see there is a large cart that is
selling all sort of sweet fruit that have been
coated in sugar Some have a sticky syrup
exterior and there are candied apples available
for purchase Depends on how much you guys want to
purchase if any
 You can see the older woman whos there who
a little bit portly with a big smile rosy cheeks
pulls from behind the counter Theyre still
cooling off You can see a small tray that has
about six caramel covered apples that you see are
still gleaming in the little bit of light thats
coming from the cloudy sky
 All right thats going to be
 Two copper each For seven thatll put you
at  copper
 Theres six caramel apples here and you
have seven with you
 Candy apple all right for you and the six
for you  All out of caramel apples for
the time being but return here in an hour
 Theres this little girl across the way
whos like
 You approach and she gets scared As you
get closer you can see she looks a little
disheveled Probably one of the less welloff
people of the city of Zadash You dont see a
parental figure in the near vicinity
 Just runs off
 Go ahead and make a perception check
 She disappeared into the crowd
 It does not appear that there is a strong
presence of tome andor book retailers as part of
the celebration unfortunately
 Theres games Theres food There are
celebratory tapestries in the colors of autumn
You see small pressed crests of the Empire that
are used to either hang over your door as a good
luck charm or to use as decor on the interior A
lot of its knickknacks and general collectibles
Most everyone out here its a craft fair on top
of being a celebratory Theres a bunch of random
odds and ends that people collect or purchase to
add to their home interior
 Glancing about you do see the occasional
person of the Cobalt Soul robes but theyre not
selling anything here
 Okay

 There you can see its a long thin cart
thats mainly things on display It looks like
its two wooden dowel rods at each side of this
booth that all push together at the center All
the tapestries are hung over the side on display
for the front end Theres three individuals that
are manning this booth There isnt a whole lot of
transaction going on there Its a little more of
a specialty item in the sense that not everyone
needs to fill their place with tapestries Theyre on display
 Yes actually There is one that is an
insignia or an interpretation of the symbol of the
Platinum Dragon It is silver threads among a
standard skyblue coloring Theres several
different dragon heads that are woven into the
pattern Theres almost an embroidery For as much
as youve known about the Platinum Dragon and the
religion its surprisingly gaudy
 One of the people running the booth
quickly as you see a mids halfelf man with a
bit of chin scruff and very short hair leans
around the corner and goes Oh for the Platinum
Dragon This one was handcrafted by me and my
mate over the period of about two months Hand
embroidered Very difficult Very exquisite For
the entire piece the central piece youre
inquiring about thatll run you about ten gold
pieces We have smaller almost doilysized
renditions of it back here
 He takes the back and unfolds it entirely
but cant quite get the full arm length to get up
there Hes like This ones about six and a
half seven feet from top to bottom Can be used
as a rug should you be so inclined and you arent
quite a fan of the Platinum Dragon and want him
beneath your feet
 Right away He takes it begins folding it
up with one of his other compatriots They take
the twine and manage to fasten it in three
places
 He says Were happy to bring joy to you
and the house of your great deity They hand you
this relatively massive tapestry thats almost
seven feet end to end
 As this is happening you see that there are
two other games Youre now seeing the central
space here Youve walked past this structure
Its this small forumlike circular stone
building thats been emptied and closed Now
theres crowds walking in and out the front
doorway and around it are where a lot of these
games are set up You do see one that has a big
banner that says Eagle Shot There is one large
central platform where it looks like this is where
a lot of public presentations are given here in
the Pentamarket Its currently set up with a
central table and a number of members of the
Righteous Brand as well as one that is a very
welladorned human male with brown hair thats
pulled up into a topknot He has a big thick
beard Looks like a handsome fellow and hes
currently barking out something about the
military Youre too far away to make out the
details of it That one has a wooden carved sign
that says Soldiers Spirit Its currently put on
the edge of the stage
 The Hearth of the Allhammer would be on the
other side of this large forumlike structure
 Eagle Shot yes
 As you approach there are two crownsguard
that are helming a small compact archery range
Theres a series of trees that are at the very
back that mark what would normally be an alcove in
this small park but within this alcove there are
three archery targets that are slightly off from
each other at different distances They have a
rack with different bows and a whole cache of
arrows that are set to the side
 The first guard turns around Oh little
girl good to see you What can I help you with
 What do you  Which you still have a
bolt nocked in this hand crossbow Hes like Put the 
 Little miss you shouldnt be waving that
around in public Im not sure how you got a hold
of that Wheres your mother
 Unfortunately by the rules you have to use
one of the provided bows
 Please put sir your daughter is a danger
to the general public right now
 Well she has not been trained proper use
of that in a space in which is it safe for other
people to be around Im just saying
 Could I see that for a second
 Takes it the crossbow and pulls the string
back removes the tension hands it back There
Would either of you like to play some Eagle Shot
Behind them somebody like
 The other guard behind is currently setting
up an older woman who is in the process of getting
the arrow lined up and it keeps falling out of
her grip and the other guards like No put it
here and getting ready Finally fires an arrow
and it goes and disappears past one of the trees
Oh no
 Very well Thats one silver piece for
three shots Closest bullseye if acquired you
get a rat from a cage He pulls off from the side
here you see a small stack of wicker cages with
rats inside them Get yourself a pet rat If you
go ahead and get that middle bullseye about part
way across that range there you win yourself one
of these finely crafted wooden swords They have
this decently whittled wooden sword The center
cross hilt for it is strapped with twine tightly
Swings it a couple times and sets it down lays it
against and it rests and hits the ground off to
the side Now the farthest one over there and
you watch as the old woman pulls another shot and
it almost hits the far target before it gets stuck
in the tree about ten feet behind it Hit that
one way back there and that one will get you
this He pulls up a haphazard stitched doll with
button eyes like the stitches are too wide so it
looks like the crosses behind it are visible
Theres no mouth Theres like matted twine hair
some feltlike material thats made a crown and a
cape Of our fine King Bertrand Dwendal
 He gives you a look like you said a bad
word He goes I suppose
 He glances back Its probably about 
feet
 It is an attack roll and its a short bow
He said about  feet but the farthest ones
about  feet Which means it is in its second
range increment so the one in the back is at disadvantage
 Well lets go ahead and see Rogue
proficiencies Its a simple ranged weapon You
should be Im pretty sure you are Yep simple
weapons You are proficient with the short bow
Whos going first if you dont mind me asking
 Of course understood Hands you one of
the short bows off of the side and three arrows
Theyre all right in their construction
 Oh I
 No continue
 Which target are you aiming for
 The farthest All right with disadvantage
Add your dexterity modifier
 I do not think youre proficient
 Well as a wizard you might be actually
For simple weapons
Nope No you are not
 Well its simple ranged weapons but those
count as simple weapons
 It gets about  or so feet before it gets
stuck in the dirt Hes like That was good
 You nock your secondary arrow Take a shot
 This one gets about five feet further and
almost hits a squirrel You hear  and
it darts off into a nearby bush
 This one gets  feet which is halfway
there before it hits the ground and sticks into
the dirt As soon as it finishes theres like a
That was good Go fetch that The other guard
runs out and grabs the arrows to retrieve them
 That is surprising Well a fine Harvest
Close to you friend and for your daughter
 Hands the bow over and a set of three
arrows
 Proficiency and your dex mod
 This one arcs It almost gets near the
target but ends up veering off to the right and
ends up vanishing behind one of the secondary
targets near the tree He says Yeah that was
better than your father
 This one hits the actual base of the far
target Misses the target entirely but it hits
the actual plank of wood thats holding it up
 It hits the bottom of the target No
bullseye but you hit it Hes like That was
actually very good
 Right away little missy Grabs three more
arrows
 One silver for three shots
 Six more shots all right There you go
 As you pull back perfect bullseye into the
farthest target Theres this brief pause as the
guard spins around and goes What 
 Middle one is not at disadvantage
 Both arrows were talking like Disney
Robin Hoodstyle one arrow next one splits the
first arrow The guards still recovering from the
first bullseye hes like What
 Both hit at the same time The guard looks
slowly over towards you Well done
 Heres your doll
 Two swords
 Two rats
 You now have in your inventory
 two rats in
rat cages two wooden swords
 A handstitched doll of King Bertrand
Dwendal
 While this is happening Jester you make
your way around the large forum and there you see
the Hearth of the Allhammer Youve passed it
before and you can see its the domed iron
structure Its been left to rust a bit at the
edges The tops of the dome are polished where
its easily accessible but the very peak of the
dome is a little bit red brown rusted There are
a number of open arches in the inside and you see
the large central forge that marks the center of the temple
 You do see the large anvil that marks there
has the symbol of the Allfather printed on each
side and acts as both a ceremonial anvil for the
creation of religious artefacts and items as part
of worship and as the central statue for worship
itself That is the closest thing there is in this
temple to a central focus of worship
 Its not busy on the inside because right
now everyones focus is on the actual celebration
There are three individuals that are manning the
interior of the temple one of which is the
herald Each temple in the city has a herald
thats the keeper of that temple Its a female
dwarf dark brown hair and three long braids that
trail past to the middle back with a chainmail
robe on that descends past the knees and is
currently sitting on a bench and eating dried meat
out of a small pouch and people watching as people
walk by the temple Nobodys in there actively
worshipping at the moment
 Do you go in trying to avoid attention or
are you announcing yourself as you arrive
 As you walk in a voice in the corner from
the direction of where the herald was goes Miss
if you need something dont be afraid to let me
know Were just sitting around
 Of course
 What do you disguise yourself as
 You
 No thats not an extension of
 Okay As you come around the corner and make
your way in you saunter in the far end of the
temple through one of the arches that marks the
interior come in through the shadow and the
herald once again goes If you need something
right over here
 All right thats fine Goes back to
 already seems taken aback by your
presence What do you want to do
 Well I mean theres people in there
 Theres the herald whos sitting in the back
eating on the opposite end of the anvil and
theres two other folks that are on the outskirts
of the arches looking out into the crowd just
people watching
 As you begin to pray the two others that
are on the outside whove noticed you enter
their attention doesnt wander to you for too long
before they go back out to the celebration people
walking by and people watching in general Youre
on the opposite side of the anvil from the herald
whos still chewing on her meat What do you want
to do
 Just for the sake of presentation because
youre doing this with a bit of haste knowing
that youre under pressure Go ahead and roll a
performance check
  As you quickly begin to finish this
heart Traveler was here you hear 
across the way from the herald You stop for a
second no reaction Continue going You finish
up the art piece One of the other guardians of
the temple begins to turn around and walk back
towards the herald and you pull back for a moment
but they turned away from you and it seems that
youve managed to go this far without being
noticed You finish up your last heart the
exclamation point and the underline of the
Traveler
 
 Just  You put the pamphlets
there on the side slip them beneath the offering
bowl at the base of it
 Make a sleight of hand check on that one
 Because that will be creeping into the view
of the herald
 As you place it on top the voice on the
opposite end goes Do you need help there
Dearie
 As you get up and start walking away the
herald stands up and begins walking towards the
other side of the anvil
 Theres like speedily running granny into
the crowd and as you get
 Drop disguise in the middle of the crowd
 Still in your disguise as youre charging
into the crowd behind you you hear a voice
 That old woman Find her Theres
screaming and you hear this ruckus as people
around start looking behind at the shouting sound
as you dart around the corner Drop disguise and
as you do you can now see the herald and the two
keepers of the temple are now pushing through the
crowd looking searching like Has anyone seen
an old woman Is describing you as best they can
and it looks like theres a bit of commotion going
on As you begin to disperse into the crowd
making your way
 You hear a crunch sound and your hand shakes
for a second and you look down and a mysterious
secondary bite was taken out of the apple
 They have a special relationship While this
is happening you head to the military stand you
said Anybody going with Beau
 You guys approach at this point towards the
Soldier Spear You see this larger platform in the
middle of the Pentamarket There you see the
central military figures wearing ornamental armor
with a top knot There is a table set up there
with these benches and you can see there are two
burly men one who is this hairy heavy thick
woodsman type who is wearing a leather apron and
 Yes exactly Hes like super butch Hand
clasped with a trained soldier whos wearing
elements of the Righteous Brand armor but has
taken bits of it off and theyre both going
 Theyre in the middle of an arm
wrestling match and theyre both tensing back and
forth  before the brawny guy slams the
soldiers arm down to the table He goes
 The crowd around goes 
Theres a shout and cheer and the gentleman in the
center goes That was well done Well done and
congratulations to you Now that youve proven
yourself my friend would you be interested at all

warrior in his own right and the guys like

Xhorhasian evils and keep all these fine folks

points over to the grizzledlooking beastly man
whos currently chugging down the final bits of a
tankard of ale Spins around wipes it off his
beard and stands up Yeah Im coming He gets
up onto the edge of the stage and goes Well

 Sits down at his stool puts his meaty arm
out with the fingers and goes

 Leopold goes One two three Go ahead
and make a strength check
 Yep Just a d add your strength

begin to give to his grasp You see this slight
grin begin to curl underneath his wiry beard as
his arm begins to push you close to the edge of
the table Make another strength check
  With that  onto the table You
lose
 Knuckles a little bruised from the slam He
gets up and is like Ha
 Well done though Beau Well done Here
He hands you a small piece of parchment thats
rolled up and goes This is information about if
youd be so interested in coming and joining the
Righteous Brand
 You can find us at the Marrow Keeps of the
Righteous Brand on the outskirts of the northern
end of Zadash should you be so interested
 Yes
 This is in the area of the Signet Wall which
is the military district of the city
 Anyone else Another gentleman raises his
hand and gets up on stage and they begin to do a
showdown The two of them begin to go back and
forth However that same beastly figure Kendall
still manages to defeat the guy and send him to
the table get up again and Ha Then at some
point shortly thereafter Leopold goes Ah he
returns He returns  Gunther Prast
our finest soldier here in the city would like to
challenge the current standing contender You
watch now as this massive behemoth of a man like
the Mountain from Game of Thrones about seven
foot  pounds guy wearing the Righteous Brand
silver and red armor gets up onto the stage
 Cleanshaven except for this
perpetual five oclock shadow that doesnt seem to
leave his square jaw his hair is trimmed super
short and you see the receding hairline curling
back into a widows peak Sits on the table puts
his arm out there and you can see the huntsman
Kendall for the first time lose his cool You
watch as the two of them grasp together and
theyre going to begin to roll off
 You watch as the hands tighten and with
that Gunther begins to twist the arm further
down further down You can see the huntsman
character is starting to grimace
 However pushes it back in the center Now
theyre currently neck and neck Once again
Gunther pushes him back And with that final hit
Wham Kendall is taken out like 
Grasps his hand and rubs his fingers and darts
off the stage seemingly shamed in front of a
crowd of people Everyones like Oh Theres
now probably about  people who watched that
last match
 He looks human Hes just huge
 Leopold is looking over the crowd goes
Would you like to try your hand at our finest warrior
 Come on up Miss
 Miss  Yasha 
Miss Yasha our new

 The crowd begins to cheer as you step up
onto the stage Everyone begins to gather up
around the space filling in the outskirts You
can see all these faces looking up at you
brighteyed and eager to either watch you get
destroyed or destroy Gunther who is currently
standing with his arms crossed sees you approach
Hes a good over a foot taller than you and
looks down as you walk towards the table Hmm
All right
 Hello Sits down puts his elbow on the
table with a heavy slam
 Grasps you Both your arms
 Hes taking a moment and looking you over
like hes studying something
 Hes trying to make eye contact Moving
around
 As Leopold is talking up this whole this
whole All right come watch now Here is our
finest and it fades away in the background as
Gunther whos leaning forward now says
Interesting styling Ive seen it before
 Youre not from around here are you
 Nothing Just an observation Ive been on
the front lines long enough With that Leopold
walks up and goes Three two Make a strength
check with advantage because he wasnt expecting it

 Natural  No joke No joke Right there
 Beautiful Beautiful Mwah
 As soon as you do that he catches it you
both are caught in the center here tensing up
The whole crowd goes Ooh Everything gets really
tense and quiet as youre both flexing At this
point now you do make eye contact As the anger
is built up inside you Make another strength check
 Well she hasnt raged yet
 Not on this roll you cant because you
already rolled for it Next time you can
 Seven You feel yourself giving way your
arm going further back towards the table You see
this grin across his face His breath smells of
mildewed bread and alcohol It wafts past your
nose Roll a strength check
 Gunther yeah
 You get to roll another strength check with
advantage
 Theyre down like two and a half three
feet because you guys are on a raised platform
Theyre about five feet from you
 Because you are raging
 As hes pushing you down towards the table
you muster up another breath of strength from
inside With that you push him back to the
center Youre both at even keel Roll again
 With advantage
  He starts giving ground the sweat
now beading across his forehead His nostrils are
flaring That horrible smell of his breath is
coming in bigger and more constant waves as he
starts to  He looks up from his grip up
into your eyes once more Roll again
  He slowly brings you back up to the
center Roll again The crowd each time the shift
happens the crowd is like Ooh Ah Oh god
ASHLEY Shit Ten
 Youre losing ground Youre losing ground
Roll again
   He rolled a seven plus five
Right up at the center Roll again The crowd is
going wild right now
 Leopolds like leaning in now watching this
happen
  Pushing him back Roll again
 This is going back and forth back and
forth 
  He pushes you right back in the center
Rolled an  You guys are right there again At
the fulcrum point The crowd is starting to go
completely breathless at this point Its back and
forth Roll again
 Hes starting to breathe really heavy
  You push him back again You can see
now the muscles are straining and popping the
veins are bulging His breaths are getting
heavier his shoulder is looking like its almost
dislodging as hes using his torso to push against
it Roll once more
  

 He immediately stands up and starts shaking
his arm at that point
 Leopold goes Amazing show Yasha and he
runs up behind you and catches up to you As you
step off the stage he steps off with you Goes
Im sorry to bother you Yasha That was an
incredible Have you any interest in all at
joining the ranks of the Righteous Brand
 Oh Well think about it He goes into the
small satchel and pulls out at rolled piece of
paper and says Its a fantastic thing you would
do for the Empire if everyone here You look like
a fine soldier and based on your skills up there
youd be a great help on the front line
 Strangely enough there is no prize for
this There is no buyin Its merely for the
bragging rights of the presentation Its a
presentory
 No it talks about
 Okay
 As you read it

 No It speaks of the Righteous Brand and
talks about all of the wonderful possibilities for
glory Its housing and gear provided its
working in a good teamwork environment to protect
the people of the Empire It has opportunities to
rise through the ranks and to become
 It talks about it pays one gold a day at
start with possibility of raises from there The
training is in Bladegarden and after a period of
training there its three years minimum service
in the military and then you can decide to stay or
not It goes into a small print and says like
desertion is illegal and brings imprisonment and
fines
 As you guys are having this conversation
theres a voice from the side that goes That was
quite an amazing display if I say so myself As
you turn and look you see theres a gentleman
there whos tall a little over six foot very
a gentleman not the Gentleman
 Hes a very strong looking human male with
ruddy tan skin and long jet black hair thats
braided in a single thick braid that goes past his
waist in the back Hes dressed in partial
scalemail across the chest and part of the
shoulders a dull iron color to it thats over his
chest You see a heavy waistband of dull gray
leather thats like a thick almost a foot thick
piece around there and a roughlooking warhammer
thats strapped to his side and he has his arms
crossed and smiling widely at you with a very
welcoming smile That was impressive That guy
you just destroyed up there Hes kind of a
douche
 Whats your purpose here Are you looking
for work
ASHLEY Me or
 Yes you
 Well mercenary work of course
 All right well first off my name is
Darrow
 Whats your name Yasha you said
 All right pleasure to meet you Well I am
the de facto leader of a mercenary band known as
the Stubborn Stock Were out of Guar on the
Menagerie Coast but weve been hired for about a
seven month stint so far by the Empire and its
been paying pretty well Weve had some pretty
good scenarios here The retainers been nice and
honestly its not bad to be paid to sit around in
case they need us
 Well when they need us To kill things to
hunt things down Theres a lot of business that
they cant bring the military to and the
Crownsguard stay in the cities so they send us out
and about Thats only if they need us
 Well its contract You have to be there
for their disposal Were stationed up in Nogvurot
and have been for the length of this contract but
we were able to come down for this celebration and
its been not too bad Its good wage sit around
occasionally hunt down some criminal Xhorhasian
terror thats come down from the mountains Its a
pretty decent living if I say so myself and you
look like a very capable soldier if I say
again
 Sure Would you be interested
  We have no pamphlet My band of
esteemed warriors are planning to be in the
Victory Pit later this afternoon
 We could very much use an additional
soldier of your capability
 He turns and looks and seemingly for the
first time notices the rest of your group Goes
like Oh Im terribly sorry I mean no
disrespect hi but I do not understand that I
do not wish to step on any toes here it was
merely a curiosity What are you called
 The Mighty Nein Very good
 He looks like Thats impressive Thats a
good find Good on you You know who thats
supposed to be
 I was going to say a tiny asshole One and
the same really
 Well were stationed in Nogvurot but
were from a ways further than that
  That has been an occasional
problem yes We had been sent to investigate two
of those instances and in all of them it seemed to
be that they were stolen Im sorry I do not
know how much I can discuss of these with you
 Make a general charisma check Just to see
if he trusts your face
 Weve looked into it Do not worry But well see 
how long the contract goes I do not
know how much luck well have Its kind of a dire
situation
 One of many things
 Well not yet Not yet Just the ones that
come too close in Thereve been a few excursions
into the Empire itself and thats why were hired
Theyre basically bringing everyone they can on
hand to help keep the home fort defended
 What am I fighting Right now
 Oh we havent been to Xhorhas yet
 Theyve kept us in the Empire so far
 Yeah They keep the army on the eastern
side but were meant to find things that the army
cannot be bothered to do
 No actually Weve only really been in the
Empire for the first time this past half year and
Ive heard things about it and you know figured
wed come and try it They gave us a week off to
come down here to Zadash and me and my friends are
going to take our best attempt at this
 Oh well within our person including
myself a grand total of six mighty warriors
 All six of us have our different techniques
yes
  Im not going to tell you and its
not that kind of tournament Anyway I do not mean
to be a problem If ever you change your mind
 He pulls out a copper coin thats a little larger
than a normal piece of copper and goes Just ask around
He tosses it to you and you take it It looks like
a small copper platter coinish in its design and
on it is printed the name of his group the
Stubborn Stock
 Well look for any place in a city where we
might be or might not be and see if youve heard
of us in the vicinity If they know where we are
theyll bring you to us If they dont they will not
 One of our fellows makes them
 Loosely He takes it and shows it off
Its not made that well He goes Its functional
more than its beautiful
 I appreciate that
 All right anyway We have to go prepare
for this tournament If youre standing around
please come cheer us on That would be
fantastic
 A pleasure to meet you Mighty Nein
 He heads off back towards the Victory Pit
 What errand are you on
 Yeah a short jaunt Not too hard to find a
darkened corner where you can do it
 Okay Easy enough to do
 Okay Make an investigation check as you
begin to pore through the crowd doing this You
guys have noticed that Calebs been gone for a
little bit
 Yes
 Wow yeah Within a very short time
asking a few questions and looking through part of
the crowd one of them points over to the edge of
the Pentamarket on the northern side and over in
that direction there are two of the robewearing
individuals One of the monks that works within
the archive itself and one looks to be wearing
higher up robes Youre not sure what that means
or what the ranking is within the Cobalt Soul
 All right as you approach
 The one thats in the nicer dress you can
see is apparently an elven woman You see these
kind of long strands of blond almost silver hair
that goes in front of the ears and the rest of the
hair falls past the shoulders Beautiful natural
no makeup Even for elven standards you can see a
little bit of age This is an older elf in
comparison to a lot of the brighter faces that
turns to you Of course what can we help you
with
 Make a deception check
 Well
 A  Okay Well of course It is open to
the public Youre required to come when there is
an available monk to escort you through the
premises Of course you cannot take anything from
the archive itself but youre welcome to read
while in the presence of one of our various monks
andor worshippers of the Knowing Mistress
 Well the public portions of it yes
 Yes Just need to come on a day in which
the archive is open and available sign in and
you will be assigned one of our various attendees
of the archive and you will have the run of the
public library of which to read and make notes of
You may take your own copy of notes but once of
course it is only within the public space
 Yeah Well Im glad you asked
 Im Jennah Archivist Jennah
 They are a little different They maintain
their knowledge for those who are actually there
as part of the curriculum Youll have to speak to
the headmaster as well They have from what we
know as we are not allowed either quite a decent
cache of arcane knowledge as well There has been
some sharing but they are particular
 That would be Ornit I believe Let me
double check here so I dont say it wrong No
that is no Oremid Hass
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes that was a bit disconcerting
definitely Thankfully it is a welldefended
tower The Zauber Spire has stood for quite some
time and has its capabilities defending itself as
weve seen
 Well you should ask them how they did
that Youll know as to why theyre so secretive
 Well I dont know We always go on
specific business so you can certainly inquire I
havent attempted to go from the standpoint of a
possible student but you could ask
 That is all right
 Of course You as well Happy Harvest
Close
 As you return to the rest of the group you
guys are met by a strangely adorned Caleb with an
interesting ensemble

Pit The crowds are starting to swarm into a
central archway thats open

Congrats Diving back in folks You have muscled
your way through the crowd making your way into
the shaded interior of the front portion the
receiving chamber of the Victory Pit this
twoleveled circular forumlike structure in the
center of the Pentamarket You push in the crowd
and people are starting to find each other and
push away to find seats into some of the openings
that lead off to the sides in the center There is
a pedestal with a barker or an organizer up there
in a long dark gray and brown set of robes a
human male in his late s whos fighting his own
age and losing The combover thinning hair and a
broomlike gray mustache thats poorly colored
with dark wax Hes shouting out to the crowd he
says Please enter slowly the event begins
shortly in the next few hours Would you push
aside  Yes right This way please
but go evenly Hes pushing off two different
directions What are you guys doing
 Im sorry The fights will be soon
 Oh you wish to enter
 Oh entry may have already been closed
 Let me ask He turns around and steps off
of his pedestal and heads to this wooden door
Its about ten feet behind and he shoves through
closes behind him and slams A few moments pass
and people begin filtering through still pushing
past you and bumping you in the shoulders
 The door opens again across the way as you
guys are having this conversation and the
gentleman comes out again and goes Quickly
follow me
 You guys make your way through the crowd and
follow him into this back chamber You enter with
him Theres a slight hallway that leads into a
lowlit lounge with comfortable furniture with
cushions theres some firelight a few torches
set up in the chamber There is a window across
the way that looks out into the open of the
Victory Pits main battle area You can see
servants wandering in similar brown silks and
robes as the barker but theyre carrying trays of
food You see guests in expensive clothing that
dot the distant walls and areas of the chamber
sitting atop these cushioned couches and talking
in low voices to each other broken with the
occasional laugh The older gentleman ushers you
over and waves in the distance as a figure begins
to approach This is another human man in probably
his early s or so who has graying hair that is
slicked back and even further thinned than the
gentleman who first met you on the way in who has
a very well groomed goatee that comes to an
accentuated curve up underneath in the front Hes
wearing a finely tailored dark blue festival
suit
 The barker says These are the ones who
and the older guy goes Ah Its far too late in
the day We couldnt muster a Very well I am
Yadaka Brigman Guildhead of the Filigree House
and organizer of this harvest tournament Who are
you and have you the coin to enter
 The Mighty Nein Where are you from Mighty
Nein
 Yadaka Brigman You are from everywhere
 You will be announced as from everywhere
 Thats all right if that is what you
require All right Well weve warriors from
around the Marrow Valley come to compete today
many of which wholl have been on the front lines
of the eastern wastes Are you still eager to lose
your coin and risk your life
  gold pieces per fighter Groups of
five to eight are allowed to enter There are
three rounds to this tournament
 Each victory is  gold to be dispersed
amongst your group and the winners that remain at
the end split a  gold purse
 Whatever you bring in there is at your
disposal to utilize With your group that would
make four who have signed up for the tournament
today You will brought down to the
waitingholding area and each group will be
brought into the Victory Pit to face off with the
chosen peril
 Four groups You are the fourth to have
signed up
 Of course not Youre fighting a number of
creatures that have been acquired and kept for
this tournament Beasts and things that have been
either found wandering over the ranges of Xhorhas
or have terrorized the local countryside and have
been brought to us by the Righteous Brand for this
sort of tournament
 There may very well be young lass
 Good question
 Well do you wish to join
 Then present your coin What is your
name
 Very well
 Thank you Weve managed to squeeze you in
at the last moment The rules are as such Each
team will face off with one of these encounters
weve developed for this tournament continuing on
if victorious to face another until the other
teams fall you fall or the third round is
completed Should there be more than one victory
team at the end you will divide the purse amongst
you However these will increase in difficulty
the further you remain You will not be allowed
but the time it takes for the other teams to
battle before you face once more Previous years
have shown us no more than maybe  minutes
Whatever you have in each round is what you go in
with Use your time wisely All of this will be
displayed in front of the Starosta the appointees
of the Crown and the elite of the TriSpires
Money and glory is here before you
 We have clerics on hand and outside of
extenuating circumstances weve only had one true
fatality in the past  years of running this
festival so you should be all right
 At this point theres a bit of commotion at
the front entrance where you guys entered where
you see a figure rush in a young human man Hes
sweating longer blond hair past his ears Hes
wearing a very bright gold and red outfit and is
carrying a satchel over one shoulder as he rushes
in and talks to somebody He points over in the
direction and heads up to where your group is
Yadaka goes Im terribly sorry Page The page
looks up What business have you from the Crown
Looking over his attire the page goes
 I must speak with the
Starosta immediately under order from King
Bertrand Dwendal himself Yadaka goes Right
Come with me I apologize Youll have to give us
just a moment He turns around Urgent matters
Enjoy some feasting while youre here Him and
the page walk maybe  feet from you to a corner
where you can see there is a central couch there
where a few figures are sitting and they rush up
 All right so you roll a stealth check for
your cat

 As your cat begins to approach one of the
servants goes You cant be in here and
 Not everyones going to kick a cat into
dust Picks up Frumpkin and begins to bring
Frumpkin away while the page begins gathering a
breath and you now see a very welldressed
halfling with a curled mass of brown hair up top
Its graying and white on the sides who sits up
to meet with another important figure Frumpkin
has been pulled away
 Your cat is being held by a servant
 Being led back towards where you came like
taking the cat outside
 Okay Servants probably confused Whatre
you guys doing
 All right
 There are the groups that are talking and
eating theres the page currently engaging with
the folks and the figure theres a couple of
servants passing around trays of food What are
the rest of you doing You have retrieved your
Frumpkin into your space
 Theres another clap and you see two other
figures get pulled from the other side to join the
conversation by the couch
 Okay make your stealth check with
advantage
 You get advantage because of her blessing
 Okay You saunter up at a relatively close
distance Make a perception check if youre trying
to listen in
 Well the box is an illusion
  Four
 You catch bits and pieces Okay what you
hear is the page hurriedly saying which skies
now darken Brokenveil over  dead the
Ashguard Garrison is taken You hear this
conversation a bit hush to hush and a little bit
of  Starosta peeks in a bit You only
catch the next bit which goes Whats the kings
response Then you hear the page respond and say
formally declared war on Kryn Dynasty and the
wastes of Xhorhas Theres some more muttering
You miss that You miss that
  You miss that
 Yadaka pipes in and goes Starosta to
announce anything like that would set panic and
change nothing We are far from the fight For
now let them have a day to rejoice Well
announce tomorrow You miss the next thing you
miss the next thing The last thing you hear is
the Starosta say Ill send word to General
Grinbreaker and begin preparing her legion to move
east Tomorrow well notify the public but page
return word to Rexxentrum that Zadash prepares to
join the front Now go The page turns and
leaves
 Okay
 Which letter
 Its a pamphlet
 There are at the entrance where you came in
and each side
 Okay You back up towards where you guys
came in and theres a crownsguard there arms
crossed looking up
 I certainly hope so Its going to be a lot
of fun to watch
 Oh which one
 Well I havent seen them They keep those
under wraps Its part of the surprise
 Yeah
  Not us thats above our pay
grade
 Well you probably have to go to the Kings
Hall and sign up for the Crownsguard Kiss ass for
a few years and maybe then
 I dont know Thats once again outside
of my jurisdiction They keep a lot of things
separate intentionally
 Right Appreciate that friend
 Okay
 At this point the barker who met you
originally says Sorry to bother you but theyre
gathering the various teams down into the holding
area Ill have to escort you Please come with me
 As far as the
 Right You look at it and there is similar
design to some of the outfits and the
 Yeah You pick up on it
 You guys are continuing to be escorted down
past Most everyone has filtered into their seats
Theres still stragglers finding their way in and
as the days sun is getting further into the
midafternoon you guys are brought down to an
area that is similar to that lounge area but far
less in its decor and comfort This chamber has
two windowed doors on the opposite side that are
cut through windows that lead into the central
arena You can smell the dust on the opposite
side The interior is outfitted with about three
dozen simple stools that are scattered about a
few tables with cornucopias of fruits and meats
that are set and a few folks you see are feasting
on them There are two stationed healers of the
Platinum House of Bahamut the Platinum Dragon
They are the ones stationed there to prevent folks
from dying and the other combatants In one
corner there are five soldiers of the Righteous
Brand one of which is Gunther who are in the
process of taking large handfuls of food and
eating and getting themselves some energy for
battle As soon as you enter they glance over and
give a bit of a nod of notification Gunther
looking straight to you grabs an apple of some
kind and throws it at you Eat Youll need it
 It looks like amongst them there is one
acting as leader or at least is in the process of
discussing tactics among the small troupe though
you cant hear exactly what he is saying An elven
man with short brown hair and these sky blue
piercing eyes who is in the process of giving
orders to them Then he walks off to the side
pulls a blade out and begins practicing Its this
very elegant almost dancelike blade technique
On the opposite side of the room to them all
leaning against the wall you see five dwarves and
two gnomes that are all wearing black and gold
variations to armor robes They are avoiding all
social engagements and staring mad dogging
everyone else in the chamber As soon as you
enter all their eyes shift in your direction and
they watch you as you step into the chamber In
the center of them you see a gray haired dwarven
women weathered skin and a surly grin as you
approach gleaming these yellow teeth from
beneath who gives a bit of a squinted stare at
you as you pass by You see two battleaxes resting
at the side of her belt hanging off of her
armor
 Then over by the doors snacking and looking
out the window into the pit before you you see a
group of six individuals in scuffed armor of green
and brown with weathered armor and skin that shows
experience and travel Markings and accessories
gives you a sense of inland Menagerie Coast
heritage and there you see Darrow who you had met
earlier in the tournament whos leaning out the
window He turns around as you enter and goes
Ah so you did indeed decide to join Not too bad
Im excited to see how well you do
 I have not but Ive been hearing about it
Im excited to give it my all as you say
 Thats a good question I imagine thats
less of my worry and more of theirs He points
out to the rest of the people in the stands and
goes I certainly hope they have ways to deal
with that otherwise thats going to be a very
unhappy day tomorrow for the people in the city
 That is not cryptic at all Well the
Stubborn Stock are my esteemed mercenary band
Friends this is the
 The Mighty Nein we met earlier at the
places with the games All of them give a nod and
then grunt and reach over and start shaking hands
They seem of all the people in here the most
friendly As soon as this happens the crowd
outside starts cheering loudly The sounds of chaos
begin to build
 The cheers swell and swell You hear feet
slamming throughout the entire event causing dust
to come down off the ceiling above you You begin
to realize that you are below some of the stands
A figure across the way emerges from another
doorway from the right and the crowd goes crazy
This humanoid figure steps to the center Now
looking through the windows you can see this is
an open circular sand pit where there are some
walllike structures in places and pillars beyond
those to break up the interior It has some small
areas for cover and these pillars in the far
corners of each side This figure who walks in is
a tall halfgiant figure covered in tattoos and
spiked armor As he approaches his hands in the
air as the crowds yelling and screaming
 Steps out Welcome all fair peoples of the
great empire under our King Bertrand Dwendal may
his grace bless this harvests end and grant us a
warm winter The crowd goes crazy I am your
humble Jermai Kull previous champion While I
have left the fight I now live for the fights of
others It is my pleasure to bring you this years
great tournament The crowd swells again Some of
the groups behind start mounting up behind you and
everyones crowding around the windows We
welcome our guests of high esteem on this day
Give your applause to our keeper of freedom and
order Lawmaster Orentha Stonegrasp He points
across the way up in the stands The cheers go
bright and you see a figure stand up and you can
see the gray haired dwarf who you had met in the
Kings Hall earlier Shes the Lawmaster of Zadash
who had come out to thank you for the job you had
done in slaying the phase spider in the sewers
She raises a hand and then sits down Make a
perception check as she waves her hand and gray
hair
 Nope
 You glancing there your eagle sight of an
inquisitive monk of the Cobalt Soul glance past
and you can see where shes sitting and there
about two people over sitting in the stand next to
her is a familiar face Pretty sure thats Dolan
 We also bring to this tournament the
Headmaster of the Zauber Spire who repelled the
Crick assault on our great place of arcane
learning Shaping the minds of our future mages
Oremid Hass As the crowd cheers again you see
back a row and to the left a figure stand and
raise a hand Once again everybody roll a
perception check please
 Nine  was the highest
 Who was that
 That was Jester Jester you glance up and
see best you can a figure a stocky dark brown
skinned man with very short curled black hair
across the top of the head very square jaw in
long red and gray robes He raises a hand and
smiles and everyone cheers Sitting next to him
you see a figure that you had seen before You can
make out an older human man with longer gray hair
bald on top This was the mage you saw floating in
the sky during the attack
 Yes white and gold
 None of this would be possible if not for
the love of you and celebration from our esteemed
Starosta Wyatt Fedar There at the very front of
that same area you see the same halfling who was
talking earlier to the page step up on a small
platform to give him a little more height and
prestige amongst this point The male halfling
with the curly hair and the graying sides raises
his hands and give a soft bow and the crowd
explodes and cheers
 This is him Now we begin to bring in our
fighters for this and our first competing team of
the way from Bladegarden The doors open and all
the gentlemen and ladies in the Righteous Brand
armor push past you with Gunther and the elven
gentleman step out into the light Now you can
see the cloudy sky has broken up a bit and there
is a bit of sunlight coming down into this pit
They step out into the center as the emcee begins
to step away He goes May the first fight be a
memorable one He steps back and enters a distant
door that closes behind him They all spread out
and prepare Across the way a door opens and you
see something shift out in chains that are then
pulled off the body and the doors close behind
There you see a foot tall froghumanoidlike
creature with a giant belly that begins to lumber
forward towards them They all immediately assault
this entity jumping in the air vaulting off
sides of the walls assaulting it One gets
smacked in the face it grabs another and throws
it onto the ground Another one rushes up as it
grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight
on top of it one foot pushing it down Gunther
rushes up with a blade and carves into a large
section of its face The crowd goes crazy as it
pulls back and shoves Gunther off with a back
fist The elven leader rushes forward and does a
few quick swipes with his blade The large toad
creature grabs it and attempts to swallow him and
manages to do so completely ingests the leader
The rest begin to assault Make an arcana check
  You dont recognize the creature but
theres something about this entity
 No All right this fight goes on for
another minute or so You watch them trade blows
back and forth Nobody falls and eventually the
general carves his way from the stomach of the
beast with a giant swipe of his blade You watch
as the blood begins to pour from it as he leaps
out coated in saliva and the creatures own
crimson spins around and as the large toad beast
pulls back they all together with one unified
strike surround and attack it The beast lumbers
forward and falls to the ground unconscious With
a rousing cheer from the audience the previous
doors open As the soldiers raise their weapons
high and give a respectful bow they begin to walk
back towards the holding area as they drag the
unconscious body of this creature back to where it came
 The emcee shouts again from the side With
that the banderhobb has fallen
 Next a last minute addition to todays
tournament We bring forth traveled from
everywhere
 The Mighty Nein
 The doors open again and you guys are given
a straight path into the center of this field
 Its okay I bumped it on the way over
 No this was from Mats by Mars they do
awesome stuff
 You guys can place yourselves where youd
like
 Any particular placement youd like as you
guys have a moment to set yourselves up here
 You would
 Blur all right You have a Blur spell on
right now
 You guys entered from this side over here
and you saw the monster enter from this space
 All righty
 What do you want to do
 Sure
 Over here
 The emcee disappears and vanishes into the
back You guys all take a quiet moment looking
around you in silence As the audience gets quiet
still you can see hundreds and hundreds of faces
all staring strangely formless when its a cloud
like this in all directions little beams of light
peeking through the clouds hitting the sand and
dirt on the ground before you In that quiet you
hear  You glance around briefly and see
not one but two doors seem to have opened
 Only one of them has a creature that
emerges It seems like theyre playing mind games
with you so you dont know where its coming
 The door to this side suddenly swings open
and a beast begins to lumber out chains detaching
from manacles on two of its tethered large
tentaclelike arms This grayishbrown mass
probably close to  feet in height with a giant
mouth filled with teeth and a large tongue that
lolls off the side Three tendrils reach off of it
as these large heavy feet pull it forward Smell
wafts around it of feces and rot I need all of
you to roll initiative as this creature emerges
right there
  to 
  all right
 Beau Molly Anybody else Okay  to 
  for Caleb
 All right Nott  to ten Ten to five
 Oh dear
 All righty I believe thats everyone
 Top of the round as this being 
 its tongue slabbering around its open
maw Beau youre up
 Five ten    Yeah easily
 Okay are you driving straight towards it
Or are you coming from a specific angle
 All right there you go
 Okay so are you
 Heres my question
 is this just flavor to
your unarmed strikes or are you actually trying
to damage it with the wooden swords
 All right so it looks like youre fighting
with the swords but youre really punching with them
 Its more for the show of it
 Theyre not that strong
 Go ahead Two attacks
 First one hits second one misses
  points of damage as you hit it and you
feel the actual wood of the sword crack a little
bit but your fist does hit the beast in the side
its giant blubbery nasty body almost slippery
and sticky on impact shifts from the blow Is
that your turn
 Go for it
 Total ten That misses The third blow goes
wide no impact That ends your turn Molly
youre up
 Thats a
 Its a wisdom save but its charismabased
The DCs ten
 Thats a natural  on its saving throw
 Sorry
 All right so you have both blades now
going
 Which rite
 The Rite of the Dawn Okay got it Both of
your blades are now glowing
 There
 That ends your turn Molly It is now the
creatures turn
 Its going to step up right there As it
passes by its going to go ahead and swing one of
its large tentacle arms which you see have these
long curved toothlike protrusions at the end
almost like a slapping squid tentacle It swings
toward you Beau with the first one Natural one
Nope that misses You manage to duck it However
it swings okay that is a  to hit whats your
armor class
 Just hits As the tentacle misses to strike
you it does manage to grab you from behind and
pull you in toward its mouth As it opens and
chomps down on you
 Yeah youre pulled into its poopy mouth
 That is  points of piercing damage and I
need you to roll a constitution saving throw as
the horribly
  points of piercing damage
 Make a constitution saving throw please
 Six no As the teeth sink into your body
and you pull away you feel this mild infection
already begin to set inside you and you are
poisoned
 The other tentacle is going to swing over
towards you Jester as it sees you around the
corner That however is a really poor roll
Thats going to be an eight that misses you You
duck and it hits the stone causing this dust to
spray off of it from the impact Thats going to
end its turn Caleb youre up
 For the purposes of that well put Yasha on
this big old dice there
 Not twice
 Six is about as close as you can get
there
 You have advantage on strength checks and
saving throws which is what your rage does but
your weapons do an additional d points of damage
when you hit which is good
 Caleb that ends your turn
 You can yeah
 Go for it As it strikes and misses Jester
you get one swing but its with disadvantage on
the attack because youre poisoned
 Swing wide unfortunately youre hazy in
your view and you feel the poison start to seep
into your veins the diseased bite of the creature
starting to infect your torso That ends Calebs
turn Nott youre up
 You other three are up after that at the
same time
 That hits Roll damage
 Yeah theyre adjacent so you get sneak
attack
 Oh damn
  points of damage
 Okay so Ill put you about there to do
that
 Five feet
 Take a swig Its a free action All right
Jester Yasha and Fjord you guys are going at
the same time so you decide who is going to take
their action first
 All right so Jester Yasha then Fjord
Jester
 What saving throw is that
 Rolled a four Three plus one
 Seven points of necrotic damage As the bell
 you watch as the creature shimmies in place
 You dont think so What do you want to do
 Jester stays Yasha what are you doing
 You dont get reach with the Enlarge so you
still have to get one more to hit with the melee
weapon
 Youre ten feet away from Beau currently
 There Youre ten feet away from Jester
yeah
 Rage kicks in
 You have any reckless attacks or not
 No thats fine
  just hits go ahead and roll damage
 Not on attacks If she does reckless she
gets advantage
  points of damage with the strike As
large Yasha 
 This is going to be a thing I have to make
a large Yasha figure now Swing the giant blade
with two hands As the blade carves down it
embeds itself four or five inches into the body of
the creature It pulls back instinctually and as
it does it drags the blade through its body and
blood sprays out The blood itself is a thick
brown color and the smell gets even worse as it
begins to spray its ichor around the air Well
done Is that your turn
 Fjord your turn
 Go for it You step out from behind cover
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Nice
 You can Dart back onto the edge
 That ends your turn Top of the round Beau
youre up
 Disadvantage on all attacks
  hits
 Concentration
 Nine points of damage as you strike it This
time the wooden sword does snap It breaks on
impact You still have the hilt
  Theres a resounding
cheer
 You go in your defensive stance Good That
ends your turn Molly youre up
 You are   feet from it
  thats your movement
 Thats a 
 He still saves
TALIESIN Thats all right
 That your turn
 Now its the creatures turn With you right
there in front of it its going to attempt to
bite you Yasha with its giant mouth
 That is  Whats your armor class
 Aw okay hits you
  does hit You take  points of piercing
damage and I need you to make a constitution
saving throw
 Just strength
 Eight Even in your enlarged state the
diseased gathering of bacteria and terrible
elements
  points The poison courses through your
body and Yasha you are considered poisoned
 It does Its going to take its tentacles
and swing one towards you Jester
 That is  to hit
 As the tentacle swings out toward you
clawing past you with its raking teeth oh shit
Thats  points of bludgeoning damage plus eight
points of piercing damage as it carves into you
 Go for it
 You are also grappled as the tentacle wraps
around you and begins to squeeze and hold you in
place The teeth and the thorns that are coming
out of the side of its tentacle jamming into your
body Is it a constitution save for Hellish
Rebuke
 There we go That is going to be a nine
 d damage to it
  points of damage Nice Theres a burst
of icy shards and blades that explode out of
Jester into the tentacle and along the side of its
body as it pulls back in place swinging its other
tentacle out behind it towards Beau
 With disadvantage because you have defense
Even with a disadvantage that is 
 You suffer five points of bludgeoning
damage plus three points of piercing so eight
total and you are also grappled
 Now you are poisoned and grappled The two
side tentacles and theres the one large tentacle
on top which now that you have a closer look has
three vertical eyes in it that are glancing around
and looking at the space The two are wrapped
around two of your allies as Yashas dealing with
the poison wracking through her veins Thats
going to end its turn Caleb youre up
 Go for it Because it attacked Beau you
could use your reaction to attack it back with
your Sentinel feat
 They both do You have that Ill let you do
it now if you wanted to if you want to take it
 You have disadvantage on the attack
unfortunately
 The first and the last one hit
  just misses You swing and as youre
about to hit with the blade the poison pulses
through your veins and you go wide as the
creature manages to be out of range How much
damage is that
 Both rays slam into it and the flames burst
up and you hear  trying to pull
back from the impact but its currently by the
wall and its holding onto your friends and
holding its ground
 That ends Calebs go Jester
 Yes You are currently grappled and while
you are grappled you are restrained until you
break free
 Oh sorry Notts after Caleb my bad Thank
you
 Ten goes wide As its reeling back from the
blow of the flame jets from your buddy Caleb
unfortunately as you fire it moves just out of the
way and the bolt goes wide
 If it landed then its fine
  does hit so go ahead and roll damage and
sneak attack
 Its still adjacent to a friend of yours
 Nice all right It strikes on the inside of
the mouth
  points of damage total got it bolt
impact groaning It looks like its hurting but
its also in control of the battlefield on that
side there That ends your turn Jester
 It looks like its hurt
 If youd like to
 Okay The saving throw thats cocked No
that is a five plus one
 Hey it all helps It all goes to the same
place You are still restrained and held in place
there Anything else you want to do
 No its an action to break free
 End of your turn
 Yasha youre up
 He said about  minutes between rounds and
a short rest is an hour
 You have not used reckless That gives you
advantage on your attacks
 Correct For now its a straight roll
theres no disadvantage on that roll
 Thatll do it That doubles your weapon and
the d You roll those together Its whatever
that is Its your d for your weapon d for
your divine ability and then your die so then
double that Roll those double that and then add
your plus seven
 Ooh no
 How do you want to do this

 Yeah you fucking murdered it
 Its currently holding Jester and Beau and
it looks like its about to slam them together
Its pulling them back and their feet are dragging
off the ground and causing grooves in the sand
and its 
 Which you can do because at your full
height youre about as tall as it is In a
downward angle you thrust forward and jam it
right into the center of its membrane above its
mouth As you push down you watch your blade
actually protrude out the roof of its mouth
through its mouth through the tongue and into
the rest of its body and as you push it gives
this horrible squealing guttural swinelike
sound and as you push and push and push it
falls onto its back and you keep pushing and you
keep pushing and the tentacles go limp and
release both Jester and Beau At that point you
pull the blade free and it is not moving on the
ground bleeding out into the sand
 Okay good to know Enlarge lasts for how
long
 Your size is reduced to a more diminutive
stance As you guys back into the inside the
poison however is still holding
 You dont know
 In your herbalism kit you can make
antitoxin if youre in a space
 Yes Its a medicine check to apply it
properly but you can do that
 Yeah As you guys back into the corner you
manage to go ahead and apply the medicinal herbs
which are used now but the poison does manage to
fade from your body Beau You are no longer
poisoned Youre using Lesser Restoration on
Yasha you said Up to you
 Okay the poison is removed which is
probably a good thing because it lasts until
cured
 Technically its a disease that causes
poison but because the nature of the herbs that
youve utilized in this space it fits in a
similar realm because its a bacterial infection
that kicks in Ill say because you got to it
quickly enough and you rolled so high you were
able to do that
 Kind of yeah
 d plus two for a healing potion As you
guys are in the process of doing this you hear
the voice shouting out not even realizing the
other group that walks outside The Mountain
Makers from Grimgolir The dwarf and gnome troupe
makes their way out into the field As the crowd
cheers the emcee vanishes and you see an opposing
side open once again Immediately bursting
through you see a large ninefoot troll with
elongated arms and legs start rushing into the
fray screaming this highpitched yelp As it
runs you can see its skin as opposed to the deep
forest green that youve read about or seen in
trolls in your experiences this looks like a dull
tealblue color You watch as the dwarves all of
a sudden rush in The gnomes begin casting
spells and this assault goes back and forth You
see with each strike this cold mist off the claws
of the troll with each blow You watch as the
gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire and you
watch as the entity burns their intelligent
knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it
from regenerating Fairly rapidly they make short
work of it They were prepared and it was not as
intense a battle as you were expecting With
that
 To your memory you didnt know that You
didnt notice anything With the final of the
battle the cheers go wild the crowd goes crazy
and eventually The Mountain Makers make their way
back into the field Anything else you guys needed
to prepare at this time
 Out from the Menagerie Coast The Stubborn
Stock
 Behind you as the doors open they move
past you Darrow goes Hey wish us luck friends
and enters into the sunlight
 The doors close Looking out past the way
another door opens off to the side and you watch
as a footlong crocodile becomes barreling into
the center its jaws opening and snapping as it
comes rushing in It climbs over the wall that the
guys are getting behind to defend and immediately
snaps down on one of the soldiers who gets hit in
the side and screams out in pain They all begin
to rush in and assault jumping off the wall and
getting onto its back You watch as Darrow climbs
up onto it taking a shortsword that one of his
friends had dropped and jams it into the top of
the head As he pulls out his battleaxe he begins
to hack away He seems to be laughing Another friend pries
the mouth off of the one soldier that had been
stamped on He limps away as it spins around its
tail slapping one of its friends sending him
flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding
into the sky It hits the dirt off the way He
runs to try and retrieve it The battle goes back
and forth for a while One of their friends goes
down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him
away from the battle zone as he begins to try and
wake him up At this point you watch as Darrow
makes a couple of motions to his friends and they
all cycle in and assault at one time cutting at
the throat of the large crocodile as Darrow takes
his axe and carves out one of its eyes As it
pulls back screaming in pain they both come
underneath and cut through the throat at the same
time causing it to bleed out With that the
crocodile collapses not moving into the field
 They slap awake their ally and they begin
to drag themselves back into the chamber as the
crowds cheering Theyre a little wounded and a
little winded but as they come in Heh That
wasnt too bad Youre on deck I suppose They
bring their friend over to the side and one
 The one that came out here The crocodile
came out here
 That was the last one
 Oh the ice troll Sorry The ice troll came
from this side there They are changing
 To the front lines again The Last Line
You see as the armored soldiers go back out there
into the field They get into the center They
form a phalanx back to back in the center as they
look around in any direction and you hear
  and two gates open From each
gate two largelooking figures come charging out
You see these sprinting dark humanoid creatures
with giant horns out of the front of their head
Two minotaurs come charging into the center
Immediately they both break into two groups and
try to head them off shields up One of them gets
thrown taking the impact of the blow Knocked
back onto his ass three feet back The other one
gets gored immediately the horns piercing his
armor and throwing him into the air As this
happens you notice now theyre both wielding
large axes and they start cleaving into the
opponents Theyre giving up a good fight and it
goes back and forth for a bit but at one point
you watch one drop and another drop A third one
gets grabbed and picked up and then broken over
the knee of one of the minotaurs At which point
you see the elven general begins to look around
nervously and starts waving his hand to call it
off just as one of them gores him from behind He
gets thrown ten feet landing onto the ground
rolling unconscious His blade clattering in the
dirt There you see Gunther in the center with two
warhammers in his hands blood down his face
going Come on They both come charging in at
him from two different sides Last minute he
darts backward causing them to collide into each
other As theyre stunned he rushes up and jams
his hammer into the head of one of them Once
Twice One of the minotaurs goes down and right
as he pulls back the second minotaur gets him
from behind You watch as a horn pierce where his
liver is and he falls unconscious on the ground
They fall The final minotaur roars up into the
air and the whole crowd goes Oh You watch as
two groups come out with chains and manacles and
manage to grapple and throw them down The lasting
minotaur passes out in the chains and they drag
him back off the field The two clerics rush out
into the field and prevent death to those who are
in the process of slipping With that The Last
Line is pulled back the first fallen out here in
the field
 The first fallen in the tournament
 Let us greet back to the field The Mighty

piercing damage as it bites down on you with its
giant jaws I need you to make a strength saving
throw which you do not have advantage currently
because youre not raging
 Success it does not knock you prone It
bites and tries to throw you onto the ground but
you push off of its jaws and use the back of the
wall to steel yourself and kick its mouth off of
you and still stand there resolute with your
blade in hand The other one is going to attempt
to break free It does not like being held in
place by there What does it have to roll to break free
  What kind of check
 Strength  plus four thats  yeah It
manages to break free of the hand
 Thats its action correct It will move
over here to flank up right there Beau you do
get an attack of opportunity as it moves out of
the space and if you hit it it does prevent it
from moving
  hits

 It gets dragged back It does not get into
melee with the rest of your friends as you grab
that tail and then pull it back
 As youre pulling the tail its screaming
 Thats going to end their turn Yasha
youre up
 Yeah
 Go for it
 Good thing you went reckless
 Jesus I think you found your snitch
  points
 No how do you want to do this

 Technically its not plus two with rage
because its not plus seven right Because you
werent raging
 Its 
 Because youre not raging remember There
is two damage from that you dont have on the plus
seven so its plus five
 Still enough to finish it but I wanted to
let you know
 Its plus three for strength plus two for
your Divine Fury and then plus two for your rage
damage that makes it plus seven but youre not
raging
 It had  hitpoints left so you still
manage to carve it down

 As the blade carves through you hear it
yelp and its growl turns into this low guttural
 and goes limp in your grip as you
push it and draw the blade from its body It
slumps onto the ground right at the base of
Jester Molly you both take a step back as the
body slumps to the ground no longer moving Hex
is off
 Thats the end of Yashas turn Nott youre
up
 That hits
  points of damage to it all right
 Go for it
 Ten to attack you mean
  It goes too wide It
hits the stone behind almost hitting Beau Youre
like  as it sparks off the
stone No impact
 There you go Nott the Brave by the name
Fjord youre up
 Oh youre going in melee with it
 All right so you move there
 As the blade appears in the hand you see a
blast of greenish energy as the blade apparates
out of his grip As he swings upward it sends an
arc of seawater splashing into the air Go ahead
and roll for an attack
 That definitely hits
 Same sword looks a little different
  points of damage to it
 As you arc upward it cuts upward the
splash of seawater mixed with the arc of blood
from the wound The way you carved up hits the
back of its thigh and one leg collapses for a
second and it looks over at you with these angry
piercing blue eyes Its looking pretty hurt Its
limping to that side now You guys see that the
falchion has a slight curve to it and has a hooked
end to the back of its design That finishes your
turn Fjord Caleb youre up
 That hits go and roll for damage
 Total of nine fire damage to it As its
turning back and forth and growling and Beaus
harrying it from the side the two rays of fire
slam into its side and it turns back around You
can see the dark burn marks on its white fur where
the impacts have started to burn and you can see
some of the skin underneath where the hair has
been burned away is black and cracked Its hurt
pretty bad
 Perfect Ending Calebs turn Beau youre
up
 Go for it
  does hit
 Eight points of damage
 As you slam it with the second hit up in its
groin area its impacted Its hanging on Its
hurting but its pretty beat up
 Yasha and Beau have been hitting two sides
of coin tonight All right
 I know how many ki points do you have
left
 Thats the last one All right
 Well that ends Beaus turn Jester youre
up and Molly youre after that
 All righty
 Okay Runs around It rolled a  whats
your DC
 Resists it unfortunately
 Sorry
 Anything else on your turn
 Okay Molly youre up
 Thatll hit
 No it does not
 Seven points all righty
 Yep roll damage
 How do you want to do this

 As you go rushing towards it it opens its
jaws to strike You slide down and with one
scimitar you jam up into its lower jaw which
causes its upper jaw to be stuck and as you pull
it out its jaw falls open As it does your other
blade you backswing dropping not dropping but
holding on with both hands on the other side
swing through and as it carves in you actually
get about one to two feet inward as the jaw lolls
open The tongue slips out as you cut it from the
inside of the mouth Its eyes go dull as the
creatures body collapses to the ground no longer moving
 With that point the whole crowd goes
cheering
 The gates where you came open and you all
go and return
 Okay as you guys step into the back
chamber you cast Prayer of Healing
 All righty
 All righty
 As you guys pull back into your chamber
theres a few nods Darrows clapping and the rest
of his team are clapping Theres a clap from two
of the Mountain Makers off to the side At which
point The Mountain Makers are announced and
they step out into the space As they all gather
hiding in the corner spreading out a bit two of
the sides open Out of one two large furred
entities about eight to nine feet tall come
rushing in with a combination of fur and feathers
these hooked dark beaks at the tips of their
mouths Two owlbears come running in and go into
an assault on these people They took some hits in
the last battle and as it goes back and forth
you watch as theyre striking it and cutting
through The owlbears are screaming this horrible
squeal of pain and anguish combined with ravenous
anger and they start tearing and pulling into
them One of them grabs the gnome in its beak
pulls up and tears its throat out The gnome
gurgles as it falls to the ground The two clerics
immediately come up to the side getting ready to
rush out there to try and save its life Another
one of them manages to hit one of the owlbears in
its leg as it falls on the ground and they all
start slashing on it It looks like one owlbear is
about to fall as the other one in a complete
frenzy either partnered or what tears and grabs
one of the dwarves and starts biting into its face
as it screams it falls unconscious on the ground
It grabs another and bites into its chest
throwing it into the sky as they spin off to the
side As they all begin to pick up to assault the
one thats going after them the one on the ground
slowly gets back up and joins the fray You watch
one by one as these owlbears on the cusp of
dying tear through the Mountain Makers
At which point the crowd goes like  Whoa
Big cheers Cheers because its a display but
also that mournful Whoa that low bassy sound
At which point you see the two groups come out
again with the chains and the come up to the
outskirts of the owlbears which then pass out and
they put the manacles on and then pull them away
 Right as they get up to them they pass out
They pull them off and drag them the gates open
wipe the clerics rush out and grab and drag in
the bodies The gnome is gone but one of the
clerics reaches over and touches him and for a
moment later  breath comes back and you
watch the wound close up somewhat Brought from
death As they pull the group in
 The shout comes for the next group The
Stubborn Stock returns and Darrow and his team
rush out giving a pat on the shoulder to Yasha on
the rush out They go out to the middle field the
gates close and there two of the gates open on
the sides and you see these dark shapes kind of

 Almost skittering but shifting their
position seems hard to map At which point you see
Darrow glance on the side and he goes Oh no I
know what this is You watch as these large
pantherlike creatures with large tendrils off
their back whipping begin rushing inward
 One of them swings and strikes but as he
strikes it passes through and it all of a sudden
shifts and was not in the space where it blow and
it pounces onto one of his adventurers They begin
to hack back and forth crowding up around each
other back to back one of them is pulling out his
longbow and letting loose arrow after arrow Some
striking some missing One of them all of a
sudden the phase is lost it gets struck and now
it is in a solid place They use that moment for
all of them to dash in and surround this one
creature They manage to within one round carve
down this one displacer beast on one side the
other pouncing onto Darrow and holding him to the
ground Its back legs clawing into his belly as
the others try and pull it off Darrow takes a
serious series of wounds before he manages to pull
himself free The displacer beast grabs another of
its friends and snaps him in his face He falls
unconscious and whips around They strike at it a
few times but they cant seem to find where its
body is It is dodging around until finally Darrow
is back up his face covered in blood takes his
battle axe and swings wide and clocks it in the
side of the jaw Its strange illusion form
vanishes at that point its body coming to a very
condensed location They all swarm this one and
one by one tear it down for the next round
Theyre hurt their bruised and Darrows looking
rough but with that the Stubborn Stock raise
their hands The Stubborn Stock continues and
the crowd cheers
 As they pull back in the MC walks back out
Two rounds completed and only two teams remain
for the third and final round will they all fall
Will they all survive We shall see as next we
call forth The Mighty Nein Any preparation you
guys have in this moment as the doors begin to open

 As the quiet has this stillness thats come
across the whole battlefield every breath is
being held You all in your chaos running around
and trying to shout orders to each other you all
eventually come to settle in this place slow
heavy footfalls roaring All the doors come
upward Heavy repeated footfalls hit before
bursting out of the far end you see a Hill Giant
come barreling through

 Knocking that pillar down as it stands
there in the center of the field you see now its
 It has these tiny little spines stuck into
it like its been agitated and pushed to a point
of absolute rage and anger Its just roaring
 All right you release it

 Welcome back Oh my god Welcome back Last
names making some new friendships in the city and
taking some time for themselves in preparation for
the coming Harvest Close festival found
themselves wandering through the streets of
celebration They partook in a number of various
games of chance and skill got some fine snacks
and foods challenged themselves got thrown by
their other party members won some trinkets and
toys and then ended up signing up to the Victory
Pit the grand tournament that ends the Harvest
Close festival You managed to catch a few phrases
off to the side of the initial lounge you were
signing up in where you discovered that war had
been declared by the king on the eastern region of
Xhorhas that information was to be held back
until the festival was over You were held below
with the other competing teams and then one by
one you were each presented into the center of the
Victory Pit tournament where each of you has to
battle a challenge of a creature or creatures in a
threetiered structure Whoever survives all three
bouts gets to share in the final pot prize
Currently two of the other teams have been knocked
out and it only remains to be you and one other
You guys are up first Youre pulled into the
center and announced as The Mighty Neins final
round Knowing the Stubborn Stock is watching from
behind the distant doorways that lead into the
central arena you all scattered about the sands
as the sun begins to get close to dusk shouting
out your various plans and then abandoning them
last minute You found places as these heaping
heavy thuds start quaking the ground in arrival
before the door swings open Out from behind it
roaring a frenzied angry hill giant complete
with pierced thorns jammed into each side of the
body to drive it to a point of absolute anger and
fury comes bashing into the center of the arena
knocks over one of the large pillars and this is
where we begin I need everyone to roll initiative
  to 
  to 
  to ten
 All righty friends It finishes slamming
the large pillar into the ground and wields its
giant club over one shoulder its other hand
reaching out for something and glancing over the
field to see what its quarry is Nott youre up
first
 Right now Fjord youre hiding back there
I think I shifted it
 No he is not currently engaged
 By the way guys this finally came in
today
 So you know where the north is so you can
use that
 This way
 The people who do Campaign Coins make that
now Our friend Deven Rue who did our map for
the show shes the one who designed it Ive been
waiting for it to come in Thats a point for you
guys if you ever want to shout directions at me
of where you want to run thats helpful
 You ran full sprint towards Jester
 It arcs off you hear this distant  in
the audience way away
 Yeah no
 Yeah its a pretty hardy physicality even
if its a broad target to hit
 Same place you were before
 This is north here
 Caleb youre up
 Youre darting around the side
  just hits
 Its a big target but its pretty hardy
 One point of fire damage It hits and goes
 Its less of a Fire Bolt and more of a
fire  You see theres a patch on its
rather furry belly that no longer has hair Its
very glaring
 Okay good to know Jester youre up
 Then use it
 Where would you like to place it
   is where you can make it
appear
 Let me see what the range is on it Whats
the range on the spell
  Yeah you can do it right over
 Roll for attack go for it As Jester
releases her grip this giant heavylooking but
gorgeous glittering lollipop apparates out of the
air streaking down towards the goblins face Not
the goblin the ogres giants face Its been a
week
  hits roll damage
 Yes you can
 He rolled a  but has minus one dex
 Wunderbar That finishes your turn
Jester
 You got it
 Now its the giants turn After being
slammed in the face with this lollipop and the
flames is like  Ducks out of the
way as it slams down on its head grabs the side
of the pillar which breaks The pillar as it
fell over shattered into four or five pieces
grabs and picks up a single piece The only one
that it paid attention to right now is the one
that lit its stomach on fire It takes this thing
and lobs it in your direction
 You do have cover Its threequarters
cover Whats your armor class currently
 That adds plus five to your AC so its 
on this attack Thats still a  to hit though
so it still hits you  plus eight sorry
 As this chunk of the pillar goes flying
across the arena towards you it hits the top of
the wall which breaks and a good foot and a half
section of it shatters as it slams into your chest
 You can
 All right There you go As you see it slam
into the wall above you and go swinging you throw
up the shield and all of a sudden theres a spark
of arcane energy as it gets deflected inches off
of the top of Calebs head before slamming into
the side of the actual tournament arena hitting
the stone causing it to crack and people in the
front area 
 You were  because you had threequarters
cover because you were behind the wall You had
 plus five because you were behind
 At this moment the absolute fear kicks into
his eyes The entity is going to charge forward
Right at that point it stops and turns and sees
out of the corner of its eye Fjord hiding behind
the wall Thats going to be its turn Molly
youre up
 Okay to there Is it for flanking bonus
 Go for it
 Weve used it occasionally but it works
against you guys as well If you manage to get
directly across from a creature with an ally in
melee you get advantage on the attack
 You were ranged last campaign so it didnt
come into play very often
 That hits
 No hes not undead
 Eight points of damage for the first
strike
 The first strike you carve up alongside its
blubbery thick belly thats flipping over this
piece of cloth that it has matted around its
midsection As you cut through it buckles a
little bit on that one side of the leg and you use
that moment to cut behind its thigh right down
below where the Achilles tendon is As you cut
across blood spatters across the sand and 
 Thats your turn
 Hes going to use a legendary action
 Hes a frenzied solo yeah
 Hes going to go ahead and use his Furious
Smash
 Hes going to attack yeah for slashing
him
 Okay so he has disadvantage on the attack
 Thats still a  plus eight
 As you slam and slice into the back of the
leg he angrily turns back and swings down towards
you and his eyes go black Theres a brief shake
its still a massive club and you try to move out
of the way but its too fast slamming onto you
knocking you onto the ground Your wind is knocked
out of you and your whole world goes dazed and
white for a moment This is going to be  points
of bludgeoning damage
 That was a really good damage roll It
reactively slams into Molly with the club As the
dust settles Molly is not moving on the ground
probably pushed about an inch or two into the dirt
and sand Theres a crater where the head of the
club had impacted and Molly is not moving
 Beau your turn
 Youre going to throw a throwing star Okay
go ahead
 Its d times two plus your bonus
 Okay ten damage
 No because unarmed attack its for the
outside yeah
 You throw one of these spindly jagged star
darts on the side You throw it through the air
and it sinks into its stomach You dont even see
where it impacted except for a small red line
where its beginning to bleed from where it carved
into its belly
 Youre going to stay there
 That finishes Beaus turn Fjord youre
up
 Legendary actions are different from
reactions
 That hits As the large falchion appears
curved and jagged you see this splash of seawater across
the side of the giant as its eyes are now set back
on Fjord At this point the curse sets in the
blood spatters on the ground begin to come up into
these black forms and adhere to his legs
  nice
  will get you there and he gets an attack of
opportunity against you As you strike it in the side
and you go to run you get a fair distance but the
reach with that club is just far enough where it
doesnt necessarily need it As you go charging
forward he has disadvantage because of that
That makes it a 
 You hear the  from behind as it
slams into the ground The earth leaves your foot
for a second and you land again You make your way
to the edge Well done that ends your turn That
brings us to Yasha
 You can get there
 Reckless Go for it
  hits
 Double ones
 As you go rushing by you werent paying
attention for the last impact and you see out of
the corner your eye Molly in the ground jammed
in and unconscious bleeding out and thats just
enough being not in an enraged state to
viscerally affect you and shakes you just enough
for you to swing the blade It hits the leg but
it wasnt enough actual impact to carve into the flesh
 That ends your turn Yasha Nott youre
up
 That hits You can roll damage
 He is adjacent to Yasha so it is sneak
attack damage
 Hey it adds up guys Its cool As you duck
around the corner you release the bolt It sinks
into the chest area and looks around in the direction
trying to find you You still have  feet of
movement
 Its not a rogue thing unfortunately
 The first one hit and he starts growling
and looks right in your direction You go
 fire a second one that goes right into
one of its eyes and starts roaring It gets caught
right up inside It doesnt quite pierce the
eyeball but it gets up into the socket
 Its scratching at its face angrily
 Right there
 Okay Thats your turn Nott
 Caleb youre up
 That does not hit unfortunately It just
misses As you see once again Molly on the ground
and Yasha barely making an impact Nott gets a
couple good hits off and you try to fire
Unfortunately as he pulls back to grasp the face
the Fire Bolt goes wide past where the head
previously was
 There
 That would put you about there That ends
your turn Caleb
 Jester youre up
 Okay As the hand is grasping at where it
got shot in the eye it goes right for the back of
the elbow
  points of damage
 As it hits   Hes
shaking the hand as its going numb The one eye
is half shut Going 
 You mean your action Because you already
used your bonus action
 Wisdom of  Natural  sorry
 That ends your turn Its now the giants
turn As Yasha has just torn into the side its
going to turn back to you and is going to double
club attack you
 It has advantage on each
 Because she did Reckless
 The first one is a 
 Natural  okay
 The first hit is
  points of damage bludgeoning damage
from the first hit  You put your hands up
and you put the blade up to catch it it slams
into it and pulls the shoulder out of the socket
and pushes you down into the dirt As you push
off the club goes up once more and then 
 I rolled an eight seven and a five
Thats
 Thats  points of damage
 
 You have to go negative your max score
 With the second slam Yasha partially
deflects the first impact and then vanishes in the
second one Right there next to Molly as the dust
clears you see Yasha unmoving her legs up in
the air as the rest of her torso is pushed down
into the dirt and the rest of the ground is
covered over where you can see the back of her
shoulders and the back of her head and the rest
of it is dust settling Shes not moving either
 I think at this point yeah because youre
the one who shot it twice in the eye and it saw
you duck behind 
 You watch as it steps over the wall Tiny
thing After it smashes Yasha it doesnt even
care anymore and theres a little bit of foam at
the corner of the mouth The bloods trailing down
its face from where the bolt entered Thats going
to end the giants turn Molly youre up Molly
Molly
 Molly make a death saving throw
 Oh thats right
 What are the effects of the locket again
 What are the effects of the locket again
 Yeah So you stabilize Youre still
unconscious
 But youre not bleeding out
 There you go
 Beau your turn
 Yeah Hes ready to smash the little
goblin
 Over there Flanking would be on the
opposite side
 Right here
 Okay so your bonus action is to say Tiny
thing
 Your bonus action is to say Tiny thing
towards his dick
 Go ahead and make an intimidation check
 Yes that is exactly what youre doing
 He seems to think youre agreeing with him
with regards to Nott I know Tiny thing
 No Thats your turn Fjord youre up
Youre in the middle of the field and you see both
Yasha and Molly crushed into the ground This
little lollipop is  in the air
behind
 All right You move into the space here
 You can see him over the wall
 Thatll hit Go ahead and roll damage
 Nice Thats a good hit  Off the
side of the shoulder You can watch where the
section where the skin used to be is now exposed
muscle Where its burned off the outer layer of
the body
 Sure
 With the additional Hex damage right
 That was with the additional damage from
the
 That ends Fjords turn Yasha I need you to
make a death saving throw
 Nope
 Thats a fail You failed your first death
saving throw
 At the end of Yashas turn the giant is
going to use his legendary action He has one
legendary action Trying to do a club attack
against you Nott
 Once every round
 Thats a  Whats your armor class
  points of bludgeoning damage
 As it slams down it hits you and pushes
you into the wall Youre flattened against the
stone which quakes On the opposite side of it it
cracks and  off the back You
hear this squeak sound as Nott is crushed between
the club and the wall
 Its your turn
 Yes
 He looks very confused in the middle of his
foaming frenzy
 Jester
 Oh shit  Whats the save on that
 But what is it Is it wisdom
 That is a natural  minus one 
 Im rolling really well Im so sorry
guys
 You can get there
 If you wanted to go around that way you
could
 Well say yeah Thatll put you right there
Okay that ends your turn Caleb youre up
 Go ahead and roll your d
 Go for it and tell me what the total is
  You watch as the large giant 

 Steps back and hits the pillar behind him
It cracks and tilts to the side Catches him
 Falls to both knees and eventually hits
the ground This loud heavy snore
 Hes just unconscious
 You shout this out
 Youre shouting this out as this is
happening
 Theyre all waiting for a moment
 No ones called the match yet
 It is your turn yes
 Correct
 Any movement Caleb
 Jester youre up
  You cant quite get there
 You could have reached Molly yes
 Well actually if you were here you could
have gotten to there
 You can move it  feet there
 Well the range is  feet but as a bonus
action it moves 
 Next the giants turn It stays unconscious
for the duration until something hits it Yeah so
its a minute
 Potentially guys here figure out what
your plan is until someone touches it
 No he doesnt He stabilizes
 Moving which one
 Okay
 Okay
 It doesnt matter who rolls it really
 Well healing potion isnt hit dice Hit
dice is only when youre taking a short rest
 Behind where
 Where like over here
 Anybody else
 Okay so youre going here and Yashas
going here is that what youre doing
 Well you cant both go for the head if
youre flanking Either you can both get by the
head
 Oh I see
 Thats okay All right
 Within  feet you would be there
 Whos taking the first shot
 Whos attacking first
 Go for a roll Its a melee attack you have
advantage because hes unconscious
 Okay Its an autocrit because hes
unconscious
 Its with your staff
 Aw Two damage plus
 As you slam down it hits right off the
ocular socket and skids off the skull 
the eye shoots open the other one still swollen
from the shot earlier opens as well 
 You still get advantage because hes prone
 Poof right in the eye  The eye
closes instinctually and the arms begin to flail
as its trying to
 No because thats the end of Beaus turn
now its Fjords turn
 At the end of Beaus turn its going to go
ahead and use its recovered legendary action to
 Its been a number of rounds
 You didnt declare it
 Okay well from now on if youre going to
hold your action please specify that Those who
were nearby needed to hold an action that would
be you Molly
 No because if you guys were holding your
action to the trigger of you attacking then
theyre all going before you do that
 Cool Take your turns
 Thats a   minus one yeah
 I know Ive been rolling really fucking
well tonight Im sorry
 Its also a DC  but yeah All right
 You have disadvantage because hes prone
 Okay Still hits
  points of damage How do you want to do
this

 As it begins to thrash about its one hand
hits the ground kicking up all this dust and
sand The other club comes back using it to get
up off its feet it looks like its ready to swing
out towards Yasha and Beau whos just finished
slamming into the creature At that moment you
see the exposed belly that already has gashes in
it from the wound and you wait and release right
for the opening As it sinks in it stands up
anyway and you watch as blood begins to pour out
You hit something major and its starting to
bleed out and it
 Takes a swing and at this point theres
already blood draining out and the swing goes
wide hits the ground falls back onto its butt
and proceeds to slowly go back to sleep forever
 At which point theres a pause this awkward
quiet before the entire audience at once goes

 The cheers continue as the large goliath
steps out again with his tattoos and spiked armor
and he goes There we have it the third round
completion of The Mighty Nein But one more fight
stands Congratulations You guys are then led
over to the holding area off to the side as you
pass your friends of the Stubborn Stock
 Leaving this large groove in the sand behind
you As you guys walk by the team begins to
theres this slow motion like opposing little
league baseball teams passing each other
 You see Darrow who gives this Not too
bad well played Gives a smile as he continues
past You see the dwarven crossbow ranger gives a
grin with his big scruffy poof beard Theres the
halfelf woman with two warhammers that shes
spinning on the leather straps on the end You see
this really fucking old guy This wrinkly old
prospectorlooking eyes through these wrinkled
slits 
 I have no other way to describe him
 His hairs long past his shoulders but its
super bald skullet on top You see theres a
tattooed halfling whos got his chin in the air
grin and give you a show and theres the human
archer that has a longbow thats at the ready All
of them walk by all six of them into the center
of the arena
 Make a sleight of hand check
  He does not notice Its not a
shoelace unfortunately Theres a boot lace You
untie it You dont know how much of an effect it
will have
 As you guys make your way into the holding
area the doors close once more As the goliath
Jermai Kull shouts out For the final match of
the tournament and the final round the Stubborn
Stock The audience big shouts screams hands in
the air then silence  The gates
on the side open as they all circle around and
look ready not able to really ascertain the
direction All the gates open and then barreling
through at the far side you see a large foot
dragonoid creature with a long snout wings that
have been carved and cut to where it cannot fly
and its lumbering forward without its flight No
arms just the wings giant clawed legs and a
long tail with a large poison stinger at the end
This is a wyvern A wyvern thats been prevented
flight and comes barreling straight to the
center They immediately go into a formation to
accept the creature as it goes Darrow rushes up
with his battleaxe and starts cutting into the
creature You see this divine energy flicker off
the arc as it slams into the side of this this
flash of radiant energy off of his battleaxe He
pulls away his long black ponytail swishing
behind from the arc of the blow As he ducks out
of the way the tail swings and he ducks
underneath it The archer pulls back an arrow and
the arrow flashes bright bluegreen energy before
it strikes and bursts into arcane energy on the
side of this wyvern It turns around and grabs the
dwarf by the head and begins to thrash around with
him in its jaws throwing him about ten feet he
skids to the ground falls unconscious in the
first round
 The old armored guy pulls up a symbol from
his chest and begins to chant in the wrong
direction before the halfling grabs him and spins
him this way and he goes Right ha and
continues his chants Another weapon a Spiritual
Weapon appears and apparates but it looks like a
large club of stone that begins to slam The
wyvern spins around and its tail manages to impact
the belly of the old guy as he finishes his chant
and you watch him go limp and fall to the ground
 The halfling with the tattoos tears his
shirt down and exposes all these tattoos on his
chest and he slaps them and begins to chant in a
Hakastyle chant He begins to  As hes
doing this chant all of his allies that are
standing begin to get revved up before he rushes
in and pulls a blade and strikes at the wyvern
carving into its side
 You watch as the dwarven crossbow ranger
rushes up and brings the cleric back to health
The cleric comes to consciousness and then brings
through a quick casting of a spell off to the
side the whats the other one there it was
the
 The old guys the one that went down and
actually no the dwarf you thought was down
actually gets back up He wasnt unconscious just
knocked really hard He gets up makes sure the
cleric is up The cleric heals some people around
them and they begin to curl around it They
continue to strike and back and forth the
audience is breathless at moments The wyvern
jumps up on top of one of the walls its stinger
spins around and jams into Darrow You see Darrow
the leader takes a blow to the chest and he goes
unconscious on the ground before the wyvern
pounces on him and starts tearing into the body
 The halfling whos still continuing this
chant rushes forward leaps onto its back and
begins carving at the back of its neck The
elderly cleric begins approaching still chanting
in his mind and hes unleashing heal spells and
occasionally throwing a bolt of energy an
electrical divine bolt of energy strikes the side
of the wyvern The dwarven ranger unleashes strike
after strike of the crossbow and the wyverns
hitting whatever comes near it Two more of the
members go unconscious and it gets down to just
three on their side before they manage to
continue to stab into its side Like a
longrunning bull fighting ring both sides are
exhausted at this point Three of the six are down
and the wyverns still standing Darrow has gotten
back up and is breathing hard He backs around the
side and theyve all surrounded the wyvern whos
feeling cornered at this point blood pouring from
different wounds on its body It gives another
loud shriek It turns around towards the elderly
cleric and charges him and with a giant sweep of
its jaw sends him about ten  feet in the air
before he lands and rolls unconscious on the
ground
 Theres two left The boot does dislodge and
arc an additional ten feet before resting away
from
 With that the two standing members which
are Darrow and the halfling both charge in The
halfling gives a pat on Darrows shoulder and
shouts out a phrase in a language you dont
understand Darrow seems to embolden his muscles
rushes in for a strike and carves down with his
battleaxe into the back of the neck after it
slammed into the cleric As the blade sinks in
about five or six inches the large battle cry
that it gave shrinks back into this weird
withering screech As it whips around Darrow
pulls his battleaxe out and backs away a few
steps The wyvern falls to its knees and with that
Darrow spins the battleaxe in his hands and carves
off the rest of its head with two three four
strikes before it collapses With that

  The cheers are deafening at this
point The gates open in front of you as the emcee
walks out once more and goes An incredible fight
by the Stubborn Stock Bring out our other
winners The Mighty Nein The audience goes into
loud cheers You guys step out into the arena The
same crews coming out and dragging the body of
the wyvern off down into the depths of where it
was originally unleashed and the doors close
behind The clerics rush out and bring to
consciousness the other members of the Stubborn
Stock They all eventually rise beaten and
bruised and as winded as a lot of you look They
give you a look as you approach and its a well
done smile Wordless but a nod of respect Then
you to the right side of Jermai Kull them to the
left Raise your arms For today on this Harvest
Close you are the victors The crowd goes crazy
once more flowers and bits of rice grain and all
sorts of things are thrown into the center of the
ring in part of the celebration
 There are copper flung from the audience
from the row You guys take that moment While
its frustrating to share it maybe you made it
One of the gates on the opposite side opens up and
a group of seven individuals begin to approach in
various robes You recognize a lot of them as
people that were in the lounge earlier before you
entered this actual arena Theyre carrying a
small chest of iron and dark set wood and as they
place it on the ground they begin to pull out
sacks of money Theyre presenting you the divided
prize Thats three rounds for the group and each
round was  gold Thats  gold that you guys
get to divide and then the final pot was 
divided amongst the two teams An additional 
to your team So  gold
 As the moneys delivered to you you acquire
your reward Theres a final burst of cheers from
the audience and youre escorted back into the
holding area where the other groups have already
left They close the doors behind and it seems
like the fanfares over the attention on you
momentarily has faded and its just you guys the
clerics and the other group the Stubborn Stock
 Last you saw they were up in the stands
 You guys just got back to the holding area
taking a breath for yourself
 Darrow goes Thats a really good question
Clerics The clerics say Weve used most of
them but I can offer a couple They come up and
they give you a heal You heal eight hit points
 Yasha you get one and then thats a ten
You heal ten Then two other spells are delivered
to the opposing side The other team
 I appreciate that I say the same to your
team That was no small feat I mean literally
It was very large feet on that gentleman
 As I heard that from across the way
 Thats okay
 Apparently giants do not suffer the same
insecurities that most people in this town does
 Oh there is but in the lounge area
Come
 Well the winners of course
 Most likely
 Come on
 The dwarf behind you goes Oh aye I could
go with that one too  Hes holding his
back The halfelf who had the two warhammers
goes Oh dont worry honey Scruffs his hair
He goes Stop it He puts his arm around her
waist and the two walk off together
 Youre led back to the lounge where you had
originally signed up for this also the same place
where you had overheard the conversation with
Starosta As you enter now its still that
lowlit interior with the fine furniture
cushions The food spread has been refilled The
drinks are poured The servants are going around
with their trays to make sure that everyone has
opportunity to eat and drink as you go Inside
however it is a little busier than the last time
you recall The Starosta Wyatt is there as well
currently entertaining a few guests in there
Theres a couple of welldressed merchants that
look like theyre dressed in the same way that
many of travelers from the Menagerie Coast are
Theres one of them who looks like theyre wearing
clothing thats a little more exotic than youre
familiar with You do also see within this area
lets see here You see Lawmaster Orentha
Stonegrasp there with her gray curled hair the
older dwarven Lawmaster of Zadash
 Briefly yeah You had one encounter with
Alongside her is Dolan Thrym and two other people
you havent met
 Oh the what what
 Oh They both appear to be wearing similar
dull gold robes as to what youve seen members of
the Kings Hall wear But theyre a little more
casual Theyre not quite as presentory or
intheoffice mode
 Well theres two people dressed in merchant
garb that you see the colors and the silks and
the billowing pants and the jewellery is very
reminiscent of Menagerie Coast where it has a lot
of finger chains that attach to rings and its
this very presentory jewelry that isnt classic
European in visual aesthetic Youve seen it
around in town where you grew up so you gather
these people are from Menagerie Coast folk The
one who looks very exotic has very light linen
outfit that is a dull eggshell white but then
has trim that is gold and purple The pants are a
deep blue Short black hair dark skin bright
smile but you dont notice any other cultural
touchstones that you have any previous experience
with
 You may have seen things similar to it
passing through your town from a distance or from
your moms place of business but nothing that you
would necessarily know Roll a history check
actually
 Actually You get the sense that this is
probably Marquesian Hes probably travelled from
Marquet which is a long way away Very rare that
you find people coming all the way from Marquet to
the Empire especially Menagerie Coast a little
more often but this is something different As you
approach and enter the Stubborn Stock immediately
scatter to the food and drink Starosta Wyatt who
you had seen briefly but not actually engaged with
before stands up as tall as a halfling can as you
approach with his curly matted hair and the
shocks of white and gray on the sides His arms
open and he goes Congratulations I just had to
come and tell you personally a fantastic display
Come closer please I want to meet all of you
He starts putting hands out to meet you Whats
your name
 Yasha Pleasure to meet you Fantastic
performance Youre a mighty warrior Im really
impressed
 Oh You are
 Molly Charmed Good pleasure to meet
you
 Fantastic You miss
 Thats a curious name
 Pleasure to meet you as well Pants are
rather fancy well done You there little missy
 Pam Pleasure Shy Thats okay thats
allowed Whats your name
 Caleb Pleasure pleasure to meet you You
are
 Beau Well pleasure to meet you as well
And you sir
 Oh well I will tell you a brilliant
display of skill and precisely the kind of
showmanship the fine people of Zadash need right
now I appreciate your being a part of this Its
wellearned victory and
 Yes He was the one who was being notified
This is the Starosta of Zadash
 The incident
 Oh right Well weve taken care of that
for the time being Repairs have been made the
towers back where it was The individuals you
probably want to talk to about that are over there
in the corner They were faced away from you when
you first entered but looking out from the far
window that leads to the outside you see two
figures faced away looking outward holding
glasses of wine It looks to be the two figures
you saw when you first entered the ring Oremid
Hass the headmaster of the Zauber Spire Or the
Halls of Erudition
 The dude in the white robes
 Yes They were just facing away from you
guys Wyatt Fedar says If you want to enquire
the specifics theyd be the ones to talk to I
will say Ive recently been notified by
Stonegrasp He points over to the Lawmaster
whos in conversation on the side with her own
people That you had already completed some
dangerous contract work for the city is that
correct
 Thats fantastic
 Thats the one she mentioned That thing
had been a problem for some time I hear so its
greatly appreciated Youve done twice now a
great service for this city Well this evening is
yours to celebrate Things shifting as they are
we may have need of upstanding and skilled
citizens of the Empire such as yourselves in the
near future Should you be interested that is
 I appreciate that My position here comes
with a number of responsibilities so at any given
point in time Im probably am very visibly
stretched but Im doing the best I can I
appreciate that Where might we contact you
should we be so interested
 Leaky Tap Tavern okay
 All right Well good to know Should we
have need of you well know where to come and
find you
 Oh well thats not a worry I dont think
Simon Hits the side of the chair and one of the
crownsguard comes up but a more decorated
crownsguard Looks like he holds more status and
he goes Yes Starosta He looks about and says
Can we ensure that the rest of your body of
soldiers understand that these fine champions of
this years Harvest Close festival are allowed
entry and exit from our fine TriSpires Hes
like Yes sir We will make sure that the
Crownsguard are aware of The Mighty Nein and their
ability to pass in and out unimpeded
 Oh Im Jeremiah Captain Jeremiah Im
anyway Well done well fought He takes a step
back out of the conversation and you get the sense
that theres a little bit of a hierarchy there
where the Starosta not meaning to but theres a
very much I should not be part of this
conversation and he steps out of it Well Very
well Look enjoy your wellearned evening of
revelry as much as you can I have a sense there
are some stressful days ahead so enjoy it Rest
well Takes his glass and drinks to you
 Indeed young girl He turns around and
sits up on the couch and reengages in
conversation with one of his various guests
 Its past dusk now At this point nine
oclock in the evening
 It has been
 Wait so whos going where
 Beau and Yasha are going there
 Okay It seems that the cluster of merchants
that he had originally mentioned are keeping
pretty close to the Starosta Theyre probably in
the business of discussing future transactions and
business You gather probably more on the Starosta
making connections in preparation for whats about
to transpire
 Theres about  or so people in the
chamber The chambers maybe about  feet by 
feet Its fairly packed
 You find a chair everyone seems to be
standing and conversing
 Theyre both faced away and theyre looking
out Theres a window thats open that leads out
into the main Victory Pit and then theres the
sky which is mostly clouds occasionally you see
a break with some stars Theyre in the middle of
a conversation but its hushed
 They both immediately stop and turn over to
look at you
 Pardon me can we help you You glance
over and you can see Oremid Hass at first
body like Wolverine proportions Very dark ruddy
brown skin with eyes that are black like obsidian
that sparkle when you look at them The hair is
very short and curled and theres this very
strongly inset dimple wrinkle when he smiles with
teeth that are dull gray in color Theres
something not quite human about him but also very
welcoming As he turns towards you theres a bit
of dust that is loosened from the edges of his
ears and it  Its a strange
phenomenon With long reddishgold robes his arms
are folded in the sleeves where you cant see
them He says I apologize weve taken time away
from the window The other gentleman turns
towards you and you can see now very close an
older gentleman probably s or so skin slightly
jaundiced or yellowed in color versus the usual
pigmentation here Bald on top but longer
graywhite hair that goes past the shoulders the
same white and gold robes He smiles but he looks
like hes not enjoying the pleasantries of the
space but then puts on a face as soon as he
notices your arrival and gives a nod I recognize
both of you You were part of this fight ordeal
The Mighty Nein correct
 Its possible I do not recall but if so
it is good to see you again Im sorry
 Beau I am Oremid Hass I am the Headmaster
of the Halls of Erudition This is my compatriot
Master Trent Ikithon
 He turns and goes It is a pleasure to meet
you I saw what you did today as well It was a
very majestic display of skills quite
 Oremid goes to raise his hand and Trent
goes Oh so you were present during the attack
outside of the Zauber Spire ja
 Well it was an unfortunate incident that
thankfully we were present both of us to take
care of it before it grew too dangerous
 That seemed to be assassins sent by the
Kryn dynasty terrible Cricks that had attempted to
steal something that should not fall into their
hands
 That is correct He gives you a look over
like hes inspecting you with a very rapid and
very detailed intake of your features and he
goes Where are you from if I might ask
 Where did you grow up
 How long have you lived here in the
Empire
 Fascinating
 Trent isnt even looking at you Hes
completely focused on Yasha
 Why did you leave
 Make a wisdom saving throw for me real
fast
 As youre talking its weird Hes staring
at you but for a moment you feel like theres an
illusion over his mouth and his fingers Theyre
still not moving but its almost like your eyes
catch something shifting unseen beneath them Its
almost like youve layered two images over each
other for a brief second Then theyre gone and
he goes Huh Well very happy to have you
fighting on our side
 Wonderful Maintain that please
 You and your friends seem to be very
helpful and a lot of help may be needed Should
you ever stray from that path It has been a
pleasure Yasha
 He reaches out and shakes your hand once
more I would like very much to talk to you some
time in the future Youre intriguing
 Youre Cobalt Soul arent you Oremid
goes Please stop this interrogation I
apologize My friend is very studious
 You have done much great work and have
aided us on many occasions
 Oremid Hass actually laughs and he goes
 Look I know that there have been
tensions in the past but complete honesty I
really appreciate what you do over there
 Anyway we must be off The evening has
grown late Isnt that correct Trent goes Yes
that is correct Its been a pleasure I look
forward to our paths crossing again
 To the front line of what
 We train a good number of war mages yes
Some of our finest will be present at Bladegarden
and beyond Should things escalate any further
Im sure a number of our circle will also join
where its necessary
 You have my word and the word of the
Assembly
 They both have a knowing look at each other
and look back to you Trent casts forward and
says We have been studying for quite some time
as is the nature of protecting our people here
yes but there are still many mysteries beyond the
boundaries Why Is there something you know that
we dont
 Very much so They have killed many of our
people The skies to the east darken and we want
to keep that darkness from spreading We wish the
sun to continue to rise on this empire and
currently it does not over the Ashkeeper Peaks
 Thank you If youre ever near Rexxentrum
find me I would like to continue this
conversation
 Oremid Hass speaks up and goes All right
Well anyway a wonderful night to you all Rest
well Congratulations and well fought
 Trent Ikithon IKITHON
 Youre welcome
 Rexxentrum yeah
 They exit and you watch as Oremid halfway
through the room as he has his arms folded goes
Oh my goodness Look at you and gets down and
starts going towards Frumpkin and is like Well
how did you get in here
 He begins reaching for
 No Oremid Hass immediately goes down and
goes from this completely wellestablished
presentary persona to this childlike wonder of
this cat Hes like Come here
Please I would like to touch on you
 Yep
 Okay You pull out of it and you watch as
Oremid actually picks up Frumpkin and holds him in
his hand and starts petting him like  They
both continue to walk towards the exit
 Okay As they exit the chamber Oremid
outside goes ahead and sets Frumpkin down and
pets his head for a moment Go on Dont get
stuck inside They both leave and exit into the night
 The Starosta is still here yes
 Make a perception check
 Okay You overhear the gist of most of the
conversation best you can without catching too
much attention to yourself Over the next 
minutes or so you catch what amounts to them
discussing possible future difficulty in crossing
border boundaries between the empire the
Menagerie Coast and imports The necessity of
them but having to make sure they go through very
stringent processes in doing so with the promise
of coming conflict He doesnt outright say that
theyre at war yet but the Starosta is
essentially laying the groundwork for maintaining
trade lines through the Wuyun Gorge across the
Cyrios Mountains Wanting to make sure that the
port towns of the Menagerie Coast still have
access to get the necessary goods to the empire
not only to maintain their people but to get them
as quickly as possible to the front to the east
 Yeah theyre trying to basically
establish what initially seemed like it may have
been a pleasantry based arrival on their part
they have been pulled into this conversation with
the Starosta out of necessity from his standpoint
You can sense theres a bit of desperation in his
voice Hes generally trying to do the best job he
can and feels overwhelmed in the moment and is
trying as best he can to cover it
 Frumpkin is maybe  feet outside the door
and is waiting for you guys to exit
 Okay
 As you guys are in the process of finishing
this up and people are starting to leave from the
lounge area and theyre starting to close down
Darrow comes up with his troupe theyre a ways
into their cups and hes like Friends before
we shove off and probably never meet again I just
wanted to say its been an absolute pleasure to
get to meet you to watch you fight for you to
watch us fight All the luck in your future
endeavors
 Well as far as I know were probably
heading back up to Nogvurot and continuing with
our contract of sitting around and being paid for
nothing
 Northeastish East of Rexxentrum Thats
where weve been stationed for the past six or
seven months or so Done a few jobs here and
there
 No not until they cancel it
 Like over on the border with Xhorhas
 Other than the fact that there have been
incursions and kidnappings and stuff its all
been small and localized within the borders but
Bladegardens there for a reason and
Talonstadt
  What are you looking for
 Hm a good time To be perfectly honest if
youre looking for wining dining and various
nightly pleasures my faith does not allow for
that so Im a very bad source but and he turns
around
 Oh Legal trouble or illegal trouble
 If youre going to go illegal you can
actually go just beyond the boundaries of the
Empire to Shadycreek Run Entire haven for
murderers thieves and all sorts of strange
people
 There is Deastok to the west as well as
Kamordah Theres quite good drink in Kamordah
Theres Prides Call if you like the jovial
dwarvenfolk there Much less dark and intense as
Grimgolir because theyre right on the boundary
and most of them are fighting for the war as well
Personally Rexxentrums got it all
 Yeah that it is
 Not privately no Like I said Ive only
been here for about a little over a half a year
To me its not been too bad
 You as well my friends Drink deep Play
hard
 Okay You do notice as Darrow leaves he
does have a medallion around his neck that
previously was hidden under his armor It is the
symbol of the Dawnfather
 The Dawnfathers legal here
 As the rest of the folk are exiting out you
guys have basically waited to close down the
party Most of the servants are cleaning up and
finishing up the space The Starosta begins to
leave and make his way out there with his
companions and theyre chatting
 Classiest Classy
 Oh yeah of course Jester  No you told
him it was Fancypants
 Fancypants McGee
 Right right Yes 
 Fair enough What can I do for you
 He gives a look and goes Uh and looks
back and forth between his companions He goes
What are you insinuating
 Right Right
 Right I really appreciate that offer
Genuinely Jester Fancypants McGee However such
is my life 
 Maybe in a week Give me some time A lot of
stuff percolating right now but Leaky Tap right
 Or the Pillow Trove All right well I may
have use of your services soon Not at the moment
but soon
 I appreciate that Soon He is trying
desperately to not make the wrong impression to
his friends He darts off with them into the
night
 Make a constitution saving throw Beau
 Iron stomach Beauregard over here
 Since youve been in town Its probably
been a week and a half to two weeks
 At this point now
 Oh no now its probably about 
 
oclock
 All right You exit from the forum the
Victory Pit out into the night The event is
still going on though most of the people have filtered out
Everyone who remains is either pretty tossed or is in the
process of closing down their various carts and
established places of sale The Pentamarket is

the outer wall the gates open the guards there

to approach as your troupe begins to arrive One
of them steps up goes Halt please weve Oh

 One of them is the guy that kicked him
originally Hes not the one that interfaced with
you but hes standing by the side there just
waiting He watches you approach as you walk by
and he goes
 He swallows and doesnt respond Just looks
off in the distance
 As you guys make your way through the
streets of the TriSpire
 Okay
 Theres the group ahead of you maybe 
feet and youre approaching the exterior of the
Pillow Trove
 Do you consent to this piggyback ride
 Thats amazing Theres the Zauber Spire
glistening and lit from beneath Assembled and no
longer akimbo You guys approach the exterior of
the Pillow Trove Theres these steps that ascend
to the entryway the arched door frame and you
enter the beautiful
 As you make your way into the
 The Pillow Trove in its beautiful marvel
presentation there awaits you as you come into the
welllit interior Theres a number of candles
that are hanging on small hooks in the walls and
dangle there and the flames flicker to light the
archway and the inside There you see sitting at
the table going through a stack of parchment is
Madam Luenna who you had briefly seen before in
this beautiful red dress
 Well kept almost bouncy brunette hair and
golden eyes and she smiles as you enter Hello

 I do remember yes Good to see you

the festival but congratulations

 Well it doesnt work that way my dear
 All right How many rooms would you like
 Two rooms All right

 For each room
 This was her ceding to the Victory Pit

 Okay so you head to where you went
previously which is a little side chamber
Theres a young woman there waiting who is
falling asleep at the desk Oh Im sorry I
didnt see you there Can I help you
 Oh Well very well done
 Name
 Jester Hold on just a second She gets up
and walks out of the room A minute passes Two
minutes pass
 On the desk of this woman who has left
There looks to be a small oil lantern set there
thats flickering Its wellmade
 No it looks like she took it with her
 About five minutes pass before she enters
with a small parcel under her arm and goes I
believe this is to you Jester correct Its a
small box about that big it says Jester written
in nice handwriting on it
 She does have her hand open
 Thank you very much madam Have a wonderful
night and stay here at The Pillow Trove
 As you guys head back the keys are given
out to both of you The madam leads you up to your
chambers On your way up she goes Are there any
other services that you will require while youre
staying here this evening to celebrate
 All kinds of services
 Wine can be delivered Companionship can be
provided
 Ah well You see her trying to find the
words for it She goes Likely the best kind of
companionship you can find
 No I know of her She has a reputation
But we have fine companions here as well to
 She has a great reputation yes But she
works outside of the Empire Should you be
interested we have a number of individuals across
the spectrum who would be happy to lend you an
ear and help ease your mind
 How about you come and find me when youve
decided whether or not
 The madam leaves
 The Cobalt Soul You know of them in the
way that you know of the people at City Hall that
keep all the records of buildings and such You
know it exists everyone knows its part of the
structure but nobody really pays much attention
because its a place of learning beyond what the
usual learning process is Certain people would
 Kind of yeah People know it
exists but the few people that really take an
interest in it either end up pursuing it or
adjacently to it Those people end up acquiring
more knowledge and end up becoming more prominent in
the society Its almost an unused resource
unfortunately
 Within the Empire Theyre one of the many
sanctioned places of worship for the Knowing
Mistress But theyre with the Empire they
function within the Empire and the individuals
that run each Archive are appointed by the Crown
As with all places of worship in the kingdom
whoever helms those locations the High Priest
the High Archivist whoever they are they are
appointed by the Crown and work directly for the
Empire All religion here is employed by the
Empire at the highest point
 Thats after winter unfortunately You have
to wait until spring for those to come around
again God I miss those
 Yeah it was amazing
 Guys Readings cool No legitimately it
is
 You head to your rooms at the Pillow Trove
 First off the package as you shake it a
bit it has various objects inside of it It
rattles a bit
 No
 Its about eight to ten pounds As you open
the package and unwrap it its pretty well
wrapped you open the parcel and on the inside
there is a bag of coin about that big there
 There is a small bundle thats wrapped with
twine and theres a letter
 Okay The package contains a vial about that
big filled with dark liquid You shake it there
 You do She keeps it usually by her
materials Its a bottle of her lavender perfume
 Its a smell thats very much affiliated
with her and as you smell it a wave of nostalgia
comes over you Your childhood flashes through you
again Within that bundle as well you see there
are five small ink vials of different colors
Theres a red ink theres a blue ink theres a
green ink and then two black
 Magenta cyan 
 And  gold in the pouch
 Okay All right so you head downstairs
 The madam goes Well I can definitely

evening to relax You all eventually get
yourselves comfortable Caleb youre reading

Marisha to leave
 Oh sure Well then
 Can we retrieve the rest of the group
please Back to the table 
 We got a Caleb lore dump
 Got a Caleb lore dump As you find
yourselves reading for a bit eventually a knock
comes at the door and a little bit of snacks are
brought over from the side of the girls room if
you want some The food arrives at your guys
room and the knock does come at your room Molly
As the food arrives the door opens and the
two
 The food has arrived as the companions and
you have completed your evening
 If theres something else you want to do
 Then you may go to the bathroom if youd
like and were going to come back in the
morning
 Whenever the rest of our group returns
 Well until they get here
 Gotcha no worries  Pregnancy
 As the evening draws to a close you all get
probably the finest rest youve had in a while
Its extravagant rooms the inner chambers are
welldecorated the morning window as the
drapery is left open the sun comes through in
golden beams
 Its the morning time You guys come to
consciousness
 You gather yourselves What are you guys
doing with the day
 All right
 Yeah you guys have all woken up and gotten
together again Well say for purposes of this
that breakfast has been provided like brought to
your room as part of the staying over but you
finish your morning
 Upperend continental
 There you go
 You backing her up
 Yeah theyre lying through their teeth
 Sure
 Yeah Theyre less paints and more colored
inks You can purchase paints wherever you want
to but these are like
 But you have paints to do it
 You paint her a little picture
 
 Postage for sending it off is simple enough
at that size to be about five silver from here to
Nicodranas
 To Dolans first
 All right Whos going where
 Pumat library The rest of you guys are
going to Dolans
 So As you guys
 As you guys exit the Pillow Trove and you
make your way outside of the TriSpires the first
thing of note is the tone and the mood of the city
has shifted dramatically
 No First things first The skies are gray
What little bits of sunlight came through the last
day have completely absconded The sky is covered
in gray nearly stormy clouds There is an air of
stress and question in the streets as you start
seeing Righteous Brand groups making their way
through As you make your way through the north
side of the Pentamarket one of the town criers
comes by shouting War declared on the Kryn by
the King in retribution of attack on eastern
garrisons
 Another one a few moments later further
down the way shouts out Righteous Brand
mobilizing east to protect our families Spare
what provisions you can to ensure victory and
support our defenders There are clusters of
Righteous Brand groups the full armored military
outside of the Signet Wall that have come into the
streets and are basically picking up provisions
asking for donations from anyone that can spare
things for this scenario Theyre grabbing horses
from nearby stables and it seems like since the
close of the festival through the night and into
the morning preparations have already kicked in
on the military side
 Youre already split up
 You heard bits of it as you split off You
guys heard a bit It says Crick incursion
threatening imperial borders The Starosta
recommends armed escorts for travel across the
valley A lot of these Righteous Brand soldiers
are also saying goodbye to their families Theres
a lot of people in big embraces with their
children or with their parents and theres very
much the air of the morning before the big shift
begins The Crownsguard themselves are doing the
best to keep the peace and inform people and not
keep individuals from freaking out as much but
you do see a few arguments breaking out in the
streets and theres that general tension of
Whats happening Whats going on How bad is
this But everything seems relatively under
control The Signet Wall which is to the north
side of the city which is where all the military
is usually situated you dont have a view beyond
the wall of course but you can see thats where
a large part of the Righteous Brand is emerging
into the city from Yeah there is a definite
building presence and tension in the city in
preparation for the shift eastward You guys are
heading to Dolans still
 Or what are you doing
 You guys are heading back to the Leaky Tap
 Oh the Taskboard
 Okay You guys head to the Taskboard outside
of the Kings Hall the four of you Theres the
original posting Seeking or paying for any
information on Myriad or unlawful activity within
the city Theres the reward on rebel gatherings
anticrown rhetoric that youve seen There is a
shift to the recent Righteous Brand convincing
letter It says War has found our doorstep
Defend your family from the Xhorhasian hordes by
sword or shield Good pay and adventurous living
as a soldier of the Righteous Brand Seek Leopold
Wanstiker at the Marrow Keep in the Signet Wall
The other Proof of others worship of heretical
gods paid in gold You dont see any immediate
postings for armed guards but those are probably
done privately through the merchant guilds
However as youre looking at the board a voice
Voloshin the Keeper of the Hall who you had
previously interfaced with when you did your job
in the sewers comes out in his robes and he says
Wed actually sent a page to look for you but
they mustve missed you The Lawmaster wishes to
speak with you would you come with me
 Providence it is Enter please He leads
you inside the hall of the king and there are the
two archways between the clerks center and the
Lawbearers small shrine within the chamber He
leads you down the right hallway past two sets of
doors and theres a third door on the right that
is partially ajar As you enter it you see a
spacious if rather minimalistic chamber Its a
bare chamber beyond a bookcase the desk with a
long bench in front of it and a series of three
small windows where the sunlight comes through
or the light theres not really sunlight at the
moment because of the weather Beyond that its
white marble and fairly empty There at the desk
you see her arms sprawled looking down over
clusters of parchments the Lawmaster Orentha
Stonegrasp Her gray hair has tumbled past her
shoulders and her bangs have been pulled back like
a natural circlet keeping it out of her eyes He
pushes you into the chamber she has a dark brown fur
robe on The cold morning air makes the room
especially the dark marble very cold She keeps
it on for warmth She looks up from the papers and
greets you with a smile and goes Thank you for
coming That was mighty fast Have a seat if you
dont mind Thank you Voloshin close the door
if you could Of course my dear He closes the
door leaves you in there I wasnt expecting
such a rapid response but I appreciate your
expediency
 Thats fantastic Please have a seat Id
like to discuss a few things with you if you dont
mind First off congratulations yesterday That
was quite a display and a fantastic victory Well
 I see you are aware of the shifts in our
current imperial state of affairs We havent had
war in generations Im hopeful that the conflict
is swift but Ill leave that concern to those
with the right expertise Im tasked with keeping
my people safe here not on the front Here Now
wartime puts us in an unfortunate scenario Zadash
effectively governs the southern half of the
empire and most of military might is now leaving
us Our Crownsguard will be stretched thin across
keeping the peace and dealing with unrest and
worry and protecting these walls from whatever
pushes through the lines of battle and the general
things that wander from beyond our boundaries
Money isnt an issue but personnel is There are
outlying threats and criminals we no longer have
the manpower for and as such the Crown has
approved an expanded mercenary budget Now youve
already proven your ability to me twice Most
recent your skills in the Victory Pit showing you
capable and loyal to the king I know not your
interest but if you would come under contact
under my office as legionnaires of the empire you
would be responsible for protecting the lives of
many innocent people Now under contract you
would receive  gold a week per person as
a stipend whether or not you were on contract or
not It could be at your leisure months at a time
with no work and you still get paid no matter what
you do Each assignment rewards its own bounty of
course case by case The work Ill be presenting
would largely involve the hunting of outstanding
criminals the acquisition of resources that may
benefit the Empire in this time of war and
sometimes the extermination of dangerous creatures
that threaten life away from the front lines Now
youd all have credentials within the Empire and
that will grant you access to supplies pro bono
Access to empirical halls and individuals
otherwise restricted to the general populace
 When theyre available those supplies are
a bit stretched thin and put toward the front
lines We could probably muster what we can Could
I hope for your help on this
 Dire times make for dire circumstances We
dont take lightly the ask that were giving here
 I understand thats fine She smiles
lightly the crows nests in her eyes folding in a
bit I hold no grudge against you should you
decline Thats all
 Okay
 Well should you be interested the first
contract I can discuss if you choose to sign with
us It does offer a  gold bounty
 I cant tell you until you sign the
contract
 Oh I have no choice Im in the process
and she gestures to the papers below her and
theres a stack of approval letters and reports
that have to be put out there Shes dividing what
forces that she can allow to go the eastern front
and sticking her feet in the sand on what things
she needs to maintain order in the city
 Well the issue here is that many of our
finest investigators and hunters will be sent to
the east and as such many of the criminals and
individuals that we were in the process of finding
and bringing to justice will now go free or return
and run rampant
 Well consider what Im saying At the very
least come back and notify me
 No harm no foul otherwise She leans
forward and goes Look I understand People are
as varied as they are selfish I believe in the
Empire but I definitely dont believe with all
the people that run it I do what I do because I
feel if I dont a lot of good people will be
crushed under the boot of those that misuse their
power But there are good people here and we do
what we can Ive seen the good that we can do
Thats why Im here I wish to fight for this land
that I call home to protect those who cannot
protect themselves and combat the destructiveness
and selfishness of anarchy Utopias impossible I
know that but I do what I can to make life as
livable as possible Anyway go speak with your
friends and Ill be here if you need me
 If the war makes it here then were in far
more trouble than I anticipated
 Thank you I should get back to work She
rubs her hands and gets back down to the paper
The door opens behind and Voloshin leads you back
out of the Kings Hall
 She gives a nod and a wave
 You guys are escorted out of the Kings Hall
and left back out to the streets
 As you guys get to The Leaky Tap you see
near the front door a young page wearing similar
though simpler robes as Voloshin and members of
the Kings Hall who approaches and goes Oh hi
Im sorry I was sent to give you this summons
from the Lawmaster
 Very well and then runs off You guys
gather your supplies and start making your way
back towards the Pentamarket The three of you
where are you going
 You make your way towards the Archive of the
Cobalt Soul here in Zadash The same beautiful
building with the large steepled tower top
 As you guys make your way to the front
archway of the entrance of the archive there is
the main signin bench which has the large tome
thats on a small pedestal where you sign in to
enter the facility and then youre greeted by one
of the archivists who approaches You recognize
this individual as Madeer Has olivecolored
skin short dark hair approaches with a smile
Beauregard you come with companions
 Fantastic What is it you seek this day
 History can be done Arcanists can be done
Please do sign in here
 And your friend
 No surname very well I will be escorting
you as well Come Madeer leads you into the
library For the first time you guys seeing it it
is overwhelming Its strange For as much as
theres a very calm almost cathedrallike
structure on the exterior the interior of the
chambers have a curved organic feel to the way
its situated and organized The bookshelves wrap
around these walls these separate antechambers
that are broken up like ventricles of a heart In
each one it is floor to foot ceiling filled
books with large shifting ladders that glide
across poles and wheels There are a number of
tables and small nooks where individuals are in
the process of taking notes or reading through
Its not super crowded Theres maybe eight other
people in the facility at this time Obviously the
city is very occupied with other things at the
moment Its not like theres a huge constant
need for this and the people in here are usually
regulars A lot of older folks people who tend to
spend their later life wanting to read and learn
 You are led to a section Madeer reads
through Arcanists you say Historically Are we
talking Age of Arcanum
 I believe so
 A few tomes are retrieved This here is a
recollection of what elements of historical
significance could be pulled from the remnants of
the Age of Arcanum preCalamity There are a
great number of mages out there though many of
them befell darker interests But here are those
books If youre looking for more modern mages we
have historical information on the past  years
of empirical magecraft and powerful wizards in
that realm
 Explain what you mean by unexplained
please
 That would be more Soltryce Academy
material They do lay claim to most of those
theoretical discussions and research The Cerberus
Assembly would be the keepers of those research
endeavors
 I have a book here on the Cerberus
Assembly if that would be of interest to you
 These tomes are presented to you You can
spend time to read if youd like Madeer watches
the entire time like a hawk
 Which book do you go through first
 Okay Are you absorbing it or are you
skimming through
 Cover to cover will take you the better part
of the day
 Youre a speed reader but this is also very
dense material and it is essentially a historical
theorizing on historical elements theyve been
able to piece together Id say by the time youve
gotten here itd be about noon in the day
 Yes and Id say youd finish this book by
 You want me to just tell you all the
history
 What are you looking for You have to give
me something to go on here otherwise this is
going to turn into an hour and a half of me
telling you about the history of the Age of
Arcanum
 Okay There are discussions about
transmutation on a powerful level It involves the
creation of turning mountains into mobile clouds
It speaks of in the Age of Arcanum there were
floating cities There was arcane technology
utilized in that period which was this magical
utopia but a lot of that was lost in the war
partially because a lot of these mages when they
had developed magic to this point werent
satiated with their mortal capabilities and that
was when they were easily corruptible by the
betrayer gods Then it goes into discussion of the
Calamity Magics that can alter the fabric of
reality exist out there Some of them appear to be
myth some have been wiped from time and history
because theyve been voted too dangerous and
theyre supposedly under lock and key in other
places of the world if not completely eradicated
because it was not fit to leave them in the hands
of mortals
 Yes
 It speaks on theories and manipulations of
if youre looking for things realitybased
realitys a big scope Transmutation specifically
most of what you can glean from this discusses the
idea of turning from one creature to another
turning from one substance to another how they
would be able to build fortresses out of stone and
then turn it to diamond for extra protective
elements and those were the great palaces of that
age
 You find some discussion of it You find
some discussion of the manipulation of time but
what minor manipulation is capable through magic
is merely to slow or expedite what happens
Accelerating time to a certain degree becomes very
dangerous and there is talk of some mages that
have attempted to reverse time in short stints
and that process is both very taxing and in the
past has completely annihilated those who toyed
with that power It speaks specifically of two
different mages who believed that they could
possibly alter choices alter elements of their
past to benefit their future their gaining of
power and influence One was turned to dust the
other was never seen again
 It has been frustrating but fine
 Zeenoth is a great friend
 I have not seen her this morning but I
dont know if shes left or not
 You read through that tome Its about three
in the afternoon now
 It has a breakdown of previous members who
passed away Its basically a historical dialogue
of how it was established The name was actually a
reference to a group that existed in the Age of
Arcanum It talks about how there was a war of
mage houses  years ago within the empire that
nearly destroyed part of the capital Rexxentrum
and as part of the ceasefire and the arrest of
these mage houses that were at war as opposed to
imprisoning them they agreed to bind themselves
to the empire and work for them Thats what the
under rule of the king Since then has flourished
Its helped the kingdom rise to power it helped
them conquer the Julous Dominion They work with
and under the king It talks of all the members
and it talks about what they do Trent is in
there There is Master Trent Ikithon who is the
Archmage of Civil Influence Civil Influence is
the title and it talks about how he is the
propagandist and the constructor of the face of
the Empire in upperechelon circles It speaks of
Martinet Lunidus Daleth who is the Archmage of
Domestic Protections who is the oldest in the
original member of the Assembly who still lives
Was there when it was built and is currently
considered the leader of the Assembly It speaks
of Marquis Jenna Iresor who is the Archmage of
Industry One of the younger members of the
Assembly There is Master Doolan Tversky who is
the Archmage of Dysology
 DYSOLOGY There is
 There is Lord Athesias Uludan who is the
Archmage of Diplomatic Union There is Lady Vess
DeRogna who is the Archmage of Antiquity Ill
send you these later Its fine Ill send you an email
 There is Headmaster Zivan Margolin who is
the Archmage of Conscription Then there is
Headmaster Oremid Hass who is the Archmage of
Cultivation Those are the eight members
currently
 Oh there is a lot more information
 Doolan
 Yeah burrowing vision into your neck
 Of course Good day
 Good to see you Beauregard He escorts
you out of the Archive
 Yeah and theres a whole second level above
the spiral staircase
 You guys what have you been up to during
this time Because its been a number of hours
 Youve gathered all your materials You went
and checked on your cart which is now
currently
 Okay that is a nasty fucking manticore
head The flesh has sloughed off of it at this
point Yeah its pretty rough You have your
cart the horses are still there The horses you
had at least
 As you focus on it theres nothing really
there until your hand touches it and then theres
a momentary connection You feel the thrumming of
the object this dull heartbeat Your vision goes
tunneled until youre pulled into this space of
light and stars distant gases and colors There
you see beyond this brief journey this sense of
self dissipating At the moment where it gets a
little scary and you being to lose a sense of
personal identity you see this tiny gray mote of
energy before you thats also pulsing with that
same pattern You instinctively reach out and feel
as you absorb it into yourself and there the
fragment of
 Did you say anything
 Your vision has come back to you and you
feel this
 Well say for the purposes of expediency
and you guys lolling around a little bit to try
and catch up you all arrive at Pumat Sols in
roughly the same time in the Pentamarket As you
enter the interior of the chamber you can see the
three Pumats are dusting and staring off because
there are currently no other people making
purchases inside Most of the business and chaos
people dealing with the initial shock and
preparation stage of this coming scuffle with the
East As you enter the first Pumat glances over
in your direction Oh hello there Its real
interesting morning times What can I do for
you
 Unfortunately you guys have pretty much
cleaned me out and what little bits I had were
snatched up bright and early this morning by the
Righteous Brand
 Generally I dont like to plug rival
purveyors here in the city
 Because were at war
 No but I mean its that time of year right
now apparently where war happens Thats a
problem
  No
 I dont think thats any of our fates right
now isnt that right boys Theyre all like
Yeah no thats No warfares not my thing
 Unfortunately youve taken the bulk of
what was there other than a few odds
and ends that you couldnt afford previously
 We got a little more paper yeah
 Certainly That can be provided We still
have that little pearl thing we got the
bracelets but thats all we got at the moment
Mister Prime back there is hard at work He turns
back and you hear this voice like Yeah Got a lot
of stock to kick up now You cleared me out for a
while which thanks for that
 Oh this heres a pearl that allows you to
go ahead and utilize your magical capabilities
Lets see here Yeah you use a command word and
it allows you to regain one of your spells
 This one runs you roughly about  gold
pieces
 All righty by all means
 Once per day
 Well here you are if you would like
to
 It is
 Theres this enchanted shield here which
we discussed previously That has an enchantment
to its deflection capabilities so it will help
improve your chances of avoiding dangerous
physical contact via weaponry and other sources
Then these here are this pair of bracers are able
to do a similar scenario given you dont have too
many types of hide or metal in the way to prevent
the enchantment from protecting you but
 Well nah it only works if you dont have
any armor or shield
 Yeah sorry
 That one will run you back about 
gold
 Let me go ahead and check there for a
second those are generally smallerscale here
Pumat III if you dont mind I got it already
listening to you dont worry He goes up a small
ladder in the far corner into an attic place and
you hear some rustling around as the other Pumats
are there patiently watching So yeah crazy war
times huh
 Oh this here enchanted shield will run you
about  gold pieces
 Fair enough About five minutes pass and
then the Pumat comes down hes got a small bound
cluster of bolts and he goes Hey so its all we
got but weve got a batch here of ten enchanted
crossbow bolts These upon firing should offer a
small batch of fiery impact on whatever you strike
with them
 For each of these its  gold per bolt
 Two bolts here you go
 He passes them over to you These bolts
upon impact do an additional d fire damage
 You have two of them and its one use
only
 You may have a chance of recovering them
depending
 Any other business you want to do before you
decide to leave the city
 Okay Yeah
 In the interest of time Jasna Bree who is
a rather eccentric woman with wild black hair a
slightly hard to follow disposition greets you
and is like Hi Welcome Glad you could make it
Healing potions yes Unfortunately kind of
already cleared out Im so sorry Give me a week
I will have a fresh batch of healing potions and
Id be happy to help
 I do I do
 I have four
 For each its let me check She goes
into her ledger
 Yeah it works out well
 With herbalism kits
 I believe you would yes
 Correct it is five gold per
 You have to have proficiency with it to make
a potion of healing Are you proficient with
herbalism kit
 It would be under your proficiencies
 Sorry
 Okay There you go
 Yeah she easily has materials and sells
them to you
 Not potions You can make poisons acid
various alchemical concepts but thats the gist of it
 No She is purely a purveyor of salves and
natural remedies and
 Yeah
 Yes
 The healers kit usually can be used to
stabilize somebody Theres a feat you can take
that allows you to spend an action to heal someone
with it in combat Its called the Healer feat
Which is actually pretty cool
 It turns anybody into a combat healer
 Whos helming that
 Make an investigation check
 Shes helping you with it Its advantage on
you
 You gather the knowledge of this war has
blindsided most of the merchant guilds in Zadash
Best you can tell most of them are in the process
of getting ready to figure out what their next
endeavor is Those that would be leaving wont be
leaving for a few days If you hang around you
may be able to pick up that kind of work
 As you guys make your way back to the Kings
Hall you are escorted back into Orentha
Stonegrasps office I see youve returned I
appreciate your expediency in getting back to me
Her crackling Southern drawl breaking through with
her bright dwarven smile Considering what weve
discussed what have you come to a conclusion
on
 I understand
 I understand thats all right
 I hope so Well send someone else after
the Hawker
 The Hawker
 Dont worry about it
 HAWK
 No He actually was a legionnaire for us
about five years back but then went rogue and we
believe had ties with the Myriad and became a
powerful tentpole here in the Marrow Valley We
had him cornered in Deastok about three months ago
by a team of crownsguard under the leadership of
Carlos Ventuga But this Hawker slew Carlos and
fled south into the Wuyun Gorge and disappeared
into the Menagerie Coast Were having to send
whoever we can to try and retrieve him and bring him
back alive
 Yes
 If you need more time thats fine
 No but the longer it takes the easier he
probably has vanishing into the south
 We sent a troupe after him about eight
weeks ago and I fear they may not be coming back
at this point We intended to send some of our top
investigators from the capital after this
bounty
 Its  gold alive  dead
 Unfortunately if this is to happen I need
you under contract
 Im good I appreciate your
conscientiousness
 Im all right but thank you
 Its fine
 Retrieving this man and bringing him back
here for justice
 The contract has you as a legionnaire and
as part of that you just
 Well until we decide to mutually end your
service
 Well if you wish out of it we can discuss
it its fine But I mean as opposed to deserting
is the problem
 He ran away and then allied himself we
believe with the Myriad and then has since upon
attempting to bring him in murdered some of our
finest men
 Part of the bounty would still apply Im
sure
 Probably half
 Think about it
 You guys can discuss this over the next week
if you want You dont need to decide this right now
 Its fine Return when you have an idea
Youre led outside and start making your way to
the Leaky Tap to discuss your plan of action
There waiting
 As you guys head back to The Leaky Tap the
Righteous Brand are making their way through the
city Its a weirdly solemn unexpected military
parade essentially as theyre just gathering
supplies and making their way through Its a show
of strength to help rise the spirits of people
that seem confused and worried about this coming
conflict So it does seem to calm nerves and a lot
of the children seem excited to see them Coming
down the streets on their horses and their
armaments on display While youre watching it go
by a voice whispers up next to you and goes
Psst hey You turn and you see hood up Kara
Sorry dont mean to bother you If you have a
moment things are getting strange around here and
The Gentleman may have a bit of work for you

 Well pick up from there next week You guys
made quite a display last night in the Victory Pit
 Yeah I know
 Picking up on that However you guys do
level up You hit level five
 That means lets all roll some hit points to
finish off the evening here
 Yeah
 So well start over here well go in order
Whatd you get Beau
 There you go
 Whatever your constitution modifier is
 Ten extra hit points to Beau Whatd you
get Nott
 Roll a d
 Nice
 I believe for a warlock its also a d
Caleb is a d hes the only one Warlock is a d
but it adds a plus
 Whatd you get
 d yeah
 Nice
 You are as a cleric yes
 Five okay d for you
 You guys are all rolling above average nice
 d for you
 Shit you guys rolled really good this time
well done
 Itll be your constitution modifier so a
plus two to that for  hit points So add  and
it should give you 
 For Molly Beau and Yasha that means your
attack action now does two attacks You get an
extra ki point Casters all get level three
spells Thats pretty great And your proficiency
bonus goes up by one So all your proficient
skills proficient attacks spell DCs and spell
attack modifiers all go up by one I think its
all going to be included in there already in the
app Its a good level
 Correct
 Beau also gets Stunning Strike
 This is my favorite part Watching people
realize what they get when they level up
 Yep
 Thats part of the reason that Vax survived
so much in the last campaign
 No its just your reaction once a round
 Yeah
 Yes you do get another blood curse you get
to choose
 Then you get of course rdlevel spells
and you get another invocation You can mess with
it later
 Its late afternoon at this point You guys
are coming back right as you met with Kara there
 Yasha your speed increases by ten which is
nice Thats some fun stuff Well leave it there
and well pick up next week in this prewar chaos
Guys thank you so much for hanging with us I
hope you had a good time We had a good time
Well be back next Thursday see where this goes
as choices paths avenues and possibilities all
begin to arise
 Yeah it automatically puts it up
 Okay lets do it Happy birthday
 I love you were going to get Taco Bell
 I think so All right guys thank you so
much well see you next week We love you and is
it Thursday yet Good night

 Hello and welcome back Wow youre going
back to basics tonight
 Apparently going back full circle Back at
have been caught up in the political turmoil of
the Empire noticing that the king has declared
war on the eastern realm of Xhorhas specifically
the Kryn dynasty There was an assault on one of
the garrisons in the east There were many lives
lost and the sky now darkens Youve begun to
decide what it is you can do and what your current
plan of action is As you began to gather your
things as you decide where your next trajectory
would be you were summoned to the Kings Hall
and brought before the Lawmaster of the town of
Zadash She implored you if youre interested
having proven your mettle in the past and in the
Victory Pit not too long ago if youd be
interested as signing off as legionnaires to help
aid protect and do work for the Empire at home
while all the military forces of the Righteous
Brand had moved to the east to engage with the
enemy You took it under consideration and left
went back to gather some more supplies at your
inn You were delivered a missive from an old
friend Kara saying the The Gentleman would like
to speak with you That was where we left off
Mighty Nein having just returned to the Leaky
Tap being briefly met with Kara who delivered
this information and then vanished back into the
afternoon what would you like to do
 If I recall its later afternoon
 And we got there
 Its late afternoon I believe
 You make your way across the Pentamarket to
the familiar down dank and broody interior of
the Evening Nip tavern You pass by Clive who
gives you a nod You head towards the hidden
staircase down to the subterranean tavern There a
different sound catches your ears Theres the
familiar sound of warm music and tavern flair but
you also hear rowdy shouts and cheers and the
occasional sound of something heavy against a
skidding table As you slowly descend toward the
base of the curved staircase to enter the main
chamber you can see some folks are sitting at the
tables The Gentleman is in his far corner at the
back and theyre all watching a small circle of
people in the center as two individuals in the
process of beating the shit out of each other
Bare fists bare knuckled People are making bets
laughing and cheering and throwing beer and
various objects into the ring to mess with them
It is midcraze scuffle at the moment
 As you guys step down into the main area
the large ogre bodyguard stands and turns back
His low guttural grunt come through his protruding
jawline with a  and gives you a sign to continue inward
 All right
 Getting a glimpse here as you watch a bit of
parting between shoulders as everyones standing
end to end You hear this heavy crack and the two
people nearest to you bow backward Apparently
one of the two fighting individuals being thrusted
into the circle is immediately pushed back into
the center You hear another couple of swings go
before they both breakaway You can hear the heavy
breaths of them now exhausted pouring with sweat
You recognize them one is Louis one of the
agents who fled from the research facility that
you were then going after and the other is Thed
the halfling fellow with the neck tattoo that you
saved in the sewers not but a week and half
earlier They are both bloodied
 Yes
 Yes They are both bloodied and tensely
attempting to pummel the other into
unconsciousness The people seem to be happily
cheering it on as they go
 There were three people that went there and
fled the research facility
 Yes
 Jester ascends to one of the nearby untaken
tables and watches down into the mix Thed crawls
upward fists up in front of his face trying to
guard He goes for a duck and comes in for an
uppercut Louis slaps it away but it still
manages to catch the edge of his jaw He slaps his
head a little bit to the side and as such he
pushes off and gives a kick to the chest of Thed
who falls back a second and goes to his back leg
and comes forward with a huge haymaker Louis
tries to back out of the way but it comes at an
upward angle slams into the side of his temple
You watch as his face goes starry eyed for a
second as he tries to grab the edge of one of the
chairs to catch himself Thed runs up and then
knees him right in the center of the chest and
stomach region and you hear the 
The whole group goes Oh around and you watch
as Louis pushes off the chair and steps back and
tries to back swing towards Thed Thed slaps it
out of the way and goes in for a headbutt Its
at this point that Louis appears to have pulled
something from his back pocket and as he swings
his hand upwards a scattering of sand and dust
goes into Theds face who backs up going pained
yell starts to rub it right into his face He
begins to step away trying to get his fists up
Louis uses the opportunity to go forward and sweep
his legs out from under him As he hits the
ground chest up he goes into a double handed
hammer fist right down into Theds chest The air
escapes him Once again the crowd goes Oooh
Theres a slight in the back from the Gentlemen
whos trying to watch over the shoulders of everybody
 This first time hes acknowledged your
entry he gives you a look over going a bit of a
smile from the distance Louis goes for a
secondary blow However Thed manages to push off
His smaller halfling form able to dexterously
dodge out of the way Hes got one eye partially
open the other one watering thick and he waits
and paces himself for a moment Louis however
follows up behind it very quickly and goes for a
knee straight to Theds face It slams in and as
he backs up you can see the nose is permanently
pushed to one side and blood is pouring down the
front of his face He has a hand up You cant
tell if hes going to say hes going to stop or if
hes trying to defend and theres no one looking
over this battle to stop it if it happens
 Louis comes in to try and finish off what he
started Thed waits for the final moment and then
ducks down below gets underneath and between the
legs of Louis and lifts throwing him up ass
over tea kettle until he slams on the back of the
ground He turns around wiping the other eye out
of the way He pulls his leg up and attempts to
stomp down onto Louiss neck and connects
Immediately theres a  and hes holding
him to the ground and jamming and grinding his
heel into his throat Everyones shouting Get
him
 Louis is desperately trying to pull the boot of
Thed up off his throat but Theds able to keep it
down Hes pushing and pushing He spits blood
right in the face of Louis like onto one of his
eyes The consciousness of Louis begins to fade
eyes roll back and then eventually as the rest
of his body goes limp they pull Thed off Yeah
They cheer and lift him up and carry him off They
pull Louis up into a chair and start slapping
him and pour water in his face He
comes to consciousness and spits out a tooth and
then the crowds energy begins to die down a bit
and they drag them to different sides of the room
and the people being to go about their business
get another drink at the bar
 As youre doing that some of the crowd that
had began to disperse suddenly turns and starts
tapping each other
  Do you wa Okay
 You both charge into the center starting
seemingly with no purpose other then the necessary
adrenaline to kickstart the rest of your evening
 I need you both to roll initiative
 Roll initiative
 Okay but Hold on let me check real fast
 Saving throws not ability checks You dont
get advantage on your initiative
 You feel this sudden strange surge of
adrenaline and energy Time around you seems to
slow ever so slightly as you watch Jester starting
rushing in swinging towards you faster than you
expect though What are you doing
 At first level
 Okay so its a relatively soft punch as
youre using it as a delivery method for the spell
 So it doesnt do any actual punch damage
However you do have to roll to see if you
connect so a melee spell attack
 Go ahead and roll damage
 I believe that d necrotic
 Lets thumb wrestle and you shoot him in
the head Like what
 Suddenly your energy is instilled within
your body your vision goes wide all the colors
come into focus and you look up to see Jester to
distract yourself from the sudden sensation youve
never experienced before The one thing you see is
this fist connect with your chest and you all
watch as a series of blood vessels in the sides of
Beauregards face and neck suddenly burst and
splash blood in different directions You see
white for a second Your body racked with pain and
you recoil briefly from the sudden shock to your
system
 Youve got two attacks now
 You dont have your shield for this because
youre fist fighting So your AC is technically two lower
 Whats your AC normally
 Yeah
 You roll damage
 And then she has to make a saving throw I
believe its a constitution saving throw
 Seven points of bludgeoning damage as she
begins to pummel you repeatedly across the front
of the face down into the side of the torso and
I need you to roll a constitution saving throw
please Jester
 Okay as she continues down your torso
theres one portion on the back of your armor
where your spine is exposed beyond the clothing
youre wearing and after she finishes the round
she uses the momentum and strikes straight into
base of the spine where the nerve would divide
down to the pelvis and your entire body locks up
all your muscles all spasm at once You are stunned
 The haste doesnt give you a fourth attack
What does haste does is it gives you
 An extra attack action yeah You have your
bonus action so yeah You can attack with your
staff if you want to whatever your main attack is
and then you still have your bonus action
 Yes
 Correct
 Hold on she is stunned
 Attack rolls against her are at advantage
You roll again
 This hit you do pull back and hit the armor
unfortunately and your fingers snap back a bit
you feel the numbness from the attack
 Mmhmm
 That hits Roll damage
 Thats six bludgeoning damage to you As
Beau recoils from this and steadies herself from
this round Jester you are unable to move Youre
sluggishly trying to get your joints to function
again you try and speak and it comes out in a
stuttering phrase that fades away your tongue not
listening to your impact
five Level five
 Too close to home
 That ends your turn Back to Beau
 You are no longer stunned
 Let me double check and see when the actual
stun wears off
 Until the end of your next turn so you
still have advantage on attacks against her
  points of bludgeoning damage as the staff
slams right into your clavicle shoulder area
almost knocking you off your feet
 Correct yes
 Technically youre still stunned until the
end of her turn
  hits
 This is still the second strike with the
staff after one knocking her back from the
shoulder blow
 The wind gets knocked out of you from a
sudden blow to your stomach area
 All right go ahead and take your damage
 All of a sudden your vision goes black For
whatever reason where we saw the brief burst of
the veins from the first strike from Jester you
watch as bits of crimson begin to pour out the
corners of Beaus mouth as her eyes go over
black
 You dont have advantage its just a
straight roll for your attacks
 Eventually your vision comes back but your
knuckles hurt from the fact that you just punched
twice in the thickest parts of her breast plate
 Because of haste you do Yes and that one
has advantage
 That hits Roll damage
 And with that
 Jester got one good opening blow and
then
 I mean partially but you also chose a fist
fight against a monk which is a rough scenario
 The whole crowd goes Yeah
 Jesters unconscious
 You watch as one of the patrons of the bar
comes up with a small jug of
water and throws it in her face
 Shes at one hit point
 Not at the moment no and youre still
affected by it
 At about this point in the conversation the
adrenaline leaves your body and you almost keel
over You become suddenly super lethargic and
exhausted
 The crowd begins to go back to their
scenarios Some of them seem confused by the
display of joyous hugging afterwards
Some seem to be down with it and are like
Yeah this is what it is about
 Sitting on one of the table edges you see
Dweez the little creepy gnome who you met
earlier whos like 
 At this point a familiar voice kicks up
from the back corner Friends come sit Thank
you for such a fine display of sportsmanship
 Apparently The Gentleman now sits there
His comfortable attire today comes in a billowing
linen a dark navy blue shirt that frills at the
wrists You can see his rings and jewelry
available as his fingers are crossed and partially
stapled steepled in front of him Not stapled to
him Thats a whole different thing Ah Oh god
 You spend an hour here and youll be fine
Thank you for coming so quickly
 Rather tenuous times these are wouldnt
you say Word is the breach of the Ashguard
Garrison was a massacre and now the skies there
hang dark with illmagic Im glad thats hundreds
of miles from here though Now with the bulk of
the military moving east and the Crownsguard
stretched thin we should begin bolstering our
plots yes
 Well a distracted empire is an easy empire
to bend to our will Or at least to not pay
attention to what were doing
 Oh I have no interest in political
endeavors Just the more confused they are the
better for business
 I have a few possible jobs here if youre
interested I dont mean to act so quickly but
word comes to me that you had been summoned to the
Kings Hall I would hate to think I missed the
opportunity to get more work under your wing
before losing you to some unfortunate statebased
conscription First order of business should you
be interested He leans forwards and sets his
glass a little further from the edge His voice
hushes a bit as he leans in Ive some friends to
the north whom Ive been needing to reconnect
with Allies who would be very profitable
partners in these times Im rather strapped for
attention at the moment and I have a hard time
trusting some of these other louts with detailed
missions
 Anyway if you have any interests
 Indeed You glance back over your shoulder
and see Louis at the bar whos still dazed and
drinking a giant cup of ale and wiping the blood
off of his whole torso If youve interest in
making coin doing some interesting work and
getting to see most of our beautiful imperial
countryside I can go on
 An old friend of mine named Ophelia
Mardun She has a base of operations about 
miles northeast of here Past Nogvurot and the
Quannah Breach on the outskirts of Shadycreek
Run Im sure youve heard of it
 A sovereign town outside of the Dwendalian
Empire and outside of the law That uses the
Savalierwood to keep the Crown at bay Spoken of
as a haven for criminals thieves murderers but
really its home to the truly free entrepreneurs
of Wildemount and criminals thieves and
murderers Now Ophelia is unable to enact on any
partnerships at the moment as her current
business is tangled up in some of the local
riffraff and shes requested aid in stabilizing
her situation What I propose as youve already
proven yourselves effective problem solvers
selfstarters with enough sense of honor to see a
deal through is for you all to travel northward
past the Silberquel Ridge to Shadycreek Run to
parlay with Ophelia Help her in absolving her
from her current mire of complications and return
with her here to Zadash For this task completed
I offer an advance of  gold pieces and a purse
of  gold pieces upon returning with Miss
Mardun within the month
 Yes
 She will once you manage to free her from
her predicament
 I do not That is the intent and language
she used when last we had correspondence I think
the nature of her business much like ours is
meant to be on an absolutely necessary basis only
Im sure once you speak to her youll have better
information on that
 I do If this seems to be beyond your
depth Id hate to see the coin go to someone
else but I understand
 Understood That underground tunnel that
youve already visited happens to be a major
artery for our smuggling business leading
straight up to the Lebenda Swamp The Lebenda
Swamp is a useful place to lose things or people
until you need to find them As well as a direct
route to my contacts in Berleben Weve been
rather worried that no shipments have made their
way south by the river in weeks After sending
your friend up to Berleben last week it was
discovered that our safe house and storage
facility in the swamp has gone dark One of my
men as well as a handful of theirs in Berleben
went to investigate and never returned Now the
swampfolk are a superstitious lot an unfortunate
facet with working with them
 And the like Im sure of it My contacts
in town are refusing to investigate recounting
howls from the deep swamp I would need you to
head up to Berleben Locate a fellow named Febron
Keyes usually hangs around the Keystone Pub in
the Puddles The Puddles is the part of the town
that is heh sinking Hes my point man for
shipments and the only one who knows where our
safe house in the swamp is that hasnt gone
fucking missing Meet with him secure the safe
house and its contents and return to me Consider
a  gold piece advance and a purse of  gold
pieces upon completion Heck if you can handle
both  and with timely mind there might be
a bonus
 Oh hes in Berleben He should be fine
This is all based in the swamp
 Febron Keyes  hes memorable
Based by his fairly emanate lack of teeth His one
wandering left eye A bit of a skin condition
 But hes good at the work he does
 Keeping his mouth shut and knowing where
the secrets are and not giving those secrets up
Hes been pressed for it a few times and has
proven to be trustworthy and I admire that
 The sooner the better as the longer these
shipments continues to elude us the more money
were losing Like I said a timely manner there
may be a bonus
 Those are the two at the moment If those
dont tickle your fancy Im sure we could have
another opportunity in the next week or two I
just would hate to see these go to less qualified
individuals
 Of course
 You mistake this business as some sort of a
push for an inherently equal pay my friend I
dont know what business the Crown wishes to offer
you but I can guarantee you it has a ceiling
 Make a persuasion check
 Youre leaning on one leg a little bit
unintentionally leaning in
 Im sure we could provide a few supplies
Remember we try not to dip into our own
contraband but we could assume that we could
provide some things yes
 We can provide paper and ink sure
 Of course Well drink be merry You know
where to find me
 There is that yeah Its more like a
shufflepuck thing with the sand on the side
 Yeah
 The darkest table is the one that is tucked
right inside the spiral staircase where you enter
 Which normally has somebody sitting there
but at the moment it looks like theyre getting a
drink If you swipe it now youll probably piss
somebody off but youll get the table
 As you guys approach you can see the same
muscular thuggish individual with the tanned skin
and the thick bracers around his rough and tumble
exterior begins to approach with a large fully
filled flagon of ale Who stops sees that youre
sitting there and grumbles to himself and finds
another seat But you are as private as you can be
in this relatively not private space You have a table
 The Branson of Wildemount
 Okay Hes back at the far table Hes
currently drinking and it looks like he has a
small book of some kind that hes thumbing
through
 Make a perception check
 In this low light its hard to see But
when you were speaking to him earlier there was a
layer of general moisture across his skin
 The shirt hes wearing now is a navy blue
linen billowy shirt open in the chest a bit you
can see a bit of his chest hair and frilled at the
sleeves
 You have a map for that
 You have to go around the Silberquel Ridge
 Lebenda Swamp
 Quannah Breach Northeast of Nogvurot
 Actually northward is not Xhorhas
technically Just east
 Yes the Greying Wildlands are in the
north
 You dont get an exhaustion point you just
become stunned for a round
 Yeah Youre fine
 No It just stuns you for one round Which
in combat is really bad
 Oh Sorah
 She is Shes not right by the Gentleman
Shes actually sitting at the table in the or
sitting at the bar  feet away from him but
shes always in his direction Shes perpetually
hawking his presence and ensuring that nobody
tries anything funny and that she can get there
quickly if she needs to
 Hes in the process of thumbing through a
small book Hes finishing a sip from his goblet
and watches you push Ah That was quicker than I
anticipated
 Which one
 Very well And youre not choosing the
Shadycreek Run
 I need it to be taken care of so if you
wont do it Ill find somebody else who can
 Time is of the essence here
 You can indeed If you do both Ill be
happy to reward you with something nice at the end
of it because thats quite a feat
 Very well Well Im happy to know were
doing business together once more I would
recommend if youre heading to Berleben and
Lebenda Swamp to take the Bromkiln Byway We do
have the river but one you have quite a number
of individuals that arent the most quiet and
there are certain things that exist throughout
that ish mile journey youd be taking underground
 Either way its still  miles to
Berleben Thats a long journey to take
underground if you are
 Not quiet and inconspicuous Our smuggling
run usually goes in groups of two to three at most
to keep it quick and unseen
 Youve already been there
 Yes
 Which is why Im saying if you choose to
otherwise thats up to you but I would recommend
taking above ground on the Bromkiln Byway Its a
wellcarried road It sees a lot of foot traffic
shouldnt be that dangerous and its nearly a
straight shot to the swamp
 Whatever decides to take up residence down
there
 You have five horses if I recall
 Seeing as how youre accepting both that
would put you in the business of acquiring the
advance from both so that would be Dweez
Please retrieve the advances  Theres a
brief break before you hear the familiar
chuckling and three large sacks are put up onto
the table  gold The advances for both
missions
 Dweez gather what we can spare from the
supply cabinet please He wanders off for a
moment and comes back with two small
overtheshoulder satchels He sets them on the
table  Opens the little lids for them
and pushes them forward You watch as one of them
falls forward and clattering out a few inches or
so some vials in there The one on the right
should be able to tend to any wounds you sustain
along the journey The one on the left can aid
you should you find yourself pricked with some
terrible disease
 Disease not poison Unfortunately we have
not that
 Two vials in one of healing Theyre both of
greater healing The other one is cure disease
 We can provide you with paper and ink
should you be so interested Dweez
 None that Ive cared to remember That
would be more of a question to my ally there if
you dont mind Speak with Febron He is very
familiar with the area and can give you the
information you seek
 No I would not ensure such a mission to
him He glances past you in the far corner you
can see him now leaning over the bar two full
cups in starting to get a little dazed on the stool
 His hand does this
 Anything else you require
 Anyway if our business is complete I
appreciate your patronage I look forward to our
continued partnership and I wish you all the
luck
 Thank you
 Dweez comes up from behind a moment later
with a stack of regular parchment and ink He
hands it over It does not look like it would be
the necessary enchanted or prepared inks that you
could use to scribe spells per se but its
parchment and ink
 Thats up to you I cant pay you unless
you come back but if you complete them both and
do so in ample time Ill be happy to pay you when
you return from both Just send word if you
could upon clearing our safehouse
 Precisely
 All right Thank you very much Good
luck
 He just glares at you Glowering at Nott as
you all step away from his corner of the chamber
 Youve almost cleared out Between you and
other patrons in the recent weeks theyve cleared
him out Its not an endless emporium
 As you do that he turns around and a hand
slaps onto your shoulder the finger and thumb of
it go from the front of your chest to your small
back as it grapples you and spins you around and
goes  and then releases you
 Four

 As he peels his large mitt off of Fjords
body and grunts he turns to the rest of the chamber
 He starts pulling at his jaw Its almost
like getting a charlie horse where you cant stop
the muscles and he tries to stop it
 Eh he probably deserved it You guys ascend
the stairs back into the main front of The Evening
Nip and the rest of the afternoon is yours What
would you like to do
 Okay Caleb is just
 Well theres some things
 Massacre in downtown Zadash this afternoon
 As you guys charge over to the Pentamarket
you make your way to the exterior of The
Invulnerable Vagrant Stepping inside there is a
rather chill customerless interior as two of
the regular Pumats sit at the front As you step
into the chamber Oh youre back so soon I
figured you had completed all your intended means
of purchasing
 I can go ahead and look Youre starting to
really diminish our stockpile
 That Im pretty sure we can supply is that
right You checking the back
I know it was there yesterday we got plenty
of incense Dont worry we got you covered He
comes back in with two sacks of very strong
pungent smelling incense that when burning has
a more pleasant scent These have been treated
specifically for rituals and various arcane means
You get  gold worth of incense at your disposal
and the  gold worth of enchanted inks and
scribing materials and paper that you can utilize
to make those notes and transition it into a spellbook
 Thats one of the few items we have left
Yeah I apologize its a little embarrassing
weve all been talking about how its really
embarrassing
Its hard to have a shop without inventory
 Oh yeah Right over here Goes and pulls
one of the boxes from the shelves It has a glass
top and he presents it to you Theres a velvet
interior with two little alcoves inside where
these very beautiful silver bracers with
scrolling and runic sigils carved into it across
the band are present These would make a better
defensive capability for someone who does not
themselves partake in the use of armor
 Well that sounds like its meant to be
  gold pieces
 What
 Okay theyll be here waiting for you
 Thank you Thank you Thank you
Thank you
 I apologize didnt mean to send you into
an existential financial crisis But its a really
powerful enchantment and
 Fair enough Okay well Pumat Prime worked
very hard on those When you come back to get them
I think youll be very happy with amount that
youve spent to keep yourself alive
 Ill go ahead and bring it up with the big
guy himself
 Fantastic
 Yeah Okay thank you
 You guys hastily make your way to the cart
 The rest of you guys gather the carts and
the horses you have at your disposal Prepared
yourself for exit from the town Eventually Caleb
and Beauregard catch up to the rest of you What
would you like to do
 Roll for kitty biscuits
 The Bromkiln yeah The Bronchial Byway the
life breath of the land
 I enjoy it and Im sure every Dungeon
Master out there who watches knows exactly how I
feel when it happens You gather your things up
into the cart the horses begin to push off and
you make your way through the city streets of
Zadash to the Northern Wall You can still see
some of the townsfolk coming out and going about
their day but the general air of tension and
nervousness still holds court throughout the
citys streets There are clusters of crownsguard
Theyre escorting the Righteous Brand to the
eastern side You make your way to the northern
side of the city where the Signet Wall district
begins where you have the large fortresses where
the military stays and the barracks that surround
that region To the large gate that exits the
building out into the rest of the Marrow
Valley As you make it through the large raised
portcullis along with a few other folks that are
in the process of making their own journey into
the north or to the west or to the east you step
out onto the dirt road into the green blowing
fields the cold breeze thats blowing beneath the
graying skies of Wildemount and you push off
Being here for a while it seems strange but also
welcoming to be back on the open road for a
moment You glance around and take a deep breath
as that clean postrain air still seems to linger
in the vicinity As you make a sweep on the
horizon with the rolling hills and patches of
trees catch your vision off to the far east on
the outside of the Signet Wall district you see
hundreds if not thousands of soldiers all
gathered and making their way east in small
troops Here the mainstay source the bulk of
military power in the center of the Empire makes
its way to war You see horses siege engines and
large ballista on wheels all being carried and
prepared for the journey to the borders of Xhorhas
and beyond With that you pick up and continue
northward making your way long the Amber Road
towards to where the Bromkiln Byway carves off to
what pace are you travelling at You can go slow
pace if you try to be super stealthy Normal pace
is fine Fast pace you go quickly but you
threaten exhaustion if you continue to push that
way
 Youre looking at about a mile journey
With the cart and the horses youre looking at
about  miles a day at a normal pace Youre
probably looking at two nights stay on the road
before you reach your destination
 You guys push forward and watch as behind
you the large looming walls and towers and
buildings of Zadash that had been your home for
weeks disappear slowly behind you Once again
youre embraced by the wilds and open landscapes
of the valley You take a moment to reflect upon
the insanity and craziness of the urban atmosphere
and the peace as well as the unknown that comes
with traversing such an open plain Id say you
have maybe a few hours before the sun sets Right
as you hit the intersection between the Amber Road
and the Bromkiln Byway the sun has set The sky
is dark the clouds prevent starlight from coming
through and what moonlight would be visible is
choked giving you only the faint glimmer of the
moons location behind the cloud cover
What would you like to do
 It is
 At your current location Make a perception
check with disadvantage because it is nighttime
 Then you can both make individual rolls or
one of you can aid the other
 You take your advantage on your roll
 As the night has fallen and you spend the
better part of the next hour trying to look for
any physical representation of safety or cover it
is just open rolling hills and field There might
be places where you could stay low and perhaps
keep relatively safe but nothing that sticks out
to you unfortunately What do you plan to do
 Which is a good thing because it gets cold
at night out here
 Itll only get colder the further north you
go Even at night here most mornings in
Wildemount at least this area of Wildemount all
the grass is frosted the windows are frosted Few
moisture survives the evening without some sort of
frozen state As the temperature begins to plummet
continuously after sunset you begin to find a
place to set up camp for the evening Beau takes
the torch ignites it and sets a small fire You
begin to set up a small circle and maintain warmth
by taking what bits of and its very sparse
vegetation If you want to check for anything to
keep the fire going roll a survival check
 You manage to get some brush gathered
youre probably not going to be able to keep the
fire going all night
 Lets say if you throw in three torches
thatll keep a modicum of the flame going through
the night Not the most heat but itll be enough
to prevent you from dealing with the biting cold
as you rest through the night
 Whos taking watch
 As the rest of you manage to find yourself
asleep for the evening Jester and Fjord take the
first watch Do you wish to make a perception
check
 Which one of you is helming
 Advantage
 Keeping an eye out there other than a
couple bits of whistling wind that blow through in
segments you dont pick up anything shifty and
your watch comes to a close without issue
 Next watch
 Whos helming perception check on this
 So youre aiding Technically because its
night it would be a straight roll
 The goggles are only a radius This is a
general awareness so its just a single roll
Youre helping her to maintain
 Keeping your senses around you and looking
about the watch seems to go through uneventful
 I know
 With that your watch comes uneventful
 Third and final watch
 Nott and Molly Whos helming this one
 Advantage on yours Actually it would have
been the first one I started to realize its
advantage but disadvantage because its night
 As you guys get part way through your watch
conversing muttering about the recent events the
sun comes up uneventful
  Letsa go  With that
morning comes Without the necessary heat the
fire the torch goes out and right as the frost
begins to cause you to shake yourself awake the
morning comes melting the dew and you are
prepped up on your cart and ready for the next
length of your journey
 If you wish to see if shes telling the
truth roll an insight check
 Shes hard to read She seems honest and
forthright in what shes saying
 Whos helming watch as you guys are
traveling
 Make a perception check for me
 Thats enough As you guys are continuing
about midday or so youre hitting the noonday
sun and some of the clouds have broken up
briefly You notice a tiny distant curl of smoke
over one of the hills Just a lazy little line of
darkness across the
 It looks very localized
 You cannot see Its over one of the larger
hills thats blocking what its source is Its
about a mile or so off of the road if you were to
go ahead in that direction
 It could be It could be chimney smoke Its
not a billowing column
 Continuing onward about ten minutes later
you get just around the edge of where that hill
was and you can see the source of the smoke
There nestled between a small cluster of trees
and a bit of natural rock formations a small
shack that the smoke is coming from
 Continue going forward on the road
 Yeah its about a mile away
 Yashas going to the shack Is it just
Yasha
 Okay so Yasha Molly and Fjord are heading
to the shack
 As you guys make your way up cresting the
hill down into this small localized valley
toward where the shack is with the clusters of
trees and the edge of a small forest cluster is a
little bit past it You approach the shack and as
you get towards it you get a better look at it
Its made of simple masonry and stones lodged
together to create the outer walls of it It cant
be more than  feet by  feet in size Its not
a large abode There is one brick chimney where
that single curl of smoke that was visible off
your end was there theres a wood chopping block
on the outside with an axe embedded and left in it
with couple of pieces of firewood off to the side
Theres a tanning easel set there for whoever has
been utilizing it There is a front door You see
a window that has no glass in it Its maybe that
big or so its more for keeping an eye out or
looking through it
 Perception check
 Looks fine
 You get off the horse
 This soft paw starts tapping you in the
face
 Command right
 You still blow and the fur gets in your
nose Fjord you head around back In the back
theres a couple of cured and salted meats that
are hanging from the back of the ramshackled roof
that ends and curves down a bit Over time the
weathering has caused it to curl under There is
another doorway that leads in the back It looks
like there is no window back here There is a
single window out front and there are two doors
in the front and back of it
 You hear a little bit of rustling a couple
heavy footsteps You hear a large metal rod shift
and it creaks open about two to three inches
There you see what I can only describe as an
elderly fullblood orc His head wreathed and
tangled grey coarse hair like a crown around the
top of the head that goes past the mouth and over
the chest to about midpoint there A footlong
beard around his chin that ends at about the
bottom of the clavicle or the sternum Muscular
and hunched his graygreen skin looks thick and
weathered and folded crows nests under where the
nose and the mouth is the two heavy tusks
protruding from underneath the lower jaw His eyes
are sunken and bloodshot around the side of the
yellow sclera One hand opens the door while
another one remains out of sight As the face
pushes forward to inspect you a low voice says
Your business
 Everything is fine
 Have you news to share
 Good to know The door begins to close
 Leans further in
 Make a charisma check
 Okay all right
 Glaring at you with one eye peeking through
Theres a bit of a grunt and the breath emanates
and it smells of heavy pepper and dust A bit of
smokiness to it The door opens slightly more and
the head peeks through to give you a good look
over Maybe for trade
 What do you have to trade
 Reaches out and
 Gold doesnt hurt other passersby
 Tools are helpful
 Vegetables Fresh produce maybe
 He opens the door a bit further and looks to
the left He looks to the right Youre off to the
side of the wall though so you dont see him and
he doesnt see you He goes Come in and opens
the door fully and steps back You can now see he
had in the other hand a really nastylooking
somewhat rusted battleaxe that he had right around
the door just in case He goes and sets the loop
of the handle of it and puts it over a knob thats
in the wall and then steps inside his small hovel
as you look in the inside Its fairly bare but
there are lots of furs that have been skinned and
cured that are up on the walls that are hanging
from wolves from badgers different other
creatures that hes probably hunted and brought in
here for the tanning process You see hanging on
the edge a handmade piece of hide armor that has
been recently stained and as soon as you get
close you can smell the stained scent off of it
You get the sense here based on the tanning stuff
set up outside that thats probably part of his
trading business
 Its also for trade or purchase Also I
have meats I have pelts
 He thinks to himself for a second and
considers the time and energy hes put into it
Handmade  gold pieces
 I give you two pounds of meat
 He coughs a bit goes over and starts
grabbing the armor and pulling it off of the knob
and setting it down grabbing some meat He opens
the back door and steps out and starts pulling it
off of some of the racks of nails on there
 Yeah Youre staying where you are
 Okay Make a perception check
 Ten Okay He grabs the meats sets them in
a small sack ties it up hands it over The armor
he preps and folds and sets over hands it to
you
 Im aware
 Good luck He closes the door You hear

 You guys mount back up on your horses and
make your way back to the rest of the group on the cart
 Its hide armor
 Its wellmade handcrafted hide armor for
anybody who would have use for it whether it be
using or reselling it Thats up to you
 You guys continue onward for the rest of the
day until eventually the sun sets and you find
yourselves with evening quickly taking the sky
 Whos helming the search for a good place to
camp
 Perception check with advantage because the
sun is still up
 So he got advantage
 You glance off and maybe about  minutes
up the road you can see a small forest maybe two
or three miles in diameter Its a cluster of
trees and would probably be a way
to camp off of the road
 Make a nature check
 It is meat
 Its good Its a little dry but its
salted Its cured Itll keep for a while
A little chewy
 Make a nature check
 Its good
 Yeah you can do that You manage to set up
right as the sun completes setting You build up
this little campfire in the center You set up
your bedding around it The cart is a little ways
off Unless youre putting the bedding in the cart
and putting that there next to it Okay You put
the cart there
 Thread around the edges Okay Whos taking
first watch
 Roll a normal roll because you are keeping
an eye through darkness
 Night vision is only out to a certain
radius
 You both maintain the first watch as you
continue looking out towards the darkness beyond
the visible trees that are refracting what little
bit of light makes it to their bark Looking into
the shadows your watch comes to an end
uneventful
 Make an investigation check
 It takes you a little while You start
getting a little nervous because Yasha just
vanishes in the darkness saying Ill be right
back and is gone for like  minutes
 You do come back with a handful of small
posies Theyre nothing special but theyre flowers
 You guys finish your watch Whos taking the
next watch
 All right Nott and Caleb Whos taking
point on this
 Go ahead and roll
 This would be a straight roll for you
 The lanterns theyre helping you see the
close vicinity
 Ill say sure How far can the lights go
out Whats the range
 Yeah so roll with advantage
  Nice You guys are sitting there for a
bit enjoying the time by the fire conversing
Caleb youre keeping an eye out beyond the
various tree trunks You hear the snapping of a
twig and you see some shifting of shadow
 A few things
 As you glance around and hes pointing this
out and you begin to come to consciousness
 At that moment as soon as you finish
casting Mage Armor theres a little flash of
arcane energy and two arrows come shooting out of
the shadows right towards you Natural  and a
six which would bring it to ten
 All right You suffer five points of
piercing damage as the arrow catches you right in
the left pectoral muscle and I need you to make a
constitution saving throw
 You feel this burst of poison begin to pulse
through your veins You are considered poisoned
As you guys all see this happen you glance around
and you can see a bunch of small shapes beginning
to skitter from around some of the trees This
growling sound almost barking sound Theres a
few strange furred wolves emerging from one side
two or three of them their eyes glistening as the
light from the fire manages to catch it from an
angle Behind them these two heavy forms begin to
emerge and one of them goes Oh no Theyve
awakened Gonah I know Emmett And well come
back to roll initiative here as were going to
take a quick break

Congrats to you my friend Exactly I guess I
should bring out the map
 Glancing around you see a cluster of
goblinlike creatures coming out of the nearby
forest helmed by two large ogres that are yelling
across the way
 It is very shadowy and dark You cant even
see A cluster of wolves also are circling from
that side
 I did not have the cart and horses with me
I thought I did and I left them at home Well say
that they got spooked after the arrows were fired
and are off the side of it
 To that note everyone I need you to roll
initiative
Oh my god
 Oh shit
 I  Okay All right to
  to 
  to ten
 Wow Ten to five
 Jester and Yasha at the same time Top of
the combat round after the arrows were fired and
Caleb is wincing and pulling back from the blow
As these creatures begin to come out of the
shadows preparing for their continuation of their
assault Beau youre up first
 Youre right there Caleb nudged you awake
 Looking this way as he nudged you you see the
wolves these goblin creatures here and this
large looming ogre that was shouting across the
way to the other ogre whos now pushing past the
tree and coming into view
 As you dart past itll put you right
there
 As you rush up grabbing your staff from the
ground getting the sleep from your face you run
towards it Swing
 Ten misses
 Both first strikes attack Thats your
attack action
 You swing twice Youre still groggy from
being woken up and your blows go a bit wide The
ogre laughs as it palms away one of your strikes
 As you get into a stance you look down and
theres the wolf growling its jaws open its
teeth exposed
 The goblins are taking their turn now I
rolled really high on their initiative
 They are goblins as now youve gotten a
moment to look You see them in their greenish
skin Theyre wearing bits of cobbledtogether
leather and hide and pelts of whatever theyve
scavenged around They have bits of red and purple
paint smeared on their face in some war paint
style Theyre all like  You
speaking Goblin know that theyre essentially
shouting commands Dont engage Pull back and
fire Theyre all keeping their distance at this
point this close up to fire theyre starting to
back away and rotate firing volleys of arrows
again towards everybody in the center Thats
going to be two against Caleb one against Nott
two against Yasha two against Jester and two
against Fjord Actually it should be only one
against Fjord because theres only eight goblins
Yeah so two against Caleb Thats cocked Thats
going to be a 
 And a six
 Okay both miss Both deflecting off of the
Mage Armor you put up before
 Thats going to be one against Nott Its
going to be an eight
 You duck out of the way and it goes
vanishing into the darkness beyond Thats going
to be two against Yasha Thats going to be a
nine And a 
 You take four points of piercing damage and
you need to make a constitution saving throw
 Four points of piercing damage and make a
constitution saving throw
  The arrow hits you and you feel the
poison pulse through You flex and grit your
teeth and your body manages to prevent the poison
from taking root into your system
 Thats going to be two to Jester Thats
going to be a  And a 
 Thats five points of piercing damage to
you Make a constitution saving throw
 Natural  You manage to shrug off the
venom of these arrow strikes One against you Fjord
Thats going to be a 
 Misses As you have your shield now
 You did You took five points of piercing
damage Just splinters across it With that they
all begin to dart back behind cover This one
vanishes over here This ones going to dart over
to this space there This darts behind here They
both vanish behind the tree there They all just
dash into the shadows and vanish behind the
various trees around you That finishes the round
Caleb youre up with Fjord on deck
 All righty
 Wisdom save
  is the DC All right For that ogre over
there thats a failure Hes going to be slow
 All right Then the other goblins there
Thats an  It succeeds That one there Thats
another  Two in a row Sorry about that
 Right there
 All righty You are maintaining Slow
concentration on him
 No hes just poisoned
 That being the case that finishes up
Calebs turn Fjord youre up with Molly on deck
 As you suddenly watch him already a
sluggish creature moving at an even more sluggish
pace the shadows around all of a sudden jump
off of the nearby tree trunks and cling to the
interior of its form around where the nooks and
crannies are Almost like a smallscale Venom
symbiote at times
 Southeast Around this way or this way
 Okay Thats ten   
 You do get past this guy who does get
an attack of opportunity on you if youd like
 Okay Five Ten    
 Thats where you get there
 Right there As you rush past you spin
around with the sword and shield in one hand I
mean you havent drawn your falchion yet
 Yeah so you just spin around releasing
from your grip
 You do One attack for each
 That does not hit
 The second one hits The first one the
goblin has a shield affixed to its wall and it
knocks it out of the way The Eldritch Blast just
poofs without any sort of impact The second one
does hit the other it poops
 The other goblin goes flying back about five
or six feet tumbles to the ground and is not
moving
 Finishing Fjords turn Molly youre up
 You do Is this with your Rite of the Dawn
 The scimitar gleams with this faint
glowing radiant energy this luminescent glow to
the blade as he swings towards the singular
goblin Make your attacks if youd like
  hits
 Yep
 Correct
  points of damage Thatll do it You rush
up and carve right through his torso
 You do
 Thats   You can get right up
behind with that goblin
 Go for it
 As you swing towards it it manages to take
a shield and deflect the blade and your scimitar
sticks into the side of the tree and you have to
pull it forth and dislodge and prepare yourself
for the next round
 That finishes Mollys go Now the ogres
take their turn This one right here next to
Beau as you charged up and attempted to pummel
it go in a defensive stance  Hes going
to make two greatclub swings towards you with
disadvantage because you have your Even with
disadvantage that is a  to hit I rolled a 
and a 
 That hits The second one that is an  and
a 
 The second one misses The first one as it
swings down towards you with heavy aggression
That is  points of bludgeoning damage as it
slams into you and you hit up against the tree As
you barely catch yourself and right the second
swing goes through and with that you manage to
pull underneath your defensive stance ready to
go and you jam the club into the tree The tree
actually shakes sending a bunch of leaves and a
couple of birds scatter out from the inside as the
ogre pulls the club back
 Correct With that the ogre goes ahead
and Actually hes just going to move over here
and is going to shout at the dogs Go Carve
face The dogs get ready to pounce
 Ogre only has  feet of movement
 Yep
 Yeah Hes like  confused
grumbles Not within distance however pulls a
javelin out of a small pouch on the side and right
there in immediate view is the tiny goblin that
at the moment the ogre thinks might be one of his
own Instead is going to assault the mage that
affected him with the Slow spell and still
throwing it slowly it goes in your direction
Its the only action it takes though
 That is going to be a  to hit Natural

 Thats the javelin which does pained
inhale
  points of piercing damage The javelin
sinks into your stomach and embeds itself about
four or five inches into your torso to the point
where the javelins now holding itself out from
your body You immediately grab it and the shock
hits you that it managed to drive itself so deep
inside You arent even aware of the damage its
done to your internals its put you in a state of
shock Thats going to end that guys turn but it
gets to make a saving throw to try and resist the
Slow spell That is going to be 
 Your spell DC is  yeah It rolled a
natural  minus two Not very wise these guys
so he remains slow However I need you to make a
concentration check
 Its a constitution saving throw
 You manage to maintain your Slow spell on
him no issue The ogres turns are done Nott
youre up
 Over this side
 All right  
 Okay
 It is Essentially because youre aiming
for such a small piece there I was going to add
five to the armor class but a natural  hits As
hes pulled back and clutching himself you hit
the book thats harnessed under his arm You feel
the impact nope
 You fall prone on the ground I will ask you
to make another concentration check because you
are averting your gaze and attention from the
creature you are focusing on
 Ten Youre fine Ten is the DC you had to
hit
 Yeah just out of the corner of his eye
 I do need you to make a deception check but
with advantage because you managed to pull this
off pretty well so far This is just to convince
others
  As far as theyre concerned Caleb is
dead
 Well in order to do the bonus action
strike you have to have attacked with your
action Its either two attacks or something
else
 You have a bonus action yes
 Ill say sure
 Make a deception check
 Yeah I know
  okay
 This would be deception
 Okay They look at you confused One of
them looks over towards the horses The other one
seems to be holding his ground but it looks like
one of them is in the moment of looking off to
something else That ends your turn Jester and
Yasha you guys are up
 Yeah As far as you guys know Nott just
turned on you with the rest of the goblins and
shot down Caleb
 Okay there you go You move over stepping
over the campfire
 You heal  hit points Caleb Do you
continue to play dead
 Okay The spell doesnt have an effect on
Caleb
 Sacred Flame is an action though isnt it
 Thats okay
 You can move You still have like  feet of
movement
 At half movement you grab and start
dragging Caleb face down through the dirt to about
there is as far as you can get him through rocks
and sticks Twigs and shit are getting caught in
your hair
 Yeah
 That finishes Jesters turn Yasha what are
you doing
 To this guy
 You step forward past there and you get
right up into the grill of the slowed ogre
 As you guys watch here the campfire
suddenly dims The flames flicker and cool to this
low orange glow from the vibrant yellow flame it
was before as Yasha steps past the flame Behind
the shawl two large skeletal black wings emerge
from the back of her shoulder blades
 It has that effect but its still visible
Im pretty sure
 The effect is only within ten feet
 You look at a somewhat translucent skeletal
wing structure with membranous undeadlooking wings
 As that happens this dark energy emanates
from her body and for a second the white tips of
her hair go completely black As she steps
forward striding with her blade in her hands
 Currently Nott youre the only one who can
see this but her eyes go jet black Entirely full
darkness a void of light where her eyes once were
as this happens and she strides forward Charisma
saving throw on his point there
 Well youre more than ten feet
Unfortunately he does succeed However you do
manage to maintain the rest of your ability
 Yep you have two attacks Oh no this is
an action to do that so no you cannot attack
this round
 No because you get two attacks for the
attack action But thats your action
 Yes you may As you step up to this ogre
your wings unfurled you give out this heavy Yasha
roar that echoes in the space around you as your
wings flex out even further This dark energy
pulling in and the ogres like confused
grunts looking taken aback by this unexpected
display of power
 Going to have to look into that Is that
your turn Yasha
 All right it is the wolves turn
 There are three wolves These wolves here
watching you drag Caleb backward all rush in to
charge against you
 No because they moved outside of your range
there
 This one does
 You get one attack of opportunity against
that guy Go ahead and roll for it If you hit him
he gets Thats cocked
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 He doesnt get to move
  damage
 As the wolf rushes from you you crack down
with the staff It yelps Its still standing but
its hurt really bad Its limping and turns
around towards you with this heavy growl this
angry glare at you Its going to attempt to
attack you with disadvantage because youre still
in your  and a  plus four thats going to
be
 Im rolling really good yeah I know Its
almost like I have a dice that lets me do that
 And double fours on the ds That will be
ten points of piercing damage and I need you to
make a strength saving throw
 Yes
  okay It does not knock you prone As it
strikes you it attempts to push you off your
feet and you resist it using your hand against
the tree to push yourself back up and get back
into position
 The two other ones however are going to go
against Jester and because they have Pack
Tactics they both have advantage on their strikes
against you because theyre coming at you from
flanking you as a wolf First one is going to
be
 A  on the first one Not a natural 
 No Thats going to be double s on that
one Jesus Christ Im rolling really good
tonight Both hit you
 I am Im excited The first one is going to
be eight points of piercing damage and the other
one is going to be nine points of piercing damage
I need you to make two strength saving throws
 Yes
 Yes two of them please
 You manage to resist being knocked prone as
they both begin jumping at you and clawing One of
them bites towards the back of your armor You
throw it to the ground You almost get knocked
off but you kept yourself there between the two
of them standing Caleb at your feet
 Hes going to attempt to make a dexterity
saving throw Thats a natural four nope Thats
full damage on this wolf here
  points of damage That wolf suddenly is
blasted in freezing cold energy as you yell in
response to its assault
 As you pull back and look the wolf is
frozen solid and tumbles into a bunch of ice
chunks Off the battlefield That ends the wolfs
 Go for it
 Yep
 That misses The first one hits
 Six points of damage
 So you have two more strikes Against the
ogre as well
  hits
  also hits Roll damage on both of those
ds on those
 Nice  points of damage on it That
finishes Beaus turn It is now the goblins go
 You come after the goblins dont worry
Youre coming This one here whos up against
you Molly is going to throw the shortbow over
its shoulder pull out its scimitar and lash out
towards you Thats going to be a  to hit
 That hits then You suffer five points of
slashing damage It strikes across you backs up
pulls its shield up and is getting ready to
defend itself from whatever assault you bring back
at it Its going to stay right there because
its liking the tree cover to its side but
keeping an eye over its shoulder to Fjord who
tried to fire at it previously These two goblins
are going to step out and theyre going to both
fire at Fjord who is advancing towards them That
is going to be a  to hit
 And a ten to hit
 You resist the poison no issue This one is
going to use the rest of its movement to dart
behind there This ones going to move behind
there These two here that are along with Nott are
going to ignore Nott This one is going to start
moving this way towards where the cart ran off
and its off the grid there This one is going to
saunter up right next to Nott and make a shot at
Yasha Thats a natural  so its going to be 
to hit You are raging though so you take half
damage Which is good thatd be seven points of
piercing damage reduced to three so you take
three points of piercing damage You do have to
make a constitution saving throw All of the
arrows they have are dipped in some sort of a
toxin or venom
 It poisons They get the poisoned
condition
 With that even in your form the poison
begins to take hold and where the wound catches
you off the side of the throat and the back of the
head the veins begin to pulse black as the poison
begins to take hold You are poisoned
 You dont take any additional damage but
currently all of your attacks are at
disadvantage
 It does actually
 Poisoned
 Disadvantage on attack rolls and
ability checks
 Its pretty rough That ends that guys
turn Theres one goblin back here Seeing that
Molly is currently engaged its going to rush up
behind and attempt to flank the back of him Its
going to make a strike with its scimitar with
advantage because its flanking you Thats
cocked Even its highest roll there is a seven
plus four thats  It goes to strike and you
see it coming hearing the little footsteps behind
you you duck out of the way as it strikes
hitting air and now youre holding them off on
both sides I think thats all of them that have
gone so that is going to lead us to Caleb
 Correct
 To get these two here
 Go ahead and roll the points for sleep Its
not concentration so you get to maintain Slow
 foot radius
 The foot radius sphere
  hit points total This one falls
unconscious that one stays up
 Ten foot radius then That would be there
Half the size
 Fjord youre up
 Five ten  
 All right go for it
 As you draw your falchion out of the side
you focus on it and as you do so this spark of
electrical thunder energy engulfs the edge of it
as you strike downward
 That hits roll damage
 An additional d
  point of damage With that as you cut
down into the goblin the blade sinks in partway
through the torso and then the burst causes it to
tear apart in two different directions exploding
spattering across the tree and the side of the
ogre thats ten feet in front of you Doesnt seem
to notice
 No its an action to use the cantrip then
you get an attack as part of it so you have to
decide between doing two attacks with your
invocation that you took or
 Your movement
 Youre not quite flanking you have to get
one more square to be flanking with Yasha but
Yasha can possibly move and make that flanking on
your turn if youd like
That ends Fjords turn Molly youre up
  hits that works
 Eight points of damage As you carve
through it cuts a giant gash down the front of
its body to part of its thigh Its wounded very
badly but still standing
 Carved that goblin right there
 Thatll hit
 What you do is you strike once and it
sticks into his body then as hes still living
you double down push and force it the rest of the
way down carving it in half and it splits in
half and is destroyed
 Striking down overhand towards it behind
you
 Total of 
 Does not hit Hes ready for you and the
shield catches your blade It sticks into it for a
second and shoves it off with you
 I forgot to attack with that other ogre last
turn but thats okay He was slowed its fine
Now the ogres go This one is going to continue to
pummel you as now youve pummeled it so it gets
two strikes against you
 Thats going to put him at a nine so the
first strike misses Are you going full amplified
The second strike also has disadvantage
 Thats going to be a 
 Both swings go wide as its eyes suddenly are
filled with blackened blood and it cant see
where you are It hits the side of the tree and
the tree actually tumbles over onto the ground there
 The other ogre whos now in front of Yasha
as you approached it its caught off guard
Smash scary thing Its going to take two
strikes towards you
 Yeah It was one action as multiattack
 Thats going to be a  Whats your armor
class
 Thats going to be a  Second one misses
but the first one does hit That is  points of
bludgeoning damage halved to eight Its still
 its like its trying to push through
molasses every time it strikes or swings at you
Its going to attempt to shift around not even
noticing Fjord there at the moment around this
way Fjord you do get an attack of opportunity
against it
 That hits Roll damage
 It is not It is considered technically a
giant
 Nice That finishes your reaction on that
Ogres turn is done Nott youre up
 Okay
 That hits Ogre is a big target
 You do
 Ooh nice As its looming around it gets
struck by Fjord as its trying to stomp around
Yasha trying to pull away from that situation
You shoot towards the base of its skull and it
sticks in and the left arm for a second goes numb
and it has to flex its muscle to snap the bolt in
its neck leaving part of it still lodged in the
base of its skull but at least now its got the
use of its other arm back and goes to clutch onto
the club still moving slowly and sluggish with
every movement
 Thats your action
 Okay

 As you do so it was literally holding the
shield in front of it and you just shoot the
shield 
 That finishes your turn Nott
 All right That finishes your turn That
brings us to Jester and Yasha Jester
 Wisdom save for him Thats going to be
 Right dex Its a 
 Roll damage
 Oh shit
 Where do you want to place it
 There you go Roll for a strike on that
wolf
  hits
 Nine points of damage to the wolf It clubs
down  You watch as one of the shoulders
breaks Its barely standing Its like

 Does that finish your turn
 Up to you What do you want to do
 Okay Yasha what are you doing
 You have disadvantage because you are
poisoned still
 Youre raging but you have to roll twice
and take the lower unless you do reckless in
which case it will balance it
 What was that first one The first attack
  hits Second one is
  still hits Its a big target Its AC is
lower because of the Slow spell Hes like
supereasy to hit His armor class is effectively
nine right now
 Thats true
  for the first hit How do you want to do
this

 As you pull him over the blade it pushes up
into the clavicle and up into the throat It
emerges actually knocking your bolt out of the
body because the blade managed to shove it outside
of it and as it slowly gurgles to the ground and
collapses the Hex is gone the Slow is gone and
the ogre is gone
 I know I hit my sleeve Its all good I
got it
 Yeah magnets
 Whats wrong with that You have another
attack if you want to move and attack something else
 Oh easily You saunter up aside from Beau
Beau as youre pummeling you look over your
shoulder and have Yasha arrive eyes black giant
skeletal wings
 Fear effect only happens when you initiate
it Its not
 Correct d Plus five You do get to deal
extra necrotic damage to it equal to your level
Because of your transformation
 An additional five damage to this
  points of damage
 That finishes your turn
 Theyve been beaten around quite heavily at
this point and it looks like some of them may
have been previously wounded from something else
You have carved a giant chunk out of its torso
That finishes your turn The wolves go One of
them is still asleep The other one thats
currently being harried by three of you is going
to attempt to strike ah damn it There we go
Lollipop Its going to attempt to strike at you
Nope thats a 
 At this point that finishes the wolfs
turn The other one is sleeping unconscious Top
of the round Beau youre up
 Five damage
 That hits roll damage
   You actually jam it in
part of the giant wound Part of its muscle is
flopping over from where Yasha had struck him
 All right Two strikes
 Hits
 All right Seven and six Nice
 Youre pummeling its torso and its belly is

 That ends Beaus go Its now the goblins
turn Yeah Theyre going to flee This ones just
running
 You dont have a melee weapon ready Because
you have your crossbow out
 Yeah it doesnt work that way
 Sure Ill let you do that
 Strength bonus not dexterity
 Okay that hits Go ahead and roll damage
 One damage plus your strength modifier
 Whats your strength modifier
 You do one point of damage to it as you
slug it in the back of the head it runs off the
board in this direction This one is going to run
this way
 Yes you do Go for it
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Five points of damage You strike past it
It keeps running charges this direction The ogre
right now being surrounded and watching the rest
of its fellows run away is backing up and
looking Where Emmett Oh yeah thank you Hes
blocked from my position He is going to seeing
everything else fleeing scatter as well Just
runs off the map That finishes their go Caleb
youre up
 Okay Youre casting it at level two
 Yeah so its two missiles each Go ahead

 He gets hit by both continues to run Hes
wounded but still alive
 Seven for this one The one thats running

different sides and his head pops open from both
sides of the force damage hitting it Its body
runs for like three more steps before it 
onto the ground on its own
 Okay finishing Calebs go Fjord youre
up Molly youre on deck
 Okay You have your sword in your hand and
the shield
 Okay so you drop the sword Cast Hex to
strike this fellow
 Go for it
 That hits
 Hits Roll damage for each
 Do that twice because you hit it twice
  points of damage
 How do you want to do this

 Okay Beaus been pummeling it Yasha carved
into it its looking like its ready to flee As
it turns around this way it sees this flash of
greenish light out of the corner of its eye looks
back They both impact right in the chest outside
of its shoulder blades in the back two blasts of
crimson leaving these two smoking holes in its
chest that you can partially see through and it
falls back knocking this tree over in the
process The rest the surviving goblins have
seemingly scattered leaving you in the
battlefield with one wolf that is unconscious

 That finishes Fjords go
 Molly youre up
 Go for it
 Yeah roll some damage
 The wolf is misted
 You get right up next to Beau and thats the
extent of it there That ends your turn Molly
Ogres are done Nott youre up
 You start giving chase
 You run you see him You get up to this
point and you can see where he is
 Hes  feet away from you Hes right where
he is essentially and you got that far Hes 
feet from you
 Go for it
 Yeah that hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Mmhmm
 Seven points of damage to him All right he
has seven from him
 Yeah magic missile Yeah thats enough
 You release the crossbow It falls to the
ground breathing hard and tries to stand up
falls down to its knee again and then collapses
on the ground no longer moving
 Nope not at the moment
 Okay You move up to it Well get to that
next round For the narrative purposes of this
nothing is currently engaging you in combat The
wolf that is on deaths door is currently
unconscious and bleeding out from the spell that
you gave it
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because it is dark and at night
 Nah hes gone It darted off One survivor
made it
For the purposes of ease here youve
managed to finish off the wolf thats currently
unconscious really quickly Molly youre
standing next to it and its on the ground
 You had the bonus action because you didnt
use it Youre going to run up and put it out of
its misery You guys gather at this point and
with your wounds the poison still  in
your veins for both you and Caleb Around the
corner you see theres the horse cart about 
to  feet from where you are and theres one
goblin grabbing a bunch of sacks Hes like
 He turns around and sees all of
you standing there in the clearing and goes
 He goes into a full sprint in the opposite
direction
 Roll damage Level one
 That is a  so I think it succeeds Its
unfortunate
  You watch him run These what would be
five missiles anime Gundamstyle The goblin
  Its harried repeatedly with
these missiles impacting him Its pretty rough
With that silence falls upon the field Your cart
regained and the goblin running off spooks the
horses a bit and they pull the cart another ten
feet or so but they eventually slow down
 At this point the wings fold and vanish
Her eyes come back to normal color The white tips
of her hair return
 You dont see anything You seem to be
relatively alone
 Its less a Xhorhasian language and more
one that youre not quite certain why you
understand it
 Make an investigation check
 You dont recognize them
 Short bows scimitars grungy some of them
coated with excrement and other things to make
them nasty when they carve through and infect
wounds
 Large greatclubs that are carved
 On some of the scimitars They look nasty
 No
 But there are a few pouches that havent
been spilled or utilized entirely of toxin
 With that investigation check you manage to
pull five vials of toxin unused Each one has a
single use on some sort of a weapon
 Yeah its middle of the night maybe one or
two in the morning
 Theres a crack of thunder The rain begins
to come down as one of the slowly encroaching
storms begins to pour down in the middle of the
night
 Taking the final watch Roll perception for
me if you dont mind
 Disadvantage for the darkness
 Sure
 What did you roll
 As you complete the final watch the rain
doesnt subside The flashes of lightning and the
rolling of thunder makes it a bit difficult but
the exhaustion of the previous battle manages to
combat that enough for those of you who want to
complete your evenings rest you do Until
eventually the glow of the mornings light brings
you all to consciousness once more The rain
reduces itself to a drizzle You gather your
materials do the best you can to warm up shaking
yourself in the cold damp morning Gather your
cart slowly head back towards the roadway and
continue your journey towards the Labenda Swamp
And thats where we will end tonights episode
 If I didnt have anything to do tomorrow If
I wasnt flying to Canada tomorrow I could keep
going
 Yeah
 I think you did
 He was too busy with his own Anyway thank

Nein after spending quite some time in the
central city of Zadash had found that war had made
its way to the Empire with the far eastern region
of Xhorhas and the Kryn dynasty Upon this
conflict you decided that perhaps it would be
best to leave the central urban environment You
decided to dodge a few opportunities brought to
you especially that by the Lawmaster of the city
and instead went and made a conversation with your
friend The Gentleman beneath the city in his
Underworks There he offered two possible work
opportunities in which you accepted both The
first of which is going to send you towards the
swamp town of Berleben to the northnortheast
Then from there head far northeast to Shadycreek
Run to converse with and retrieve an ally of his
he had not been able to do business with in a
while You gathered your materials got your wagon
and horses made your way northward on the
Bromkiln Byway toward the Labenda Swamp Along
that path you managed to encounter a shackliving
hermited orc of some unknown background Continuing
northward you slept in a cluster of trees where
you were ambushed by a wandering troupe of goblins
and ogres Upon escaping their clutches and
defeating most of them only one I believe got
free you gathered what information you could
Managing to keep out of the rain you slept
beneath your cart and awaited the next morning As
we come back in you all have had your long rest so if
you havent marked that in your character sheet
please do so
 No
 No that didnt happen As you come to the
cold morning greets you the low mist and fog seem
to still clutch the outer edges of the forest
trees beyond your peripheral You can just see the
dark shapes of the trunks against the obscured
gray The mist and dew that is gathered on the
grass and bits of vegetation near the base of the
floor where youve slept has turned to frost with
the cold night Most of you managed to complete
your rest uncomfortably but awake to chattering
teeth and the shaking of your body Except for
Jester
 The morning is yours What do you wish to
do
 Okay You are very drunk
 Its still filled with liquid I mean you
drank a lot and it still feels like halffull
 Eventually yes
 In a very Ren and Stimpy fashion Jester
begins jamming this stick into Notts gullet
before the brackish brown whiskey comes back up in
a mild spray against the nearby now damp dirt
and grass
 It would be
 If you move quickly you can probably get
there right around sunset
 Its not carefully and quietly quickly
 Molly up front keeping the horses on task
you guys pick up the pace and get back out of the
forest main cluster and onto the Bromkiln Byway
heading northnortheast once more
 Are you moving at the slowest pace
  I drive the cart at a medium pace
 Pressing forward what two are maintaining a
watch as you progress
 One of you is aiding the other Who is
helming the roll
 Its like MuadDib riding the sandworm
standing up
 For the first half of the day you continue
along the path It gets rough in places and at
one point one of the wheels slams into a rock You
have to double check and make sure it didnt take
any damage It seems to be okay
 For the first half of the day nothing
catches your eye in particular The mist has
burned off at this point and a bit of sunlight is
breaking through the clouds It seems the storm
from the evening before has passed You can see
now over the mostly gray cloud cover there are
breaks in it from this distance you can see these
visible beams of sunlight slowly coasting across
the grass fields as you see the heavy high grass
pushing and pulling with each burst of breeze that
makes its way across the valley Its very
beautiful here in the center of the Empire Its a
very relaxing ride though you know youre
bookending your travel with tension to stress so
youre taking this moment to appreciate what it is
the Empire protects and what the people within are
fighting for in the coming conflict Second half
if the day same people on watch
 Its true give those ankles a rest Whos
helming the roll
 Youre aiding Beau Roll with advantage
  all right Continuing your pace Beau as
youre watching out from a northnorthwestern
direction you see a dark shape come over one of
the hilltops wide and encompassing
 It seems to be A number of miles out of the
way almost on the horizon you can see this
series of rolling hills in that direction that
obscure what lies beyond that area You watch as
one of the hills goes dark on top like the
coloration gets covered in shade
 There are clouds in the sky especially at
this time of year its generally pretty cloudy
here in the Empire Youve seen breaks in the
clouds as youve traveled for most of the day its
been warmer than usual so its been a welcome
change of pace from what youre used to but this
is not characteristic of cloud cover as most
everything here has some level of shade
 There are bits of trees and clusters of
them nothing that would be considered a major forest
What you slept in the night before has probably
been the largest cluster youve seen in your
travel today so far This catches you
 Correct Best you can tell at this distance
 You both look out there and as you travel
for the next ten minutes or so you can see faint
glimmers in that moving shadow as a bit of
sunlight travels over it Its at that moment you
realize what this is Its a legion What was a
dark shadow appears to be hundreds and hundreds of
soldiers an army regiment that is shifting from
the northwestern side of the Empire to cross over
the byway heading east As you continue your pace
forward you get to a point where you may
intersect with their path if you continue or you
can slow down or speed up Its your choice
 With that  the horses begin to
pick up pace You all grab the sides of the cart
as it begins to whir and kick its way across the
street The horses galloping framing the two
different sides of the cart as you pick up speed
You come up over one of the hills and then down
another embankment As you curve around the side
theres a part where the grass has overgrown a
large majority of the road here but you coast
through the center
 Make a general animal handling check if you
dont mind Molly
 Okay
 As you hit that portion of the road youre
having a hard time steering the horses youre not
entirely familiar enough to pull on the rein of
multiple at a single time to get the shift and
movement They begin to careen a little bit off of
the path almost trying to hide into the grass
embankment which slows your movement down ever so
slightly before  one of the wheels
suddenly  It is now digging
into the ground
 The cart is now sitting at a backward angle
and its slowing down
 Its grinding to a halt
 Okay make an investigation check You go
and check It looks like some sort of heavy rock
that was hidden and obscured in the grass just
off the road had slammed into both wheels on the
left side The front one had bent the wood
splintered inward and the metallic rim on the
inside had bent inward The other one had
completely been pushed inward and knocked at the
angle its pretty wrecked
 Do any of you guys have tools to fix a
wagon
 What toolkits would you have at your
disposal
 Your background may have abilities that
could help you in this scenario as well
 Things that are helpful
 carpenters tools
possibly Thats kind of rough
 Anybody
 No
 As you guys are having this conversation
the regiment is coming up over a nearer hill and
its about half a mile off from you now As its
marching you can hear the distant rustling of
hundreds and hundreds of footfalls making their way
through the field
 It looks like theyre going to be probably
passing in front of you
 You rolled a  There is no natural paths
here its an open field There are areas where
the grass isnt quite as dense and there are some
spots where some of the dirt isnt as receptive to
grass You find patches of dry ground but there
are no paths that you notice leading out of this
space unfortunately
 You do Whats the space on Mending
 As you focus on the front wheel the one
that had just dented inward and the wood
splintered a bit that was barely keeping it up
the wheel rights itself The metal bends back into
place the wood splinters kick right in the
spokes are as if they were untouched
 Yeah one was partially damaged the other
one was pretty wrecked The other wheel
unfortunately has taken a fair amount of damage
from the impact and the lower half of it has
broken inward its splintered out and its bent
its way off of the axle Unfortunately its a bit
too big for the Mending cantrip to fix
 Its pretty wrecked You do have three
wheels which means you could try it
 Yasha curls up around the axle
 You probably have about ten minutes before
they cross over the byway
 Beauregard Caleb Molly and Jester you
guys notice breaking away from the regiment above
you see a cluster of horses heading in your
direction You are out in the open
 Okay
 
 Its high grass The grass off the road
where you guys are standing right now is for you
almost shoulderhigh
 Stealth check
 No youve been traveling for half a day
since you left so youve pretty much sobered up
 Five horses have now galloped up and slow to
a trot as they come up alongside loosely circling
the side of your cart in the direction of where
the legion is They approach they are all dressed
in Righteous Brand full armor helmets on blades
or bows slung across the shoulders One of them
approaches Hail
 Apologies Were going to be crossing the
road here shortly We may require your patience
and shifting
 Of course Just of curiosity where are you
headed
 Labenda I wouldnt wish it upon my worst
foe Well good luck I am Captain Maximilian from
Druvenlode
 Through the helmet you see a welltrimmed
bit of chin facial hair short comes from under
the lip No mustache but you cant see if it
continues to the rest of his face
 Druvenlode
 Im going to do a little hashmark every
time
 At the end of the campaign you look at my
side of the Wyrmwood table and its all these
horrible marks carved into the wood
 Well it seems that the forces of the
Empire are heading east to keep the rest of you
safe Let me see what we can do
 He turns the horse around and begins to head
on back three follow him while two stay in the
area Not close to you but holding down the fort
keeping an eye on the road and look behind
 They both do
 You very well may Make a sleight of hand
check
 None of you see this especially not him or
his horse
 Horses notice things
 The saddlebag flips open gingerly then
reaches in and a small pouch relatively heavy
slips out and makes its way over to you and into
your grasp
 You do It is filled with dry oats and
corn
 The captain has ridden off so one of the
two other people that are there you now look
within the armor One is male and one is female
and the female soldier turns to you She has a
tense stare and a broadshouldered look as she
turns in your direction Ive never been but I
hear its pretty shitty
 From what Ive heard at the very least
its not very comfortable but people seem to
like it and live there still Its one of the
older provinces in the empire that I know Not
for me
 Thats not really a question
unfortunately In times of war we go where were
needed Were needed to the east so that you dont
have to go and wade into the battlefield
yourselves
 This will be my eighth circle
 Ive not Im both terrified and eager You
know you daydream of glory and then who knows
once you get there But I get the sense that
youve seen your fair share of battle in your day
right Looks right towards Yasha this hulking
woman with a giant twohanded greatsword on her back
 At this point another series of clomping
catches up to you and you can see the captains
returned with two men who are in similar colors
as the Righteous Brand regiment but not in armor
They carry large packs on their side and you can
hear the jangling of metal implements inside One
of them has pieces of wood some strips They get
off the horse and at this the captain goes Right
theres the cart Do your business Were going
to do our best to help you get back to the road friends
 Of course The two gentlemen go over and
start giving each other commands Lift up
there One of them pulls it up
 By all means if you have the right
then Jesters now holding the whole cart up by
herself They get down pull the wheel off and
begin to bend it back into place One of them goes
through a small pack of various pieces of wood
some that appear to have been soaked and are somewhat
pliable Ends up replacing the broken wood
nailing it in place Just to be safe they take
some rope and tie it over the wheel very taut to try
and hold the bent wood This should get you at
least to town I cant guarantee it will last you
for a long journey but I recommend a replacement
once you get there
 Of course Come on They get back on their
horses and they ride back At this point the
regiment has now crossed over the road and you
can now see hundreds of soldiers going across the
Byway The captain gives a nod puts his helmet
back on Well I wish you all luck Stay safe and
I hope that if luck is kind to us well cross
paths again
 They turn around and they make their way
back up to the rest of the army About  minutes
or so it takes for the group of soldiers to
finally cross over the path
 Yeah it wasnt a huge army per se Not as
big as the one you saw leaving Zadash In total
it might have been maybe  soldiers
 Now that the way is opened your cart seems to
have been temporarily repaired You make your way your way
back onto the road and continue your heading
north
 Sure Ill say for the purposes of this
make a wisdom check
 There you go Because you were so close you
were able to see all of the points in which they
attempted to repair the wheel and now that theyve
closed the gap on what is currently cracked and on
the verge of collapsing if this fix wasnt
centered around it you manage to concentrate and
with that each one of the
 You watch as the wood refixes itself and
becomes a solid wheel
 With that the cart lurches forward You all
have to catch up real fast to scamper back onto
the cart as Molly has picked it up again You get
yourself back on the road and heading northward
 Keeping watch for the rest of the way
eventually the sun comes close to setting and you
havent quite gotten within visual range of the
swamp Youre coming to a relatively hilly portion of
the terrain and ahead most of the valley tends to
cruise upward where the hills are now cresting and
obscuring the horizon But the sun is setting so
you may be looking somewhere to camp unless you
want to push through the night
 Smash cut to Fjords grave
 As you continue up towards this particular
hillcrest there is a small patch of high bushes
in an older campsite There is a clearing of the
grass where its mostly rock and dirt with some
bits of dried brush Theres a rock formation
with a bit of charcoal and blackened ground where
a fireplace had previously been set
 You guys bring the cart off to the side set
up your evening arrangement light a small fire
there in that same rock circle Whos taking first
watch
 One of you make the watch roll with
advantage as the other is giving aid
 Nice In the vicinity as the dark night
takes over there is no moonlight it is very
dark But you do catch a flash in the distance
 And another
 You listen for a while and it is getting
closer
 You guys are out in the open yeah
 Not unless any of you have it within your pack
but otherwise all you have is your cart
 Youre in the middle of a field right now
Its hilly terrain and the topography shifts a
bit but right now all you see is darkness beyond
your immediate darkvision peripheral
 The occasional flash of light you see in the
distance begins to frame an ominous shape far to
you have been able to see previously or hadnt
paid attention with the darkening sky
 And it does Those who are taking the first
part of your evenings rest come to as the storm
begins to come over The weather gets colder you
feel the rain imminent within the next hour
 No these were lightning bolts in the
distance in the storm
 The rain begins to kick in your vicinity
 The fire begins to go out
 Okay the cloak you have is treated with
simple wax to try and resist most water Youll
probably be a bit soggy in the morning but its
doable
 Alcohol and beef jerky man
 The first watch goes beyond the rain without
incident Who is taking the second watch
 Well theres only been the first watch
 Okay I didnt hear that part So Caleb
and Jester whos keeping up Whos the point man
on that watch
 Make your check
 At this point its midnight so its pitch
black
 You keep watch throughout the area now
without the warm glow of the fire to give you a
good visual perspective All you can go by are the
distant flashes and sometimes close flashes of
lightning  A loud one hits probably
striking a tree no more than two or three miles
from where you are All of you get jostled awake
for a moment before getting yourself back to sleep
 If I could have everybody leave the table
except for Yasha please
 As much as everyone else is attempting and
jostling around to get rest through the nights
weather theres something comforting about the
sound of rolling thunder to you Always kind of
has been but more so in recent years As
unconsciousness comes to you what usually means
dreamless sleep Welcome to be dreamless because
not all dreams are good for you Not all memories
are good for you But as the dark takes you
theres a flash of light the sound of thunder
and theres a vision A memory of people all
around you but faced away People you know
people you grew up with all looking the opposite
direction It fades to dark Theres another flash
and youve pushed through them and you see an
elevated piece of ground in the central rock in
the shape of a figure but you cant see it Its
obscured by the low light You do know who that
shape is It goes to dark It stays dark for a
while to the point where you are longing for that
next vision clamoring for it You feel this
searing pain burning up each of your arms You
look down but can see nothing except for flames
curling up the side Dull bluish purple flames
that create the outline of your forearms It burns
up to the tips of your fingers Flash once more
and around you are bodies Creatures people
children monsters dozens and dozens of corpses
carved and torn asunder Where you saw the blue
flame up your arm you just see blood dripping
fresh crimson onto the ground The only sound you
hear Your vision fades to darkness once more
ruined statue The one beacon of nameless hope
that pulled you out of that darkness Missing part
of its torso the head mostly cleaved akilter
The land seemingly ejecting the presence of what
this statue represents Your eyes look down and
focus at the base and as the vision begins to fade
to black once more your eyes focus on that single
takes you once more The next flash 
hits and youre just walking Your lips are
parched Your muscles ache You look over your
shoulder and you see before you the memory of the
land where you grew up The waste beyond the
central swamp of Xhorhas But it is crawling with
thousands and thousands of worms From this
perspective it looks like its so small But for
these worms to be where they are they would be so
immense at this distance The perspective is
almost dizzying and you look away You glance up
back at that mountain and in spite of that pain
you continue to push The vision fades and this
time the darkness lingers Confusion wells in
the desperation for something Its not fair Its
not fair to be given just a few glimpses and no
opportunity no chance How do you make this
right What do you make right What did you do
What is there  One final loud
shattering shaking flash of light and rolling
thunder brings to you one singular vision of a
figure in the dark center of a storm cloud
swirling The wind buffets your shoulders with
freezing air You feel your hair being whipped and
thrown around your face stinging as it slaps
against your cheeks and eyes The same figure
that statue that had pulled you from the darkness
once before stands made of the same roaring and
roiling clouds and rain and wind stepping out of
the sky towards you You can see the musclebound
form the gray flesh formless yet solid as it
steps down like a titan from the sky The foot
lands but a quartermile from where you stand
but the impact causes the ground beneath you to
quake  You strangely feel comfort You
cant look away from this figure As the hand
comes down and gently rests on the ground before
you before it turns upward to a palm a
sourceless voice comes into your head a voice
youve never heard For all that youve chased
this mystery what this beacon is this is the first
time youve heard a voice through this imagery
All it says is You walk the right path Be
strong Dont forget who you were and decide who
you will become The vision fades back into
darkness  Another blast of thunder and
this time you wake up suddenly The rain is still
pouring outside Youre amongst the grass Can we
get everybody else back in please
 You wake up Youre shivering a bit from the
cold and the night air The ground has dampened
even beneath the cart You were sleeping beneath
the cart right
 You forgot to say goodbye Shes just gone
 Roll a perception check no
 As you come to consciousness through this
evenings rest for your final watch as you gather
after that sleep is probably not going to find its
way to you again for the rest of the evening Who
is taking the final watch with you
 One of you two make the watch perception
roll
 Just make a single roll
 As you all rest for the final length of the
evening Yasha and Nott you stay up chatting as
much as you like or staying quiet as much as you
like The rain still pouring through in sheets
heavily
 Its about a quartermile walk from where you
are but you can head there
 Yeah you can get there A little jaunt down
there Soaking wet as the rain still pours down
You approach and you come to the halfsplintered
form of one of the larger trees in this section
There are a few dotted singular trees or clusters
around but this was once a tall and proud tree
As you approach you can see near the top its been
carved right down the center and part of it has
splintered and exploded There are chunks of
wood around the vicinity and you can see even
amongst the rain on the interior of the exposed
trunk there are still faintly orange glowing
embers from where the bolt had struck through the
night
 The bark is a harder utensil to utilize to
carve into bark
 You can take it and carve in the edge there
using the tip It takes you a few minutes to do
so but you manage to complete the shell of the
symbols outline and then make your trek back to
join up with Nott
 As Nott cuddles up alongside Yashas
comparably hulking form to keep out of the water
you finish your final watch as you both watch the
sun begin to rise over the horizon or at least
you cant see the sun but you can see the day
grows lighter as it makes its way over the cloud
cover The rain is not quite as strong and the
lightning seems to have subsided but it is still
a light drizzle when it comes to the proper
morning As the rest of you come to consciousness
completing your long rest the day is yours damp
as it may be The low fog and mist still
encompasses most of the valley around you and
its a beautiful sight as you glance around first
thing in the morning You can see only the tops of
the hills slowly breaking through the layer of
cold mist that hits the lower valleys between that
shifting topography As you look off you can now
have a much better view of the Silberquel Ridge
above this large mountain range that marks the
geological center of the empire As you glance
down you can barely make out what might be the swamp
 Its pretty cold Id say its probably in
the high s
 Its not freezing point yet but its
definitely cold and wet
 Where Molly pointed over there you see what
was once a tree is destroyed and splintered
 Its impressive
 Make an investigation check
 Actually this would be more of a nature
check
 Its struck by lightning man Pretty
impressive
 It split and a lot of the tree is still
standing but its broken open from the center
and one half of its broken away and shot off into
multiple pieces
 Okay cool
 Fair enough
 No you guys are moving on
 You are now
 Jester jumps onto one of the horses backs
As you guys begin to pick up speed and head down
youre now at the very top of this major series of
hill clusters and making your way down towards the
base of the Silberquel Ridge
 Do you have alchemy supplies on you
 All right I would like you to make hold
on its roll plus proficiency because youre
proficient in alchemy plus this will have to be
dexterity at disadvantage because youre in the
back of a moving cart
 Correct
 You manage to succeed in spite of the at
one point it gets a little dodgy and you almost
drop it and catch it before it begins to spill the
nearly completed acidic formula all over the
center of the wooden cart eating through it
 You manage to complete one vial of acid so
you can mark that down
 As you guys approach the mountain range you
can see the clouds now that have pressed down
obscure the peaks of the top of the range You can
see the darkened mountainous form vanishing up
into the top gray whereas in the distance
sheets of rain that are still coming down much
heavier to the north obscure your ability to see
further beyond the northward valley to either side
of the range You also see the southern base of
the mountains which is the direction youre
heading You get the sense that the watershed
that most of the mountain range seems to almost
lean to a southward direction so the watershed of
all the rain pours and slides down the mountain to
this one central southern area and there you see
the darkened tangled thick swamp of Labenda
your destination
 Sitting deep green and distant tangled and
sprawling before you
 From where you are now Id say its eight
or so miles
 Continuing your path on for a little bit of
the morning eventually you begin to watch as the
grasses begin to give way to more moistened
thats a fun word to use moistened terrain The
normal dry even after a rain the damp ground
is now becoming sludgy and the path itself the
road seems to have been wellbuilt and set for
this type of travel But even then its starting
to gather on the wheels a bit as you ride through
and you can see bits of it are clustering up and
leaving this groove in the ground behind you
 Okay and you move around each one It
doesnt get too bad thankfully because its
still pretty slick When it clumps on it
generally slides off Its not immediately damp
from the first time for most of the vicinity
here
 The rain does eventually begin to subside
However the edge of the swamp begins to breach
the path that youre heading You begin to see the
swamp grasses take over from the hillside You
begin to see the heavy puddles of swamp bog water
beginning to appear to the right and left The
trees youre used to seeing here in the middle of
the field are giving way to banyan trees and other
thickertrunked gnarled bases heavy thick
vinecovered canopies The insects begin to fill
the air with a weird buzzing
 Make a perception check
 About half an hour or so of travel along the
road into the center of Labenda Swamp the humid
air prevents the mounting sweat on your body from
evaporating causing your sweat to pool in your
armor in uncomfortable ways Your breathing is
somewhat shallow as you adapt to the moisture in
the air around you The everpresent hum of the
buzzing insects begins to permeate the atmosphere
around you while the musky stench of decaying
plants and stagnant water grow stronger the
further in you pass A very low fog since its
still relatively early in the day sits across the
surface of the water thats exposed in patches
between where the thick roots and soft rotting
vegetation seems to be sitting like a spongy
ground
 As you push down it sinks a few inches As
you pull back the portion that you had pressed in
remains but the water begins to fill up the space
where your staff had pushed in
 You guys continue further into the swamp
You get about another half hour or so on the path
before Beauregard Caleb Molly and Jester all at
once you hear this strange trilled cry of some
kind Its like 
 Mage Armor
 You hear it again only this time it sounds
intense or frantic The strange 
 It sounds singular so far
 Its coming to the right off the road like
deep into the swamp
 You guys are still moving forward on the
path
 Make a perception check
 As youre glancing out there a piece of
stray vegetation falling from one of the nearby
trees flitters into your eye
 No effect
 Faintly
 No she was pushing off the path This road
is designed to not sink heavy with the rest of
the swamp material A lot of travel happens in and
out on this main path on the byway As long as
youre on the path for the most part you should
be fine
 This is the path to Berleben The Bromkiln
Byway is the road youre taking
 Youre in the swamp
 Yes and Berleben is further in the swamp
 Make a nature check
 It sounds similar to a crow cry but it
sounds frantic Youve heard the sound similar to
it before when you once as a child watched a crow
snatched in the jaws of some sort of hunting cat
Right before its bones were crushed and it went
lifeless its a very similar sound
 No just the sound Its loud enough where
its not that far off the road but its not in
sight right now Theres too many tree trunks
obscuring your vision
 They are but theyre not super thick
Theres still light coming through and as you
travel there are bits and pieces that overhang
the road but you still have open sky ahead of
you You dont think its going to continue the
further into the swamp you go
 Roll a dexterity check
 With a deft flick of his finger he
manages to pluck the piece of vegetation from your eye
 It gently hits the side of Mollys cheek
 You who have been keeping a discerning eye
and you rolled what on your perception check before
 Roll again as youve stopped at this place
here
  Something shifts in the water ahead
almost beyond your vision Something that was
stationary before and looked like a log that had
been resting in the water dips away from you in
the direction of the noise
 Okay go ahead and mark that
 You guys are still on the path yeah
 It moved away from you
 It moved in the direction of the sound You
hear it again 
 This terrain is pretty similar to you yeah
In places where you grew up some hunting and some
places in your nomadic lifestyle put you in
terrain very similar to this So youre pretty
comfortable here
 Nothing
 What are you guys doing Anything
 Continues for a bit
 No reaction
 Yeah youre maybe an hour into it
 They were cut off from the safe house You
dont know where the safe house is or what
location it is at
 As far as you know yes
 There are a number of tall trees
 Sure you want to get a little closer and
climb a tree
 Make a general athletics check as you jump
off the side your legs  into the swamp
as they sink about a foot with each step leaving
these heavy footprints behind that fill with water
 You make your way through the swamp the
suction doesnt stop you one bit You grab the
nearby tree and climb to the top and get off to a
branch and look in the direction Make a
perception check please Thats cocked How could
you do that
 Ten Thats enough Over the edge you glance
down and you can see past the tree line maybe
about  or so feet from where you are theres a
small clearing this open area Where the water
is there is a thick bit of black bog It looks
almost like a thick swampy tarish little pool
You can see a part of a tree has fallen into it
and the liquid is generally darkening the bottom
of where its been stuck You dont know how long
its been there There is the dark root and
crooked branches and elements of it sticking up
in the air The smell of bog rot is very strong
even from this proximity to it You see something
moving in the center of this bog struggling
shifting You see covered in this tarlike
material and flailing some sort of humanoid
creature of jet black skin Its not skin
feathers Its fighting against the swamp its
small Shifting out of the water off to the side
slowly up to the bog probably what Beau saw
earlier some sort of reptilian creature with a
long snout and a long tail Curving around and
making its way slowly towards the bog As the
flailing bird creature is attempting to give a

 Thats true That was going to be a uhoh
over here Whats the DC on that
 Its all good
 The DC on any of your spells
 Plus seven It fails Roll damage
  points of damage All of this divine
energy suddenly bursts and burns around the
creatures body As it suddenly spins with this
hiss in the direction looking around and seeing
nothing there
 You see her in the tree you dont see what
shes looking at and pointing at She climbs down
the tree and begins running in that direction
 Shes ran off
 You are yeah Youre staying on your horse
to get there
 Well its cool for the first minute before
it goes 
 Oh got you Roll to attack
 Yeah that hits All right cool So
timeline worked out
 As you approach this is the visual from the
side that you see
 This here is the gator that you see making
its way there It is very large
 Jester you make your way up over to that
side The rest of you are currently trying to
catch up on that end of the table That being the
case I need everyone to roll initiative
 Keep it in mind
 Heading this direction
 North is that way Thats the direction you
were traveling was this direction Youre heading
this way
 Correct  to   to 
 Beau you got 
 Molly you got 
 That brings us to  to ten
 Whatd you get Jester
 
 You got a six
 Beau and Molly youre up first At a full
double dash you can catch up at this point
almost to Jester Its rough terrain because its
a swamp You guys well say get about there and
Molly youre a little bit behind because Beau is
a little faster than you
 Correct Thats your turn That gets us to
Jester
 You can go
 Where are you placing that  feet range
 Its rough terrain against the swamp because
its very 
 As far as you can get yeah
  Youre not meant to stand on this
Its really obnoxious yeah Well say right
there Youre on it
 You can get almost to it with a foot
range
 Right there is the closest you can get
 Correct
 Okay so youre holding
 Can you use an action to hit with it I
think its a bonus action
 Sorry
 This is his lucky day This lollipop
apparates out of the swamp water and is now
hovering there
 You got it Ending Jesters turn that
brings us to Yasha Full run Whats your speed
  feet Youre right up next to Beau
 No thats double dash because you guys all
stayed back while Jester ran in Youre all barely
getting caught up to her at this point Caleb
youre up
 Thats about as far as you get right there
Well say comparatively Just knock them around
 It chips the paint better
Nott youre up
 With your regular movement speed youll get
up to where Caleb is Sorry where Molly is
 Bonus action dash will get you up to where
up to the edge and about well say right there
 Yeah Up to you
 Its swampy 
 Go for it arcing it over With
disadvantage
 No It goes wide Sticks into one of the
nearby swamp trees over here That ends your turn
 You can so do that as you release the
bolt
 Thats a failure with a two Roll damage
 All right Three
 It approaches
 the bird creature It doesnt have its
action to strike it unfortunately because it had
to get the extra movement Coming out of the way
here you see

 Because at this point you realize the one
that was approaching it was approaching it from
the opposite direction that Beau saw the other
thing move
 Thats the one that Beau must have seen It
begins to emerge from the brush underneath
Theres this low growl You hear the growling
sucking sound as it approaches
 Its going to make a strike
 Natural one Thats fucking lucky As it
attempts to bite out towards it the small bird
creature scrambles backward and manages to beat
its jaw out of the way It is going to attempt to
swing around and swing its tail in its direction
A two Are you fucking serious
 Okay Apparently So yeah
 Although technically the creature is
restrained so it does have advantage on its
attacks Yeah attack rolls against it have
advantage because its restrained So the first
attack missed the bite The tail does hit The
jaws it missed with a one and a two on the first
strike The second one it swings with its tail
Hey
 Im going by the rules Its restrained The
second one the tail does hit Crack This is
going to be  points of bludgeoning damage As
the tail cracks across the scrambling bird you
watch as it goes limp and is currently
unconscious its tiny form now stuck in the bog
and unmoving
 Now its Fjords turn
 Your speed will get you about there You and
Caleb are about the same space
 Roll the attacks
 Five points
 Did you roll for the attacks on each of
those
 Nine misses
  misses Both go wide off into space No
damage to that croc However as it slams into the
wood nearby and the ground it turns in your
direction noticing now the arriving brigade
 Top of the round now Molly and Beau
 Well say for the purposes of this at
movement because the space is not right here so
Im going to get you on the edge of the map for
your movement
 Sure you are
 The closest gator Okay then Let me pull it
up here Thats a
 Enthrall Thats probably a bard spell
Enthrall All right You weave a
distracting string of words 
 It has advantage on the save because you
guys have attacked it
 Thats a two plus zero That is an eight
plus zero
 I dont think it makes it actually Youre
really lucky
 Whats your spell DC It should say Is it
charismabased
 Its a wisdom save but is the ability
your racial ability
 Yeah then its charismabased because all
of them are so its DC ten It still succeeds
actually It rolled really poorly So the creature
has disadvantage to perceive any creatures other
than you until the spell ends
 It seems to have paid attention I mean it
senses all of your presence but its focused on
you If any of you are trying to get around
stealthily its going to have a hard time
noticing you That ends your turn
 All righty Beau
 You can get up to here Id say if you move
at the same pace Thats your movement You have
your action and your bonus still
 If you want to spend a ki point to do your
step of the wind
 Almost
 Although if you arent moving towards that
tree and you move there instead
 No thats still the same Yeah just out of
range
 You can if you spend a ki point
 All right Go for it You get two at the
creature
  hits
 Both hit Roll damage on each
 As you throw them both they 
and its like  and it opens its jaws
 That end your guys turns Jester youre
up
 Right here
 Sure Make an athletics check
 Sure let me put you up there in the tree
 At level three a different target
 Thats pretty great Whats the wisdom save
on that
 Wisdom save
 Con save All right
 A  on that one
 He succeeds Thats a  on the other
That one however is blinded
 You watch as all of a sudden the eyes
darken and it begins to  flailing about
unable to actually make a bead on where any of you
are at the moment
 Yep and advantage on attack rolls against
it
 Boop Go for it
 Thats not concentration correct
 Just lasts for a minute
 Yes
 At the end of each of its turns it can make
a constitution saving throw Good to know
 That hits Roll damage
 Nice Your lollipop slams into the back of
that distant alligator but its still right there
with the unconscious creature in front of it
starting to figure out where to keep its focus It
seems hungry but its also being assaulted That
ends Jesters turn Yasha youre up
 Movement will get you up to there
 Okay Your vision goes faintly dark red as
you begin to focus your frustration towards these
creatures What do you do
 You can use your action to move if you want
to
 At least itll get you into the fray Thats
as close as you can get there
 That ends your turn Caleb youre up
 Scorching Ray Go for it Roll three attacks
on it right
 How many rays is it Three rays
 Correct
 That hits
 Nice
 They all hit Second set of rolls is
doubled
 Nice Not bad at all Looking up at the
distance you tug on the glove and release as
these three bolts arc out and slam into the rather
broad side of this reptilian creature this large
crocodile thats now
 Blinded
 Okay With that you get to about there
 Ending Calebs turn Nott youre up
 Yep
 Go for it
 You got to roll them in order though
because you dont know if the one that got sneak
attack is You have to declare that when it
happens
 Well you only get sneak attack once per
round
 Second one got crit
 Right So the first one wouldve been sneak
attack
 First strike
 Sneak attack you only get once per turn
Not per round per turn So you can still get it
on a reaction
 Whatever you rolled on the dice doubled
 Eight points of damage
 Ten points of damage This poor gator turned
around went blind got shot multiple times
blasted with fiery beams
 No its just so focused on him That ends
your turn
 That ends your turn It is now the crocs
turns  It actually climbs up the
rock after you  and then goes and takes
a swipe down at you
 That is  to hit
 With that d plus five
 Yeah Its a large set of jaws
  points of piercing damage halved You
take ten points of piercing damage but you are
grappled as the giant jaws slam into you and hold
you in place Youre unable to escape at that point
 Its going to take a swing with its tail
towards you as its flailing about hearing noise
in that direction It has disadvantage against
you Thats  and  That misses in the first
attack as its tail goes wide It turns around and
snaps its jaws towards the tree and scrapes off
the side of the tree and swings in your direction
as it attempts to bite towards you Thats going
to be a  Whats your armor class
 s your armor class Thats right You
have the jaws slam onto you You suffer  points
of piercing damage but because youre raging
thats reduced to nine You get nine points of
piercing damage but you are grappled and
restrained currently as you are now trapped in
its jaws You watch as Notts hands are dangling
out of its toothy jaws its swinging her in the
air Yasha is lifted up off her feet and is
currently trying to pry the jaws open off of her
body but is unable to do so Death saving throw
for the creature Thats a failure Fjord youre up
 Holding Nott Go for it
 Thatll do
 You got it
 Nice As you release the two bolts they manage
to peek around the tree see it grasping Nott in
its jaws and swinging her back and forth One hits
the bottom of the jaw and the other hits its
side You see this little splatter of dark crimson
alligator blood from the two impacts but its
still holding taut to this tiny little morsel it
has in its jaws
 All right Want to move Caleb up for me
Beau Somebody
 Im sorry Meant to say Fjord to Caleb
 At least you guys have range That brings us to the
top again Molly and Beau
 Yeah
 That is a  on the saving throw for the
blind crocodile so it does resist the blindness
Its vision comes back However it fucked it up for a
round Beau
  hits
 That hits With two strikes with the staff
 Seven damage each So  Cool Its 
points of damage with the two strikes
 Slamming into the side of its heavy thick
scaled hide Its hurting but its definitely a
resistant beast
 You pull your staff behind and then you go
to a punch and a dropkick
 Way to go That hits
  misses unfortunately but you do get
one punch off After slamming it twice you go for
the softer part and whack
 Oh gotcha but there you go
 Okay Moving on Thats fine Its okay
Its still a fair amount of damage Molly what
are you doing
 Thats it
 Unfortunately you guys are running through
a swamp behind who engaged it so its an
unfortunate circumstance
 Fortune favors the bold in this case
 Sure That is a natural 
 A swamp bug goes into your throat as youre
trying speak it and you have to cough it out for
a second That finishes Mollys run Jester
youre up
 Okay Roll to heal on that one Its within
range
 Six points of healing You watch as
suddenly its yellow eye flickers and looks around
for a second and it begins to push against the
slickness
 It looks at it  It begins to
try and pull its way back out of the bog Its
getting stuck and sliding in but its trying to
pull itself backward Thats your turn Jester
 Yasha youre up
 In its jaws So you are restrained You can
still attack it but youre at disadvantage on all
your attacks
 If you reckless itll become regular
attacks
 All right Make your two strikes First one
with divine fury as you swing down towards the top
of its jaws with your blade
 As you go to swing the jaws tense against
you and  it hurts and all your muscles tense
from the pain but you stay focused going for your
second strike
  does hit roll damage This still gets
divine fury though because its the first strike
that you hit with
  points of damage How do you want to do
this

 You guys have been plugging everything into
this one croc since the beginning of the battle
 Yeah you can because youre inside of it
 You pull yourself you pull the jaws open
and step out of it getting your feet on the
ground as you yank apart You put your leg up into
it and  You feel the jaw pop It falls
back for a moment its jaw now limp and its tongue
lolling out to one side You have your blade and
you do the finishing blow
 Oh I mean describe to me the finishing
blow
 Breaking its jaw isnt going to kill it So
how do you kill it
 Okay After breaking the jaw you step out
pull the blade from behind you and with a wide swipe
like an anticavalry blow you cut through the
side of its throat and neck It doesnt get all
the way through but it cuts enough through the
spine where it falls to the ground This long
heavy limp piece of luggage Well leave that
there for its size though You going to stay
where you are You want to move Because you still
have movement youve been released from its jaws
 Thats as far as you can get Well you can
get there actually
 Okay That ends your turn Yashas finished
Caleb youre up
 Moving your speed will get you right up to
the edge there so its just out of  feet
 Sorry
 Thats five missiles
 Trudging through the swamp cast the spell
and then release The five missiles all impacting
at once
 Broken clock
 Along its side of it its still holding
Nott in its mouth and Notts muffled screaming
from inside of its jaws as it swings her back and
forth It seems singularly focused on destroying
whatever it has its mouth on Its a beast That
finishes your turn Caleb
 Nott its your turn
 I need you to contest it Its an escape DC
of  its athletics or acrobatics your choice
 Make the check
  is enough You manage to just squeeze out
of its jaws and land back on the ground where you
are slipping out a brief moment of its opening
and get there Theres blood streaked down you
can feel the pain from the teeth that have been
digging into your body
 It would yeah
  misses You pull out and from being
shaken around youre a bit dizzy and the pain
swelters in your body and as you go to fire it
ricochets off of its hide
 Right now
 Technically yes actually
  does hit roll damage
  points of damage sneak attack The first
strike hits underneath the throat slips into a
piece of its already open cracked heavy hide and
it 
 Its advantage on every strike
 Thats better roll damage for that one
This rollercoaster the emotions
 I know
 Five points of damage
 No because its not attacking anything
thats outside of you
 Correct
 No worries
 Away from over here
 Thats as far as you can get right there It
does try and snatch its jaws towards you in the
process Thats a natural 
 Thats an eight nine and a five
  plus five  points of piercing damage
 You can use it once per round yeah
  points of piercing damage however you
are grappled in its jaws
 I know but as you try and break away
Were talking like Deep Blue Sea Samuel L
Jackson As you run away the jaws grab and pull
you back and youre being held and shaken again
 Now you do yes
 As it strikes out and grapples Nott in the
jaws you do manage to get one swing at it
 A lot of sharks in Kamordah its a thing
 Oh shit Roll some damage on that
  points of damage all right Crack You
hit it right across the snout and upon the impact
its eyes go dazed for a second but it continues to
chew Its still standing That finishes Notts
turn All right The one standing croc is going to
drop Nott out of its jaws
 And attempt to bite again
 Curse of the Eyeless amplified Actually
before it bites its going to swing with its
tail Its going to spin around and attempt to
slam you with its tail Thats disadvantage on
that strike Thats cocked Cocked again
Disadvantage Even with disadvantage thats a 
 The tail hits you Thats d
 Thats  points of bludgeoning damage
 I know But it has advantage on a prone
creature
 Thats a  to hit whats your armor
class
 Im going to make a quick call here
 No Im calling Jeremy Crawford to
confirmation
 I know its still active by rules as
written I guess
 Yeah spells end when they say they end
 You dont want to You dont want to take
it Well hold on
 Rarely references the Great Wall No thats
a  still so with the Haste bonus that would
still miss yeah So heres what happens As you
fall unconscious
 As you fall unconscious your form is
blurring slightly from the impact and as you
tumble and it goes to strike and bite you youre
tumbling backward at such a speed still under the
effect of the spell carrying you that you fall
out of grasp of its jaws as you spin and spill out
of its mouth as the teeth clamp Plummeting to the
ground Not taking a critical hit and immediately
failing two death saving throws
 Do you have any  gold diamonds
 Not worth  gold
 Im just saying you got to buy your spell
components
 No
 Laura Its okay Components that cost
money you have to purchase
like his diamond and his incense
 Yeah
 Well that finishes the crocs turn As the
Haste spell snatches Nott from the jaws of almost
imminent death Fjord youre up
 That gets you up onto the battlefield
there
 It puts you within  feet its just out of
 foot range
 Yeah
 Sometimes it doesnt help to lag
 Go for it roll for the attacks
  hits
  just misses
 How do you want to do this

 Both of the impacts of the Eldritch Blasts
hit it its still up on the rock after snatching
its jaw in the air and missing Nott as she tumbles
out of it the head comes down and turns towards
you As its jaws open both up into the throat
You watch as the back of its head bursts behind
it Its eyes go dull before it slumps over the
rock and it slowly slides into the edge of the
swamp nearby
 She can yeah
 Shes an illusion Correct Here in this
instance the illusion would not I dont think
be affected by the rough terrain
 There you go
 Correct at ndlevel
 That heals you up there you come to
consciousness Nott
 You guys take a moment finish yelling at
each other Jester has jumped down from the tree
calls your attention There still struggling in
the marsh you see the small black feathered bird
creature And were going to take a break because
up right at that moment in a few moments Im
going to sit down because I can do that right now

 Guys
 Yeah
 Dont tempt me You guys all take a moment
tend to your exhaustion from plunging into this
swamp haphazardly some of you taking quite a
beating in the process Jester guides your
attention to this now struggling small bird
creature It looks to be about the size of a an
adolescent child maybe no more than well lets
say a little younger than that maybe like an
eight or nine year old But instead of skin its
just black feathers No wings really the feathers
are too small among the arm to actually be
flightready The lower half of its body is still
sunken and thick in the bog It has where its
face is two bright yellow eyes very crow
ravenlike eyes and a long black pointed beak And

 
 
 Make a strength check
  With just a few moments though your
legs sink in a bit you manage to pull find
leverage grab onto some of the heavy vines on the
side and you manage to pull this creature out
from the bog until eventually it gets its legs
free and as it pulls its way up to the top it
begins to shrug off the thick bog slop that was
keeping it stuck there in the center of the opening
 
 
  Do you live around here

 
  A kid
  And points its still soggy
feathered arm to the east
 
  Looks towards you and starts
walking up towards you pulls open your coat
Starts rummaging through pulls one of the
books
  Please no
 Begins to write into the book and shows it
to you It says Thank you
 It says four the number four The name is
Kiri
 
 Begins writing out an extended statement in
the paper Puts out to you and it says Family
going west Traveling Escaping east mountains
Skies go dark there Father said the valley folk fighting
 
 
 
 Begins writing another small essay in the
book
 Make a perception check One of you Take it
with advantage
 One of you is aiding the other Unless you
want to make two separate rolls Its up to you
 All right Go for it
 Okay You guys are keeping an eye out in the
space around you
 Make an investigation check 
Finishes writing and shows it over it says
Swamp was to hide us Swamp folk saw us So we
ran to not be taken I wasnt watching and the bog
caught me Family couldnt pull free Couldnt
risk sisters or selves so kept going
 Stuck here for a while Not their fault
Dont want them to die for my carelessness
Closes the book 
 
 Girl
 Puts up four fingers with long exaggerated
feathered fingertips
 You havent encountered these people before
 Youve heard of various different strange
races out there Bird people may have crossed in a
story before but Youve done a little bit of
study Make a nature check for you Caleb since
you studied in this area just general knowledge
 Kenku yes you know Theyre usually very
removed Locationwise they usually exist on the
far outskirts of the Empire if anywhere They have
small family units that live on their own There
isnt so much of a kenku culture they belong to
Theyre small little groups They look out for themselves
 Correct As part of their history and you
rolled a natural  so you know quite a bit
something in their lineage there was a curse
involved Something based around the time of their
creation where their ability to converse was
taken from them
 
 She points in a northeastern direction
 Writes on the page spins it around it says
Nowhere to go Can I come with you
 Looks back at the bog goes
  Im okay
 
  Its sharp
 Holding the dagger she goes forward and
starts pecking out of your hand
 The head turns to you as well Takes it
 You rolled investigation
 It looks like its very old and has long
fallen over and has been absorbed mostly by the
swamp It doesnt look like it was a large
structure Like it might have been a small brief
gatehouse off the path Some sort of a watch post
that had
 Make an investigation check
 Looking through it and making out the layout
of it it was definitely a post house for Berleben
when it was first made The stones look well over
 years old They have long been reclaimed by
the roots and vines of the swamp Nothing special
beyond that really Just an abandoned post
 Hard grip on it
 Okay
 Natural 
 Yeah You take two points of damage Youre
like Oh Not bad
 Yeah
 You begin to carve into the two crocodiles
 Whoever is helming that make a medicine
check to understand what parts of the body are
most delicate To try and open it without
 Itll take you the better part of the day to
carve off enough of the hide to really be useful
for trading Its a long process These are big
creatures You begin to carve off some of its
hide None of you are experienced tanners so its
a lot of trial and error and sections of it
tearing off prematurely Its a very messy
process Jester is like hand to elbow covered in blood
 Have you checked in its stomach You find a
lot of bones a lot of partially digested meat
and a lot of black feathers
 A while yeah
 Sure
 Looks to be yeah
 Looks a handful
 I dont know I just want to get back to my
family
 There is an interesting point here let me
check something real fast here
 Yeah this is going to be a point
 No thats interesting Interesting point
After casting the spell there is no language to
understand its only through mimicry You managed
to get the jist of that initial statement through
talking with it for a while but the spell has no
effect
 There is no spoken language
 Looking through with your medicine check it
looks like theres only three between the two of them
 They look to be little
 Standing at full height maybe about three
and a half feet
 To actually harvest the actual armored hide
will get you pretty close to dusk
  Sidekick
  Mom and dad
 
  Ill carry this leather to
the cart She helps you to start lifting the
carved stuff but barely at all
  Walks right up to you like
face 
 
 And goes back to helping Jester
 
 She is spellbound by this moment of a cat
appearing in her hands
 
 Throws the cat down seemingly weirded out
by the moment doesnt quite know how to react
 Picks up Frumpkin and runs towards the cart
as you guys get there and load it up Kiri jumps
up into the cart and turns around to the rest of
you and goes  Welcome to The Mighty
Nein And starts petting Frumpkin
 Sure Make an insight check
 Its a bird person Im bird p Not that
kind of bird person but
 
 Its a nice flannel Im going to want it
back Right now Yeah
 Its pretty chilly Its like mids
 It feels warmer than it is because of the
moisture in the air but its not like warm
 Points up in front of the road in that
direction
 Following the Bromkiln Byway your vision
pierces the dense tangle of trees and vines to see
the distant glow of lanterns just as the sun sets
and the evening sky grows dark Closer still you
make out a strange mismatch of varying levels that
make up the village Whole areas stand on stilts
and raised platforms connected by bridges while
much of the city to the eastern side appears to be
partly submerged in bog water The browns greens
and grays of the marsh itself is reflected in the
browns greens and grays of the people who now
wander the streets going about their business
Welcome to Berleben a somewhat miserablelooking
but functional village here in the Dwendalian
Empire As you come off the road the road gives
way into this central district which looks to be
a smattering of stone slabs cobblestone and
whatever pieces of material were left over from
construction that helped fix and maintain a main
road here in the central opening before it
scatters into the rest of the city What would you
like to do
 Yeah
 In the Puddin
 There are people walking through the
streets Some of them are carrying small sacks
over their shoulder from one place to another or
in the process of wandering over to make about
their business for the city and they notice you
approach and theyre slightly nosey paying
attention to these strangers that came in off the
Byway
 Okay To look like
 All righty 
  She seems fascinated and
enthralled by this
  Its terrifying
 Theres still this long dark beak poking
through but you got what you got
 Yeah Plague Doctor it up
 Theres one older woman going by whos
hunched has her own hood up and a long gray
cloak Shes wearing a stained linen blouse and
says What do you want
 Weathers shit
 Keystone Pubs in the Puddles that way
 Look for the crooked tower thing
 I mean you can I wouldnt be caught dead
there
 What the fuck is pocket bacon
 Im very confused but Ill take it Puts
it in her pocket keeps walking
 The whole campaign shes been subtly
stealthily stealing bacon
 There are You do actually see a handful of
crownsguard Theyre present its still part of
the Empire though they look to be somewhat
lackluster At least their armor isnt as shiny
and wellkept It looks like one of them is like
Ah fucking hell Theyre stationed here and
theyre probably not very appreciative and have
tried their best to adapt to the life here in the
Labenda Swamp but they are visible throughout the
town including The Puddles which you begin to go
towards Almost half of the city takes up The
Puddles It looks like it was the oldest portion
of the town The original Berleben was just this
district called The Puddles The entirety of it
is beneath between one to three inches of water so as you
begin to descend from the central area of the
town you begin to submerge your feet and the
entire rest of the city has slowly been sinking
into the swamp Its like slowly wading through a
tide at the beach Its also very much the
impoverished side If you could imagine an area of
the swamp more impoverished than what youve
already come across this is it You see a lot of
huts and hovels All the buildings here on top of
being older masonry and stone structures in
construct the bases themselves are a deep algae
green from the floor to about halfway up about
two or three feet where moss and fungus and
various other plant matter have slowly grown as
the liquid that has been soaking into the vicinity
is slowly growing up the sides of these buildings
Theres a fountain that has completely folded in
now at this point It has fallen into itself Bits
of the water seem to have permeated through Its
an older relic of the earlier construction
period
 It does nothing
 Crownsguard keep an eye on you as you are
the newcomers that walk in You do notice as you
head down to the Puddles that one of the guards
that watched you enter trails back about  or so
feet slowly walking and keeping an eye
 Yeah its doing all right Its only about
three inches of water averaged so its not a major
hindrance Youre also going at a relatively
comfortable pace now that youre in the city
 Perception check for both of you guys
 Kiri is now enthralled in the back of the
cart hood up Frumpkin curled up on her lap and
is slowly petting him Shes slowly petting him
 You come up and
 You two
 You see it first and as soon as you look in
that direction you catch up with that Fjord You
spot a small crooked tower maybe about  or so
feet high It looks like there was originally a
building here that fell into itself and collapsed
and they built a pub on top of it Not very well
so its a haphazard construct that looks somewhat
unstable with bits of broken stone and The only
way you can get up into it are rope ladders
hanging down the front of it that lead into an
archway thats open on the top There are two oil
lanterns hanging from the outside that give this
faint glow to the exterior From the inside it
looks warmly lit though dark
 Its about an eightfoot climb to get to the
threshold of the interior
 Thats what it looks like yeah
 You guys guide your way that way You manage
to catch up with the crownsguard who is walking
As soon as he sees you slowing behind he lets you
catch up
 You just leave it on the base of the tower
 As you approach the guard turns to you
Evening miss
 Out of towners
 All right just dont make any trouble
 Dont like interesting
 No trouble miss
 Hes staring right through you
 Your name first
 Beau
 Crownsguard Alexander
 I dont like you
 I can imagine
 Dont start any trouble
 Good Get on your way
 As you wait there this awkward  second
stare he goes Ill just
 Be on your way He turns around and walks
back to his post
 Are you guys keeping Kiri in the cart
 Kiri climbs up with you 
  All right
  Protect
 
 
  Thats true
 She hands Frumpkin to you and climbs up the
rope with the rest of you As you guys climb up the
eightfoot jaunt up to the side you step up past
the threshold into the archway and are immediately
met with this toughlooking albino dwarf dude
Hes standing there with pale white skin jet
whitegray hair white eyebrows big white beard
with this black leather vest thats tucked into
billowing dark brown pants and boots Hes got all
these scars and tattoos across his forearms hes
folded and he goes Right Steps back lets you
in
 Gives a nod He continues to glare as you
guys step inside Within its a warmly lit cozy
space that resembles being belowdeck on a ship at
sea Youre right at home here Fjord Its all
dark wood from all different angles and its
cramped too so it has that similar feel All the
light in here are a handful of oil lanterns so
its pretty heavily shaded in certain areas so
youre only catching rim lighting and soft light
on certain faces around here Theres maybe six
patrons in here total To the right this loud
banging sound as two individuals in the process of
building some sort of a stage in the corner
immediately to your right Its small maybe
fivefoot by fivefoot but its in the process of
being built To your left you see the bar Its
an Lshaped bar not terribly large There behind
it theres three oil lamps set up they light the
area You can see some of the liquor bottles and
the ale kegs and everything set up towards the
back of the bar In the front with one patron
sitting on a stool you see a rather
cheerfullooking middleaged male gnome as the
purveyor of this establishment Hes got puffy
black hair and heavy mutton chops on the sides of
his face this bulbous rosy nose Hes in the
process of pouring and refilling this tankard for
the patron whos leaning against the bar in front
of him this grufflooking fisherman human dude
He gives a glance over to you as you step in
taking in the vicinity and goes Hey Welcome to
the Keystone Pub Oldest pub in the Labenda The
oldest pub in the Labenda is beneath this one but
we rebuilt it
 Thank you very much Glad you could make
it Where are you all from
 Alfield thats a bit of a journey isnt
it Well glad you could make it Not many folks
come that far over here to visit the swamp
 I am Dent Bonswallow
 Dent Bonswallow
 Perception check
 Its too dark in here unfortunately
Theres only six other patrons but theyre too
dimly lit for you to make out any features
 As Jester begins walking off through the
chamber hes like What can I get you guys What
you asking for What you looking for
 That would be the Labenda Throat Grog
 Labenda Throat Grog
 Burns you like a fucker

Almost three centuries
 Yeah
 I mean youre there
 Yeah Its the finest pub in town
 Hey its rough to start at the top mate

Midway Docks Thats where most of the business
gets done here If youre looking for things for a
fancier space maybe you want to head to The
Stilts but thats where the whats the word Im
looking for folks who run the place stay
 Its The Stilts Its where its all raised
up Thats where the Summit House is where the
Starosta stays Theres the Mossmire Temple which
is where the druid that keeps the swamp fane
stays The Idolmaster

 Yeah He points down
 Yeah
 Do you like things that are haunted

that fell in we cleared out and we have
subterranean rooms

 Yeah
 You looking for old Febron
 I aint going to ask Hes over there Left
of the stage where it looks like hes passed out
probably in his own piss most likely He points
in the direction you can see where theyre
banging with hammers at the stage theres one guy
whos like  Just completely out
Probably drooling down the side of the face
 Hes just the contact who knows
 
 
  What the fuck you do that for
 You now have the full appearance here and
its pretty busted The Gentleman was wrong There
is one tooth but it is black and angled
 Yeah from the bottom out The lips are
cracked The left eye is angling off in an off
direction He looks like hes probably been kicked
in the face a few times by probably a horse at
some point in his childhood Hes definitely had a
rough go at life probably but has seemed to have
carved a living The very balding head on top
jaundiced skin looks like hes sweating from the
general humidity of the air in there along with
probably who knows how much hes been drinking and
hes sweating the alcohol through his pores
Doesnt take care of himself He looks up So
what you doing
 Why the fuck did you flick me
 From  Wheres my fucking drink
 Tension goes straight This eye goes
 Joins the other
 You were sent by The Gentleman Yeah
Whats he want
  My troubles just started mate
Dont want anything with this No Fucking out

my life more than that Few weeks back I escorted
one of his smuggled troops to the safe house in
the swamp Right The one youre asking about
Left them there with instruction to return a few
days later and escort them to the underground
river Returned and I heard something cruel Some
low echoing howl  It was much
scarier than that Shaking I got there right
Fucking hell Outside the house all of them
dead Strung up in reeds and roots Bloated and
left as a warning thats what I say I hear the
howl again and I just run
 There be curses in this swamp Have been
since before this loathsome struggle shitholes

 Accounting in DD
 His one eye wandering
 He slinks over The stage is only partially
up and the two guys go Just a moment Theyre
like Fuck off Just a fucking moment Just

he gets up on the stage
 Looks at the pouch of coins
  All the sailors say

Brandy youre a fine girl What a good wife you
could be
 I need a drink He goes back towards the
bar
 When do you want to leave
 You aint taking it back
 Im staying with you
 Sure Fine Great
 Ready to snuggle big lady
 He goes and finishes his drink Youre shown
the sleeping quarters for the evening There is a
hatch behind and to the back of the bar It looks
like a dark corner where theres almost no light
The barkeep Dent comes over and brings one of
the lanterns off the wall and opens up a hatch
and there is a ladder that leads down inside
Literally theyve cleared out most of the ruin of
the old establishment below it and there are four
separate rooms with a small hallway between like
a crosssection hallway that are built as a
subterranean sleeping quarters
 There are no windows It feels very much
like a prison cell with a bed but its functional
 One bed per room
 Its postsundown In the time of searching
the city having the drink and conversation its
 Taking all the horses and the cart to the
stables Dent looking it all over charges you
two silver for the service
 Go for it
 Seems above board yeah
 No worries happy to help He goes and
carries it off and takes care of it for the evening
 You guys gather your things and bed down for
the evening taking your respective chambers
 Sure
 That was Kiri
  Ooh Im a captain
 
 
 
 
 
  Where do babies come from
 Kiri is just enthralled
 
 If you could see a blackbird blush Molly
and Fjord
 Yeah and you guys notice two of the rooms
are dry two of the rooms have about half an inch
of water on the floor
 Half an inch of water on the floor
 All right The door closes in the chamber
 Hello
 Interesting Right okay He starts taking
 I can but its not as comfortable
 All right You first

 Lets try
 Very well He lays down on the somewhat
slightly waterlogged floor takes the pillow and
bundles it up in the corner of the room and lays
down next to it You have a little oil lamp that
you can put out
 All right You guys all eventually get to
sleep You get an evenings rest managing to
adjust to the unpleasant smell of somewhat swamp
bog watersoaked subterranean inn room but the
night comes and passes Well pick up next week as

wonderful weekend You as well We love you and
is it Thursday yet Good night

 And welcome back That was pretty creative
Well done
 Hmm thats a thlevel spell Anyway
welcome back To catch up on what previously
occurred The Mighty Nein had decided to leave
Zadash in the wake of the now declared war between
the Dwendalian Empire and the Xhorhasian hordes to
the east You decided to side with The Gentleman
a purveyor of various darker and underhanded deeds
throughout this side of the Empire who offered you
two possible contracted options You chose both
and proceeded onto your first leg of this journey
to the northeast to the Labenda Swamp and to the
city of Berleben where you were tasked to discover
what had happened to a safe house of which various
smuggled goods would be stored and then
transported through that had gone dark for a
number of weeks You packed up made your way in
that direction traversed through the outskirts of
the swamp managed to save a tiny bird friend from
being consumed by a few large crocodiles and
scoured the swamp city of Berleben in search of
some means of information to find the individual
that The Gentleman says would be able to help you
in this journey Febron Febron was found drunk
and disorderly in the Keystone Pub
 Oh so sexy Hes a right nice one But no
You managed to interrogate him made him an offer
he couldnt refuse and he agreed to lead you onto
where the safe house exists within the swamp You
rented out the rooms in the subterranean chambers
of the old and almost collapsed pub You separated
yourselves for the evening completed your rest
and we pick up as morning comes to greet you
Lightless as there are no windows and you just
eventually come to on what you assume is an
evenings full rest You all independently come to
shake your heads and get yourselves prepared for
what the next days journey arises you gather
your things and you glare at the rather awkward
Febron across the way who as you wake up is
just sitting there watching you sleep
 Well I mean Im ready to do whatever you
want Lead the way
 You guys begin to
 
  Its sharp
 
 You guys all begin to gather and make your
way up the ladder through the hatch in the floor
of the Keystone Pub which is not bustling by any
means There are maybe three patrons in the
process of having their morning ale You glance
over the side and you can see Dent Bonswallow
whos in the process of cleaning off a number of
the glasses from the night before He looks over
in your direction and goes Oh right Bright
morning to you all Rise up Would you like
breakfast of some kind hey
 Right Coming right up Go an find a place
to sit be with you in about an hour
 Well Ive got to make your food

 Hes counting About an hour
 Yeah thats all situated there There is
in the far corner of the chamber the back wall
opposite to the right of where the stage is being
constructed though right now it looks like
theres no current construction going on at the
moment a hooded figure is slowly walking towards
the table where you guys are deciding or not
whether to sit
 Okay You manage to sit on one of the small
benches on the side Scrapes the ground as you
push into the side and the
 The cloaked figure stops and takes in this
physical display and then continues to approach
 Mark if you want to step in

 Mark Hulmes longtime friend dungeon
master of High Rollers
 The first thing you see
 the individuals you
have been waiting throughout the evening to show
up begin to step through groggily complain about
the space and then claim a table as you begin to
approach which you are greeted with stares and a
cat butthole
 
  A bird
  She walks around
  Hello
 
 She pulls a dagger out
  Your underwear
I think its part of a ritual and I need to get it
 Make a perception check
 All right Glancing about
on her but she has this long green cloak thats
really covering her left side and you would
probably see that theres black scales all over
her left side and shes deliberately holding her
arm completely hidden Her arms invisible
underneath the cloak
 Make an insight check
 Welcome to playing with Caleb
  Okay It seems to be rather forthright
Yeah Seems to be on the level
 Yeah She seems nervous
 You know based on what youre asking As
far as the features if I recall theyre was it
halfelven
so slightly elven features Slightly pointed ear
but the left side covered
 Everybody who is legal within the Empire
 I think its pretty sexy to be honest You
see Febron there is this creepier old man
balding little liver spotted missing most of his
teeth one eye wandering a bit
  Welcome to the Mighty Nein
The little bird creature begins to chirp in your
direction
  Hello Kiri Im Cali
  Youre Kiri
 
 For the sake of expediency you share what
information you choose to in that space of time
but food does come to you piecemeal as your fine
Dent Bonswallow friend decides to deliver it plate by
plate as it arrives Its passable most of its a
little overcooked breakfast meats bit of rubbery
egg and thats about it A good swamp breakfast
  You hear this deep horrible
growling sound that echoes around you
 You see Kiris feathers fluffing up as she
does it 
 
 Its the sound of the crocodiles from the
battle before
 Kiri starts fluffing and loosely purring
back
 Nothing that was howlingesque
necessarily but you didnt travel too far into
the swamp
with the gators and some shadows moving around I
know a little magic but Ive never fought before
so
  This is Kiri
 Theres at this point two other patrons
but theyre not really paying attention
up to Yasha She takes her cloak off and brings
out this scaled
 Jesus Christ Thats your arm
 Yeah thats Febron
 Dont get me wrong I still think its
pretty foxy
 Been around as long as I have you live a
life of beggars cant be choosers
  Welcome to The Mighty Nein
 You gather your things finish off the
remainder of your lackluster breakfast At this
point now the morning air is chilled though
there is still humidity that permeates the swamp
vicinity You hear the bugs beginning to grow
louder with the distant cicadacricket sounds in
the distance echoing through the swamp There is a
low fog that is fairly prominent this early in the
morning You can see about  or  feet beyond
the barrier of the outer swamp before the moisture
begins to pick up You see just the shaded trunks
of trees beyond that for another  or so feet
before it becomes completely obscured by fog
 This time of year it does Its just
getting close to winter
 Not zero visibility You have traveling
about  feet of general visibility and then it
begins to get a little bit beyond that At this
point Febron chimes in Dont worry it burns off
a bit as the day goes on
 I mean were going to go through all of
it really but were going to head for the
outside of the Ounterloch
 The Ounterloch
 Were heading towards the lake Were going
to try and make our way around the outskirts of
it but were going to have to coast through the
swamp to get there That way were not trudging
through the main central area too much
 Oh I wouldnt recommend taking that with
us no
 As you guys are plotting a means out there
Kiri has the dagger out and is practicing little
swings excitedly
 Then she goes charging towards the fog
 Its The Mist
 Kiri has run past the barrier of The Puddles
on the north side of the city and is now swinging
wildly into the fog
 Runs back feet leaving a trail behind as
shes stepping through two to three inches of
swamp water across this district 
 Theres lots of creatures around that could
hurt you
 She gets right behind Yasha and sticks right
to her back with the dagger out on the opposite side
going
 Make a perception check
 You take a moment to scout the vicinity At
this point in the morning its maybe about nine
oclock or so judging by where you can see the
source of sunlight in the somewhat clouded sky
Glancing around the city not a lot of folks are
moving It seems like the nature of the swamp town
is a little bit of a slower pace of living by the
nature of the location The few folks that are
wandering around the streets are slowly getting to
their daily chores and business No one seems to
be particularly interested A few folks look over
because you are a gathered motley crew on the edge
of town but theres no one who seems to be very
focused in whats going on
 Fire Fire Fire Fire 
Caleb
 Wrapped around his weenie
 So we good to go Ready to move The longer
we take the more risk we run of getting there
about nighttime and I would feel a bit nervous
about that to be honest
 Okay so whos leading
 Im pointing the direction no but Im not
standing at the front
  gold Im pointing the direction but
look at me Im not going to defend you well
 Yeah but if I die first youre going to
be lost in this swamp
 Nott where are you
 Kiri on your shoulders
 Theres Kiri Shes up there with the two
feathered arms flopped over and  looking
around
  Meester Ford
 At this point Febrons like All right so
looking out this direction this time of day
that way Lead on big boy
 As you guys begin to step past the outskirts
of The Puddles your feet begin to sink thicker
and thicker into the swamp floor as you further
and further step away from this little bastion of
civilization With each progressive footstep you
can see the waves ripple past and then hit patches
of thick elevated vegetation thats growing and
rotting in small clusters simultaneously The tree
trunks that are faded shadows begin to come into
view and you begin to see these twisted gnarled
trees covered in vines that dangle down from these
high boughs that barely cluster out sections of
sunlight and you pass out underneath those areas
where bits of cloud begin to break through
 Ah gotcha
 Ah boughs
 Yeah its fine In pushing this forward and
guiding the path Im going to have Febron and
whoever is keeping watch on the exterior to both
make survival checks
 Right Well this isnt a perception check
this is to make their way through the swamp to
keep track of whats ahead so Im having Febron
and one of you take point on that
 This is a survival check
 Actually you both rolled pretty high Over
the next two hours or so you guys manage to keep
for the most part above any of the deeper recesses
of marsh water Leaping from cluster of tree base
and sections of ground that are mostly above the
water line it manages to go through without much
of an issue The fog does slowly begin to burn off
as the hours progress but its still present You
gather probably about the time you arrived at the
end of day yesterday to the exterior of the
Labenda Swamp there was just a faint bit of fog
at the ground It will be a number of hours before
you even reach that point but it is progressing
towards a more visible space These two hours you
guys continue forward being mindful and watching
around Those who are keeping watch I need both
of you to make perception checks or one of you
make it with advantage your choice
 Whoever else is keeping a watch You want to
make it Nott
 Go for it
 Febron at this points still looking He
says Wait hold on a second He starts doing a
little circle in the area checking out some of
the recent trees looking at the sun in the sky
and hes like Yeah I feel like were going the
right way
 Yeah we dont usually leave this early in
the morning
 
 Yeah
 He pulls out a halffilled wineskin opens
it up pours the water out
 He looks curiously at the flask and the
amount of liquid you poured in there
 Cheers indeed Tiny girl He watches as
you drink the alcohol and is confused Gets a
closer look at you at this point and he goes
 Right
 Aye Its this way Make another survival
check
parenting
 Well it was Febron and Beau
 Well this one theyre doing it
individually because you have somebody outside
of Along the path as you guys are progressing
for the next hour or so Febron and Beau are
keeping pace on this Keeping watch moving
forward you step through some of the soggier
areas of the swamp and your foot gets stuck a bit
and its starting to get a little more difficult
to traverse Febrons like Its just a few more
hours and well make our way to the outskirts of
the lake Itll be a lot easier then trust me
Itll be fine
 At this point Fjord as you are stepping
near the front you come around the corner and
without notice theres this strange sound This
 and theres a cloud of pollenlike
spores in the air right where you are I need you
to make a wisdom saving throw please
 You manage to pull back coughing a bit and
your head goes dazed for a moment but you manage
to shrug it off You guys look ahead and beyond
the area where Fjord was pushing around one of the
trees you can see this large foot wide cloud
of yellowish pollen that went  and
slowly settles into the swamp area
 Theres a whole mess of twisted vines and
plant matter in the center of the space Where it
seemed to emit from the center though you do
see one large ferntype plant thats left open and
three or four large leaves that are spread
outward
 I havent actually seen this close to one
of them I usually avoid them So lets avoid it eh
 First off I resent that
 No
 Ill take that I mean I figure its
probably in the way burn it if you can I dont
trust it
 This vicinity is about  feet around this
particular plant in the center thats lying open
face to the sky
 It would encompass the plant definitely
this green flame magic coalesces She flicks out
this green orb that fires down and when it hits
it detonates
 It emits this large blast of orangishred
fire that burns in the area Go ahead and roll
damage
more
 Shes filled with a baby
  points of fire damage This explosion
immediately evaporates the fog in the area and a
large part of the ground now is dried off You see
this mist or steam  out of where the
detonation happened The plant in the center
which is now more visible you can see snap shut
This giant three four part maw closes in the
space with these plantlike teeth Its still
there writhing in pain from the explosion It
laxes open a bit and begins to shift in your
direction It looks hurt but still alive
 All right Fire Bolt Sacred Flame thats
cocked Thats a 
  yeah so no Sacred Flame but
  hits roll damage
 Yes Or no yeah For Sacred Flame yeah
 
  points of damage As you slam it with the
Fire Bolt it  and keeps moving forward
but its hurt
 Rolled another 
  Sorry
 You guys are all preparing your various
cantrips and spells against it It begins lurching
forward You can see the charred edges of this
large vegetable plant Then Fjord steps forward
sending this arc of darker graygreen energy that
strikes into it Roll damage roll to hit first
  hits
 As it strikes this large traplike plant
it hits the center of it It bubbles up for a
second the green and red matter of the interior
swells and then pops Like a horrible fleshfilled
water balloon spatters across various areas You
guys have to take a step back and it glides
against your knees and thighs a bit
way My cantrip just 
 It just manages to avoid you But it lies
now decimated and sinking slowly into the swamp
water
time Im sorry you had to do that
 Make a perception check
 Who else wants to make a perception check
  Okay A brief breeze blows through the
swamp as you guys move on from this positioning
You hear a very faint hiss through the distant
branches of the trees singing in unison as bits
of leaves and vines clatter against themselves
from the shift But you manage to catch a sound
upon the wind that is unfamiliar to the rest of the
natural breeze Its like a chime Like a wooden
chime 
 You can listen up and can hear it for a
moment too as the breeze blows through a second
time Kiri makes the same sound 
 Looks like its a little bit northward of
where youre headed A little north
 I mean it could be
 Its loosely on the way If you trust it
We could avoid it though
 I dont know what the hell that is I
havent heard that out here before
 Are you sure about that
 Im helping you
 Thank you
 Sure You cause some of the swamp mass to
pull back a bit
 Frumpkin takes a little bit because this
terrain is not very conducive to prowling cats of
Frumpkins size But Frumpkin heads on for a bit
coming across the source of this sound You see
about  or so feet ahead in the direction
where you heard the sound hanging from one of the
branches there is indeed a cluster of carved
chimes that are dangling from a piece of twine
there Theyre banging into each other every now
and then when the breeze slowly comes through
 On a branch yeah
 You can give a perception check for
Frumpkin
  okay From Frumpkins view underneath
you can get a close look at it and the material
of the chimes isnt wood It appears to be
yellowed old dried hollowed bone The twine
itself is not twine It appears to have been
tanned or dried sinew
 Sinew
 Currently its just the one chime
 It doesnt catch your mind as anything that
is a defensive mechanism to undead that you would
recognize
 It is about seven feet above Frumpkin
 Okay
 Frumpkin manages to climb the tree using the
outside of the somewhat twisted bark getting to
the top From that viewing point as Frumpkin gets
out there you can 
 You do see from the top of the branch
beyond the edge of the fog there looks to be a
thick tree that has broken and fallen over about
ten feet from the base The heavy roots rise up
into this trunk that still stands about nine or
ten feet from the base of the swamp floor It
appears like there is a hollow carved into it
circular and a curtain that is currently pressed
bolted or nailed into it that is partially
blocking an opening into the tree
 Its hanging down and every now and then a
faint breeze comes through and you see it shift
ever so slightly But its a heavy material
 Okay As Frumpkin make a stealth check
 Okay Good to know
 It is better than 
 Frumpkin stalks up through avoiding the
sleight depressed elements of the floor that fill
with the thicker bog water Coming upon the
outskirts you can see the curtain that hangs is
not cloth It appears to be a scaled leatherlike
material Actually pretty similar to what you had
carved from the crocodile the day before But long
weathered and its dry towards the top but the
base of it seems to have been progressively
moistened by the swamp around it As such its
slightly decomposing and it has a bit of moss and
algae thats grown on it giving it a lighter
green at the tip Looking inside there is a layer
of bones that are all broken and chipped to the
point where its given a textured base to the
floor From this view youre not able to make out
what the bone source is or what theyre from But
there is a gentle layer of bones of varying
degrees of age to them Within there you also
see there is natural rot on the inside of this
trunk thats let it easily be carved away There
appears to be a matted pile of something in the
corner Other than that in the brief instant that
Frumpkins paying attention it appears to be empty
 Frumpkin returns to his realm
 You didnt get a good long look at them
You literally got in quickly and went 
 In the brief instant you looked in there
you got a few details in the interior before
pulling way
 Thats not true at all
 Its right here
 Its that way
 Thats what I said
 Yeah
 You continue moving on
 Febron goes All right That way and he
points in the direction and ushers you forward
 What pace are you moving at Normal pace
slow pace fast pace
 Okay medium pace it is
 You could You have to move at a slow pace
to move stealthily though
 For the most of it yeah
 As you continue on Febron and Beau are
you the other one with Febron doing the survival checks
 Make one more
 As you guys begin to watch the treeline
slowly thin Febrons like Oh its a good sign
Were getting very close to getting out of this
fucking swamp and getting next to the Ounterloch
thatll lead us there No issue no more of this
Right as hes saying that you watch him about to
step into another one of those open plants that
begins to quake and you watch as its about to
release this burst of pollen Beau
 You dont stop him you just point it out
It goes 
 He goes What  and starts
walking straight towards it
 Make an athletics check for you to try and
grapple him
 Acrobatics Sorry athletics for you to
grapple him
 You reach and grab him but he shrugs off
your arm and starts walking
on him and lift him up into the air He doesnt
step on it with the claw the green magic comes
out and  up into the air
 He continues to walk towards it and then
glides up in the air and is floating Hes
reaching towards it and the plant  and
is trying to reach for him
 Hes now floating and slowly rotating in the
air like 
in the air like Come on shake out of it come on
 It takes you the better part of a minute to
finally shake him out of it before he goes Oh
is it what Shit  Shit whats going
on
 The plants still below him going like

side Im getting tired of this
 You poke him and he begins to glide over
 The plant is now turning towards him slowly
shifting in his direction and hes like Backing
away theres a fucking
 Yeah you move around the side and you pull
him away
 You guys begin to pick up your pace This
plant is not very fastmoving and you even
moving at your slower pace it cant keep up with
you and it eventually gives up and disappears into
the fog behind you
 I love that you roll a  to see it before
him and and went Sure
 I love it its great
 Yeah All righty
 Ive been through it a few times but
usually its with a group of other smugglers and
they take care of me and protect me like you are
Thank you
 Make an insight check
 Its hard to read
 Okay
 You know I appreciate that I dont
appreciate you casting spells to fuck with all my
mind and shit But Ive been honest Im going to
make some honest coin and Im doing my fucking
best all right Now come on its this way
  Not north where were going
At this point you guys can see the very edge of
the water is now starting to show through the fog
and you can see where bits of the lake are hitting the
shoreline and you have reached the Ounterloch in
the middle of the Labenda Swamp
 Yeah
 I dont know I dont go into it I
recommend not getting too close just in case We
usually stay right on the coastal side of it you
know
 Perfect
 No whatre you doing No shit
 The whole time youre doing that Kiris
like  Whos keeping watch on this
 Yes
 I need you and probably Beau since you were
with Febron before make a perception check please
 Okay As you guys are trudging along on the
bank of this lake heading northward Fjord out
of the corner of your eye you see a shadow shift
in the trees to the left of you You glance back
and you see something disappear behind a tree
about   feet off
 To the left side
 So you guys are heading towards the shadow
you saw
 Fjord Molly and Yasha like that
 And Beau
 You begin to turn and approach and you guys
form your line moving forward You watch as
something lumbering moves Its still on the edge
of the fog and it shifts from the tree where it
was to a tree further back and then ducks behind
another tree Its not very stealthy though it
thinks it might be
 It seems to be moving fairly easily in the
terrain
 Okay make a stealth check
 Okay As you tiptoe through the edges
leaping from cluster of root to cluster of root
being as quiet as you can you come around the
first tree where this figure had vanished look
around to where its currently waiting and you see
two trees that grew together and a large rock
thats wedged at the base of it Crouched below
behind the rock you see this bulbous humanoid
creature with a deep greenblue skin tone with
little pustules and boils on it at the edges of
the shoulder and arm You see long stringy black
hair that goes past the front of the chest The
torso appears to be swollen this belly protruding
beyond it You can see hanging around the neck
other pieces of hollowed bone very similar to
that chime that you saw being described by Caleb
 It appears to be trollish in nature The
pustules and part of its body theres this thick
green liquid thats oozing out in places Its
sitting there clinging to the rock with its long
fingers clutching it looking over in the
direction of where you were breathing heavy
 It seems to be looking in the direction
where you were
 He doesnt see you at the moment no
 Youre about  feet from it
 You could certainly try
 Make a sleight of hand check to do so
without making a very visible toss
 You take the handful and lob them quietly
as far as you can You hear very faint impacts of
them about   feet off The trollish creature
goes  and pushes off the rock a bit
looking that direction Looks over the rock looks
back in that direction Its now looking like hes
paranoid and keeping tabs on both sides
 Make another stealth check
 You manage pull back to the rest of the
group as you guys are holding your line waiting
for Beau to return
  Youre a fan of pie

 Do you guys continue onward
 You are out in the open at the edge of
where the lake is beyond the treeline Being
stealthy here means being quiet but youre still
very much out in the open
 Im saying if an entity knows youre there
if youre not trying to obscure your visual
youre going to have a hard time avoiding it
 As you guys push on Febrons looking
extremely nervous now that youve mentioned this
creature Wait are you saying you saw this troll
thing Over there
 Only heard rumors and we talk about various
things that live out there trolls is definitely
one of them
 Through the ages there have been all sorts
of stories Theres uglier trolls here Swamp
trolls mountain trolls all types and this one
it wouldnt surprise me I havent seen one but I
stay perfectly quiet Quieter than you usually do
as a group Im just going to stay here and
clings behind you Fjord like as a shield
 You guys move on taking care to be quiet
but not out of sight If you want to be stealthy
in that regard make a stealth check
 So then no stealth
 So you guys continue pushing forward at your
regular pace
  Youre a cultist Youre a
cultist
word I dont like it
 Yasha and Fjord as theyre having this
conversation youre watching at the flanks and
you can see the shape of that troll creature is
still moving from tree to tree keeping pace with
your movement
 Its not approaching you but its keeping
pace
 Youre not in the center of the swamp where
its a lot of shifting topography and roots and
vines and patches of deep water you have to come
across Youre along the coast of this lake so
its mainly soggy dirt and sand so its not rough
terrain where you are
 Yes But you also have no protection Youre
literally out in the open
 Make a perception check
 You do not
 No because you dont know if this
creatures undead or not
 
  Its me Bren 
Pulls the dagger out
 If youre doing this stealthily then I need
anyone whos trying to not be seen to make a
stealth check
 Beaus stealthing to the north which will
be here Fjord you guys are heading inward
 Jester where are you standing
 You guys are heading northward this way You
guys have to go this way because the lakes all
this direction
 Nott and Kiri are back here and that would
be Go off to that side Febron is like Im
going to stay back here with the people in the
backback because I want to stay in the back
 You guys begin to trudge in deeper into the
swamp
 Yeah theyre pretty stale Youre fine As
you begin to move into the swamp you do see the
shape and its about maybe  or so feet from
where you are You watch it shift and then shift
to another tree a little further away
 Hes moving away from you
 Make a perception check
 You see one shape move its similar to the
one you saw before You can ascertain that it
probably is the same creature yeah
 Make a deception check No you dont need
to after that well see if he can see through the
illusion It skips ahead Just keeps walking in
that direction
  feet  feet gets relatively close to
where you saw the shape vanish
 From behind the tree one of the claws The
long stringy hair dangling somewhat stuck to its
neck shifting with the light breeze that blows
through as it looks back and watches the illusion
turn and shift Is it relatively close to the
tree the illusion
 It sits there and waits shifts
 It shifts back in its space a little bit
 As soon as it gets within about five or so
feet the illusion the troll creature reaches out
and swings out to grab the illusion passes
through and the claws  into the tree It
goes  and then vanishes behind
the tree You watch it dart the shadow of it
vanish behind another tree and its moving
further away from where you are
 How long does that last Lasts for a
minute
 You guys cluster together outside of the
swamp alongside the curvature of the lake keeping
an eye on the side you continue to travel
forward The lake slowly begins to as you guys
are heading northward along its side it begins to
curve to a northeastern direction and Febrons
like All right so this is good Were getting
closer to the northern side of the lake which
means were getting close to where we follow the
pearl blades to the safe house Good okay At
this point you look over to the side Whos
keeping a watch on this Okay both of you guys
roll a perception check please
  you said You do see the shape now
keeping pace with you again same distance out
there Its stalking you but its definitely
you get the sense based on the interaction you
had earlier and the distance its keeping its
not interested in fighting nine of you Its
waiting to pick one of you off and take it
wherever its going to take it Its smart enough
to know that its not going to jump into a fray in
the open space but its definitely waiting to see
what weaker one stays to the back
 You guys continue heading in a northeastern
direction until eventually you watch the lake come
to a northern peak and begin to curve back into a
southern area It looks like the top of the lake
bends to a point northward and then begins to head
southward and level out At this point Febron
goes All right good From here we head
northward into the swamp Were looking for
daggers with pearl hilts in the trees Those are
the markers theres six of them that lead us
there Hes going to make a perception check He
looks a bit lost someone want to help him out
with this
 Make a perception check as well
 It takes you a moment but you manage to
catch the third or fourth tree into the
treeline and you see a gleaming pearlhilted
dagger that is jammed about five feet off the
ground into one of the thicker pieces of tree bark
on the exterior of one of these trees Its this
little mark that looks like someone jammed a
whittling knife into it and left it there and he
goes Thats one good Okay that means were
going the right way
 Moving up looking for the next one Go
ahead and roll
 Both of you go There at the same time
 All right second one Moving on looking
for the third
 This one takes a little longer to find All
right
 Yeah You find the third Febron finds the
fourth
 Fifth one because he did not find it but
you locate it
 Yeah With that point he goes Okay Im
pretty sure were almost there He points ahead
and you can see where theres a cluster of trees
A new sight catches your attention The first
thing that hits you is this faint scent of rotting
flesh It hits your nose a bit and your eyes
sting water for the moment As your vision
focuses on the first corpse a human man propped
up on a spear going up through the side of his
torso and out his left pectoral His stomach is
bloated and his skin is dull gray and glistening
His jaw hangs open his expression this horrible
ghastly grimace A few feet from him stuck to one
of the trees you see a halfling woman with two
blades jammed through her shoulders pinning her
up legs dangling but one leg is partially torn
off Her head is mounted down hair in her face so
you cant make out any features and theyre both
placed up there right against this opening to a
small clearing ahead and this is where Febron
goes And thats what Im talking about Thats
the warning Whoever did this is trying to keep us out
 Fuck no
 From what youre looking at theyre both
about as fresh as the other
 They both have their jaws intact From what
you can tell the female halfling you cant make
out the features of the face because the hair is
in the way and dangling The other ones is open
 They both look pretty dead
 Make an investigation check
 No traps nothing like that You do notice
there are wounds across the body Beyond the leg
missing there are a number of wounds You can
make a medicine check to try and ascertain what they are
 Okay They seem to be a combination of bite
and claw marks Not super deep slashing but
definitely a gash across the shoulder the neck
There is one large puncture wound about that wide
thats right around where the sternum is But
whatever punctured it one of the edges is torn
out like something hooked was placed in and then
pulled through dragging the flesh with it
 Intact
 No you do not recognize this person
lifeless You do see some rough elements of
tattoos along the neck similar to the banded neck
tattoos of members of The Gentlemans crew that
you had seen before Not as thick and dense but
you can see that there is a pattern to the
acquisition of some of these tattoos for the ones
who run the smuggling line Youre starting to
ascertain and put that together but intact
 Kiri pulls a blade and gets behind Cali and
is like  Ive never done this before
  Be careful
 You watch as a tiny dagger goes into the tree
next to it and Kiris around Calis going
 
 As the chest breathes in some of the air
escapes some of the wounds and theres bits of matter
 The head settles down and looks right
 Febron leaps back hes like Shit and
backs up a little bit He looks really
uncomfortable with this whole thing You dont
think he was prepared for any sort of deadraising
circumstance Is this fucking necromancy
 He keeps backing away Now the corpses face
of this halfling woman turns towards you

  Swamp fishmen 
from under the ground
 Many
 Weeks Two maybe three
 We cut when we could They bleed but too
many
 Kiri comes up and grabs the dagger wedges
it out of the tree and turns to Cali and goes
 If it bleeds we can kill it Points
it back to the corpse
 Febron
 Hes  feet behind you Hes keeping a
little back from the whole undead thing
 At which point from behind one of the trees
 the troll reaches out and grabs him by
the torso pulls him back and you hear him scream
as the troll grabs him tucks him under his arm
 and begins leaping away from you
 Okay go for it Make an attack
 You go running
  All righty
 Let me get the
 That is the troll
 This is the opening of the clearing here
where you guys were talking to the halfling that
was stapled to the tree right there
 Essentially yeah You guys all spin and
watch this happening Kiris over by the edge of
the tree with you and Caleb where were you
 You would have probably been over here near
Nott
 Technically this would be north
 Yes that areas north
 Yes What did you roll
 That did miss
 Nice
throw for the Acid Splash
 The troll spins and goes running with Febron
going  in its grasp it starts
lumbering leaping from tree to tree Its legs
while it has this bulbous swollen midsection
these thin froglike legs are giving these fairly
decent leaps from section to section its other
arm grasping onto the trees as it runs You can
see this is definitely its home terrain As these
magic missiles swarm out and slam into its body
with each impact that green ichor sprays across
Febron and it starts to burn into his skin Hes

 Febron goes limp

 I rolled d I rolled eight on each of
them That was the reaction there
as well if you dont mind
 Correct Thats a four
 Seven points of acid got it As it slams
it begins to burn the back of the skin You watch
a bit of steam rise off of its shoulder It
definitely is wounding the creature This large
swollen troll is still making a break I need
everyone to roll initiative now
  to 
  to 
 Nott and Molly  to ten
 Ten to five
 Eight
 Ashley its incredible
 Is that everybody I think so yeah Top of
the round as its bounding behind with an
unconscious guide under its arm Jester youre up
first
 All righty
 What type of damage is it
 Which he does not make he rolled a 
 Six points of damage As the energy
coalesces and the bell  in the range of
this creature it impacts it and it staggers for a
second and the pustules on its body emit more of
that poison
 That finishes your go Cali youre up
combat erupt you see her twitch a little bit and
she snarls a little Im going to rush up  feet
move up as much as I can Get back here now Im
going to Quickened Spell False Life on myself
actually no Ill just do it as a normal action
I wont Quickened Spell it Ill do False Life on
myself and gain some vigor as a stlevel spell
 Cool This strange barrier of arcane energy
forms around Calis body giving this little
essence of vigor and the body swells a bit That
finishes your turn Nott youre up
 Within  feet you can stop about there
 Go for it
 Yeah that hits
 Technically no because hes aware that you
were there and is not currently flanked by any allies
 Five points of piercing damage It strikes
and sticks into the back and more of that green
stuff begins to spray out of the wound where it
hit in the vicinity Its creating bursts of this
toxic sludge thats oozing from its body around it
each time youre hitting it
  That does not hit It manages to hit the
tree thats near it and sticking into that one there
 Theres quite a bit of it on Febron
actually
 Yes you are
 Id say in this clearing youre not in
terribly difficult terrain Youre moving around
okay its not too bad The further you get into
it this way it starts getting a little more
like in the cluster of trees in here it starts
getting a harder to move in
 That ends Notts turn Molly youre up
 Okay That is a  What is it wisdom
  Your DC on that is Its charismabased
right This is your racial
 It succeeds its a ten Unfortunately That
would have stopped it in its tracks
 Is that your turn Do you want to move
closer
 Okay so you move up to there
 Okay that finishes Mollys go Beau and
Fjord you guys are up
  You do you get right up into its
body
 They both hit
 Great
 What else are you doing
 Oh nice
 All right 
 That is a plus five on its constitution
saving throw Trolls man It resists the stunning strike
 You still have your bonus though
 Ten damage Third strike
 Okay cool You rush forward slamming into
it with your staff and your fists striking into
its body With each impact it takes you a moment
to realize whats happening but that spray is
covering your face and as it does the venom is
pushing into your flesh and burning upon contact
 You take nine points of poison damage You
take another nine points of poison damage You
take  points of poison damage A total of
sorry  nine and nine so thats   points
of poison damage
  sorry
 Febron by the way Fucking dead You see
now hes coated in this toxin The eyes are open
and now pouring out of his mouth is foam at the
edge with his tongue lolling out Yeah as it was
fleeing all the impacts covered him with the same
toxic stuff and sent him straight to his grave
 That ends Beaus turn Fjord what are you
doing
 All right Two attacks on it
 That hits
 Both hit
 Woo nice Both parts of its back where they
impact the flesh tears open revealing the muscle
beneath and as it does more of it sprays
Beau
 You take five points of poison damage
 Correct
 It was  plus  so its 
 You just took another  points of poison
damage
 Beau falls onto the ground arms limp
covered in this toxic substance That ends your
turn Fjord
 Okay so it is now the trolls turn The
troll does not regenerate because you did acid
damage to it with your last attack which prevents
it from regaining any hit points
 However its still currently clutching the
body of Febron under its arm Its going for a
straight bolt it looks down and sees Beau
unconscious uses its action to pick Beau up under
the other arm
 Nope Now its going to use its full
movement Thats  it is right where the marker
is right there
 Yeah this is a pickle guys
 That ends the trolls turn Caleb youre
up
 Right there is when you start getting to
rough terrain so thats as far as you get which
the troll is not affected by youve noticed that
its in its home turf
 What are you doing Caleb
 Magic Missile on its head
 Okay Go ahead and roll for the damage on
that
 Okay You are now holding concentration on
Haste Nott you feel suddenly the world slows
ever so slightly and you feel this burst of
adrenaline in your body
 Thats your turn
 Yasha youre up
 Dont forget if you rage and dont attack
or are attacked by the end of your next turn you
lose your rage
 So if youre not planning to attack it or
if theres not going to be something attacking
you youre losing a rage for the day so keep
that in mind
by something
 Its either attack or be attacked you dont
have to take damage necessarily
 So its taking damage So its you attacking
or taking damage
 Yeah Unfortunately youre starting to get
through some sludge
 You can yeah
 All right
 Thats as close as you can get right there
 You are
 You dont have an action to use it anymore
unfortunately
 Yeah What do you yell I give you two bonus
actions
 Make an intimidation check
 Well its charismabased but depending on
the intimidation you can use your strength
modifier instead
 Okay with your strength modifier
 It makes sense and its how we did it in
the last campaign too Its one of the rules that
they say you can use for your campaign Charisma
or strength for your intimidation because it makes
sense for you
 My favorite Pike line by the way in
Pillars Of Eternity
  all right
 Okay it turns around and glances at you and
it looks shaken Ill say for the purposes of
this its frightened of you until the end of your
next turn
 Yeah
 Does that finish your turn Yasha
 Unfortunately
 Its now Kiris turn Kiri holding a
dagger
 She just holds the dagger Thats Kiris
turn
 And shouts  Fuck Jester
its your turn
 Yeah youre within  feet
 Oh shit Okay
 So you are conscious
 Okay so when we come to your turn you
can do that You come to consciousness and youre
like  and your body hurts theres all
this stinging from the toxin burning your skin and
flesh Youre chucked under and you can feel the
claws digging into part of your thigh and side as
youre being run along by this giant troll
creature It smells awful this heavy scent
of rotting citrus and fungus thats permeating
from its body That finishes your turn Jester
 That was your bonus you still have your
action
 Sacred Flame
 You got it Holding there Cali youre up
terrain Can I get next to Yasha
 You can get that close right now with the
speed of  feet yeah
twitches a little bit Come on Quickened Levitate
on Beau Im going to try and lift Beau up If
theres a tree line above Im going to try and
fling her up to the tree line
 Interesting For the purposes of this make
an arcana check and this is going to be your
attempt to break the grapple of the troll
 Ten Not very good at arcana
 Two Fucking Youre a lucky son of a bitch
It has a plus four on its strength roll
 Ripping from the grip of the troll Beau
gets lifted into the air and is now hovering there
 Yeah You can do that
 Beau is now lifted up into the tree Youre
just within reach of branches when it comes to
your turn
 Im going to be honest you almost killed
her man Scorching Ray if those all had hit
Beaus dead I was like oh fuck
 I got real nervous Magic Missile would have
done the same too because its a splash per
missile
 Go for it Dex save for you Natural  and
then for you dex save as well That is an eight
 Yes
 Splashes out No one is close enough to be
impacted by the effect
 Febrons dead Febrons like
 Kind of His arms and legs are dangling
behind as its dragging him through Its pretty rough
 Not beyond anything else
 Ending Calis turn Nott youre up
 Currently no
 Thats as close as you can get right there
Thats not quite within  feet
 For water walking right Ill say for that
purpose it does give you the extra movement
there So now youre just within  feet
 Wisdom save is a  Whats your DC
  it fails It immediately falls prone
laughing with the corpse of Febron being flailed
about in the air as its spinning The legs and
arms
 Well technically you can only do the bonus
action to attack if you use the attack action
 Oh Because youre hasted Thats right
Sorry I was thinking of the bonus action youre
correct
 That hits
 No because you do not have advantage on the
attack unfortunately
 Nice
 It sinks into it
 You do because its an attack action
 Okay that hits To two Oh man that
sucks
 Seven points of damage That finishes your
turn Nott well done On the ground youre firing
both of those Theyre sticking inside these
sprays of poison toxin out of his body as its
laughing on the ground For Tashas Hideous
laughter does it get a chance to break
 Nope that was a two
 The second roll was a  so it succeeds It
fell prone gave you disadvantage on the attacks
and then got out of your spell Lesson learned
 But it is prone That finishes your turn
Nott Molly
 Right here
 It rolled a three minus one so it succeeds
It takes what type of psychic damage
 Interesting okay so psychic damage strikes
it and it does not spray the venomous toxin upon
receiving the psychic damage But it is grabbing
its head now the laughter has subsided
 Its trying to get back to its feet That
finishes your turn Molly
 Beau youre up in the trees Fjord youre
on the ground
 Youre levitating
 Sure you still have the levitation spell on
you so if you were to leap youd just glide
 Okay so youre on the branch there
  just hits
 When it is prone you have disadvantage so
roll again to attack Its a ranged attack
  just misses It sinks into the swamp mud
next to it
 One more time because this has disadvantage
 Okay so that does hit roll damage on the
second one
 That is correct
 Ten
 Four plus
 Damage bonus
 Eight thats what I thought Eight points
of damage The shuriken sinks into its chest
another spray of toxin Nothing in the vicinity to
take the damage that finish your turn
 You do
 No its only unarmed I think thats your
turn
 Fjord youre up
 Go for it Disadvantage on each strike
 They both go passing right over its body as
its trying to get up It slips for a second and
what wouldve hit it ducks out of the way just in
time and both of them arc off hitting nothing
 That finishes your turn Its now the
trolls turn It gets up half its movement and
its going to run  feet this way and then a full
action run for another  feet and its darting
off with the corpse of Febron under its arm It
has its prize and its running off into the swamp
Its hurting but youre watching its flesh stitch
together a little more and starting to heal up
from some of the wounds
 Is anybody pursuing
 All right go ahead and roll for that
 Nope The Fire Bolt vanishes beyond its
space there Anybody else with a ranged attack
that wants to try and make it
 Go for it
 At this range it is
  misses Its starting to hit the mist and
its form is starting to become a little harder to see
and its running with such an intense speed
 You do And a bonus action attack if you
want to
  No just misses
 Roll damage It does strike
 Eight points of damage It manages to catch
it Its still running Fjord youre the only one
with a proper ranged attack here if you want to
try
 Go ahead and roll damage
 It gets blasted Still going
 Well now it takes its next turn to do a
full foot run
 At this point the fact that you guys are
having a hard time hitting it and the rate that
its healing youre starting to think
 Yeah
 Im just saying you can continue to pursue
if you want to
 You guys are right at the edge of where
these bodies have been propped up as a warning
which from what Febron told you was placed up
to prevent people from coming towards the safe house
 Youre starting to get close to it as far
as you know
 As you approach the head is tracking you the
whole time
 The head curves off to the right between the
tree that its stapled to and the other body
thats propped up  feet that way
 You dont see any safe house You dont see
anything like that At that point the head 
continues back
 Looks to be two shortswords have been jammed
into it
 Shortswords
 Make an investigation check
 Okay Rummaging through the pockets and the
various baubles you can find you find four pieces
of gold a handful of about  silver this is on
the halfling a charm looks like its made from
a dried animal foot of some kind like a dog or a
coyote
 
 And a note thats keeping track of
locations but its mostly soaked now and the ink
has all run and you make out bits of words here
and there but it makes no sense to you
 Yeah the paper is now dry and a full piece
of paper but the ink is still as smeared and lost
as it was before
 The few words you make out involve a time
One of them says two hours past the noon sun
thats the most you make out of one sentence Part
of its smeared Its like Steve Martin in The
Jerk trying to read the love letter 
The other things you can make out are four men
required and then another one saying something
about Shady and thats all you make out
 Okay well take a short rest here and while
were doing that well also take a break Restroom

Back into the game we go
 Ugh 
 Indeed Bringing us back into the game You
guys have taken your short rest healed up a bit
and recovered from the chaos of the swamp you
managed to trudge through Youve lost your guide
but youve survived thus far The rest of you at
least What would you like to do Oh you were casting
 Yes
 Utilizing Detect Magic you were saying
 On
 Nothing magical within what was found on the
bodies no
 Correct
 No at this point its later afternoon
maybe Its like two or three oclock
 Maybe
 You left early enough in the day where you
arent threatened for dusk for another few hours
You guys continue on past the tree
 Make an investigation check
traces on my bracelet
 Thats true
 Outside of the space around you or the
trinkets found within the corpses nothing But
you do see the mild glow from the bracelet on
Calis arm
 Make a religion check
 You can make a religion check if you want to
try and recall information
  Youve heard of the Scaled Tyrant You
dont know a whole lot of information But you
know through your research that one of the
entities that partook in elements of the Calamity
 No Not at all Is definitely considered one
of the betrayer gods in the Calamity though very
selfish and is considered by many to be the
patron whether it be the mother of or the
patron of chromatic dragons
nice to me but she would torture and kill people
in her name
 At this point Nott has completed quite a
thorough sweep of the vicinity as you move
forward No traps You do notice as you head into
this next open clearing theres thick patches of
vines and roots that descend into a circular space
that is awash with swamp water and general bog rot
that is floating over the surface like a moat has
formed naturally around this giant banyan tree
about  or  feet across from side to side It
is gargantuan The roots rise up and merge at
different places where the tree itself begins to
expand about ten feet up before it reaches out and
curves and carves into the earth before
disappearing beneath the water the still awful
swamp water that surrounds it You also see
across the front of its trunk in the vicinity at
least the bits where the sunlight comes through
from the rather choked boughs above that are
shading the area quite heavily six more bodies
tied to branches and roots with rope and vine
Their bodies covered with similar wounds as the
ones you inspected before Some are slumped
against the base of the roots Some are held up
and vines wrapped around them and they are stapled
at an angle onto the sides of the tree Theyre
all currently placed as a warning to either notify
or fend off anyone who would wander too close
 Nope
 You can part areas of it but its about 
feet across as far as the width of it and it
changes in width depending on which place on the
tree you head It is essentially a waistdeep
area of water So you could move with it and
still has water but it shrink it down five feet
so its not as deep to walk through
 You can bring it to just past knee height
within a very localized area to you
sorry
 Kind of Theres a big clearing around this
tree Its natural for the most part but it looks
like this area is centered around the tree
 Make a perception check
 Well no you havent submerged in the water
yet But it looks about waist high as you lower
the water level
 You do glance up and see a band of teal
fabric tied around one of the branches or the
edges of the roots at the top part about ten feet
up that has been weathered and dirtied from just
being there for a long time A lot of the color
has faded But you just barely pick out its location
 It looks like it might have been a bandana
that was wrapped and tied around a root above
 Okay So you wade through the water
 Beau make an athletics check to try and
climb the tree
 Athletics To climb the tree
 It takes a while to even get close but the
general moisture in the air makes it slick and you
keep slipping down the side
 You can try Roll
 A tiny piece of teal fabric tied
 Eight to ten feet up
  Do you untie it
 Okay You pull it and you bring it down
Its an old starched weathered bandana
 About three feet
 Oh yeah so now the waters clear and you
can see below theres thick sediment muck a few
bones of some wayward creature that long has been
left to rot beneath the water but theres nothing
living in there aside from toads tadpoles other
small slithering natural creatures that call the swamp home
first You guys were kind enough to bring me Im
happy to step through and make sure its okay Ill start
 Okay so you make your way through catching
up to Beau and Fjord who are at the base of the
tree You get up to the base of the tree now The
rest of you guys follow suit
 You all cross past the water path Youre
now at the base of the tree You Nott have the
strange teal faded scarf now in your grasp
 Yeah
 The gif machine
 The gif machine Sam Riegel
 Oh god The branch itself is pretty sturdy
The portions of the tree here do not bend very
much and it doesnt seem to react The strength of
the Mage Hand isnt very strong
 Make an investigation check
  Yeah You glance around and as you were
placing your hands against part of it some of it
shifts it wobbles Now getting a glance theres
a piece of weathered driftwood or separate wood
that has been pressed up and tucked behind some of
the roots to look like its part of the tree But
its a little bit of a different texture a
different type of wood and as you press on it it
wiggles You shift it
 Make an investigation check
  It does not appear to be trapped
 You wiggle it out pull it free and now you
can see about a fourfoot carved hollow in the
tree that leads to a dark lightless interior
 All right It glows like a torchlight in the
vicinity
 As you step inside Fjord you notice a
fairly wellcleared interior that smells of marsh
water and lamp oil Glancing about there are two
hooks on the wall that have been jammed in that
carry the top part of some sort of oil lantern
that has been shattered against the wall The
glass itself is broken The metal is bent and you
now can see theres some soaked lamp oil that has
fallen from those impacts that has hit the ground
on the wall nearby and is offering that additional
smell to the room The floor is somewhat soggy
with moss and bits of sand and gravel as well as
the occasional heavy root that breaks through the
surface of that soft floor There are some pieces
of broken wood slats but besides that the
chamber appears to be empty
 Okay Youre now stepping into the chamber
The chambers about  feet wide Its just round
 You look up The ceilings about  feet
tall and theres some hanging roots that are
dangling from the top It looks like its been
carved away maybe
 No It matches the size Its probably about
two feet to three feet of thickness of the actual
tree trunk and the interiors hollow
 No Make an investigation check if you want
to
 Okay A couple things Though you dont have
a sense of color are you the only one in the
chamber right now
 You went in there as well
 Right The rest of you guys step into the
chamber and the light comes in What you failed to
see because it was a change of color becomes
immediately apparent There are scattered splashes
of blood across areas of the walls inside Theyre
dried but dried enough to the point where they
havent gone completely black and then
disintegrated So this is relatively recent weeks
maybe As you guys are inspecting the space there
are certain gashes against it looks like there
was definitely a fight and scuffle The soft
ground here has signs of turbulent movement as
well as a number of smeared grooves in the ground
that snake and spiral about
 Fjord as youre glancing about answering
this question you look down on the far north
corner of it and where some of the roots have
gathered and come down theres one space where
you dont see the wall of the tree behind it As
you move the root out of the way there is an
actual hole about two and a half feet wide that
descends below the tree
 There are some spatters of blood and there
are some things that give the sign of being pulled
on as well as pieces and shards of wood including
bits of porcelain some object that had shattered
and broken Looks like whatever may have been
within this chamber at some point a lot of its
been brought down there
 Make an investigation check
 You do manage to pull through You do see a
small piece of thick scaled hide that was carved
off probably as part of a scuffle
 Its pretty tough
 Its salty
 Recognize any of the bodies
 Okay Glancing past and taking a look
theres nobody that youve seen before that is
amongst this crew They all appear to be darkly
dressed generally to keep out of sight You do
see two of the members there that have an
accumulation of neck tattoos Youve seen the ones
back in Zadash that were almost full bands of
designs These individuals have only sections of
it You start getting the idea that the more
theyve worked with whatever organization that
work this is the more completion theyve had of
certain jobs depending on what the job is a
certain type of individual acquires tattoos as a
sign of how long theyve been there and how
successful theyve been
 At one point possibly
 Investigation check
 With disadvantage because its quick
 Whats that
 Okay
  You manage to scrape away about  gold
pieces and five silver pieces
 Before as you pull off of it you watch as
the lower half of the body sloughs off the torso
and you back away
 The smell is awful as a lot of the interior
gas of the bloated corpse escapes into this
terrible sulfurous stench
 Okay You take a moment to focus and place
your hand on this lightly thrumming device Your
vision is pulled into this universal space of
stars and gas and distant existences youve never
contemplated and there you see before you the
pulsing light of possibility You reach out a hand
and grasp it and feel it enter your body and
youve acquired your fragment of possibility
just point over there and shes like
 The hole has chunks of rock and dirt as well
as a very interwoven network of roots coming down
from the tree so its fairly easy to climb down
There is a little bit of that damp water and
moisture that seeped into the chamber previously
from just being near the swamp It wasnt a thick
layer of water maybe half an inch or so in the
actual portions of the chamber and some of it is
now heading down As youre climbing down
carefully through this hole you can feel it
running down your back and its this cold swamp
water I need you to make an athletics check as
you make your way down this chamber
 Yep Just add your athletics
 Seven Okay You begin to  and you
lose your grip and begin slide down like a slide
  You get about maybe  or so feet
before the back of the slide leaves you You have
darkvision so you see the interior of some sort
of chamber in the ground rocketing towards you
 Okay And you gingerly land on your feet No
damage taken And no noise made either
 Looking around you you see the inside of a
natural rock chamber You can hear in the distance
a rummaging sound some shifting over from around
the corner It seems like from where youre
landing the back is around you and then it curves
to the left You see a faint puddle before you
lose vision and beyond that you dont see
anything but you hear 
 Just echoing around the side
 You hear a 
 Something clatter to the ground What are
the rest of you guys doing
 I dont think you heard anything no
 Make a stealth check for me please
 You slowly make your way around the side
This chamber appears to be kidney shaped It
curves around the bend and as you make your way
around the chamber at the outskirts of your
darkvision you begin to make out three shapes
Humanoid torsos with long fins that extend from
where the elbows are patchwork leather and bronze
armor pieces as well as hints of shell jewelry
and bone You can see one face as you peek around
the edge and you can see this large toothy
underbite with this square jaw where these four
tendrils kind of dangle from the tip of its chin
A single fin curves over the top of its head No
nose but two gleaming eyes that refract What
little bit of light coming into the chamber from
something out of the visual range is giving off a
faint glow The lower half of its body is a long
fish tail It looks like that a nightmareish
merman would look like It sits there clutching
some sort of long harpoonlike pike with a hook on
the end of it
 Theyre talking amongst themselves and you
hear some sort of tearing sound you peek around a
little further and you can see a creature has
been dragged down here A familiar one A thick
leatheryscaled body of a crocodile of some kind
Not a large one but a regular sized crocodile has
been dragged down here and all three of them are
in the process of feasting on its body Theyre
tearing into its flesh and talking amongst
themselves in a language you dont understand
Around the base of them you see broken crates and
a few odds and ends are
resting on the ground loosely discarded
 From what you can see Youre kind of
peeking around the corner you cannot see the
opposite end of where this curvature is without
possibly revealing yourself
 Around that way Not terribly There are a
few outcropping walls and at this point I would
say I could probably give you a visual
 Nott youre right there curving around the
side
 You landed right here and then made your way
around This is where it drops you into the middle
of the chamber
 Okay So whos going down
 Yeah they can most of them Make an
acrobatics check for me
 Sure
 The cats acrobatics
 Frumpkin lands
 Okay
 Double knot All right
 All right You make your way down the rope
Eventually you get to the bottom It does dangle
and the edge of the rope does basically end
about a foot or two above where the ground is So
you just manage to catch the bottom So put how
many ropes together Two  feet ropes Oh so no
Its actually coiled at the bottom Total its
about a foot way down You manage to make you
way down without an issue
 Okay So with the rope and everything
aiding you down here its easy enough for you all
to make your way into this area
 Kiris coming down with you
 Are you guys having this conversation
 
  I killed people
 
  Dont move unless something
chases you
  Right
 Holds the dagger in front of her
 Yeah so Kiri is going to go ahead and duck
into this corner here
 All right what are you guys doing
 Nott youre watching
 You hear the splashing of water and out from
the side another one emerges from this side pool
It  The other one speaking in
Aquan It turns around and splashes back into
this little pool and vanishes below the surface
 Briefly chatting but in the process of
eating more than anything
thats the amount I can do
 Its about ten square feet
how much I can freeze
 Everyone make a stealth check
 What was the number you rolled
 Okay so thats six
 As theyre all eating and Nott youre
paying attention one goes inquisitive growl
garbled speech
 All right So you throw the ball bearings
and then everyone rolls initiative You lost the
surprise round unfortunately You were spending
too much time talking
  to  anybody
  to 
 Okay so we have Beau Fjord what did you
get  And then Molly at   to ten
 And then what was it Caleb and Nott
 All right Ten to five
 Jester and Cali
 No Kiris staying in the back All right
thats everybody Top of the round as all three
of them have spun around apparently aware that
something is lurking in this area of it
 No but its not an ambush round So Top of
the round is Beau youre up
 You cant hold your turn You can hold an
action
 All the bad stealth checks were
 Ten right Okay got it
 Depending on what your action trigger is
yeah
 Over here next to Nott
 Yeah you can do that
 Okay And youre holding your action in case
Fjord attacks something
 Okay So as youre pulling back with that
Fjord
 All right Well youre going to be out in
the open Just so youre aware All right So you
move over here You can now see all three right
there
 Yeah thats as far as you can move there
They all turn  You see some of them
holding what looks to be these large
harpoontrident things that are hooked on the end
and they have some sort of thick cabling of some
kind attached to the end of it
 foot radius Where do you want to place
it
 You got it So you watch suddenly as the
back end of that chamber well for those who can
see which Caleb currently its mostly dark
except for that faint faint glow around the
corner that you dont see the source Theres no
light in here That light goes out You are blind
at the moment because what little bit of light
there is has been consumed by this sphere of
darkness that Fjord has summoned on the opposite
side of the chamber You watch as reality tears
open in that space and you see these strange
blackpurple otherworldly tentacles whip out from
the outside of it and you hear this horrible
slithering sound within the center of that
chamber with this faint underlying of whispers
and chanting
 Does that do immediate damage or only on
their turn
 Cool all right So that ends your turn
there Molly youre up
 Let me see here real fast about the Hunger
of Hadar spell
 All right So you cannot see anything You
have your goggles on
 Correct But you have Darkvision
 Correct So Ill say you can see where they
are but its a little obscured so
 You are Well no Im sorry you cannot
move You did your move so you have to have an
action so you can only attack that one that you
can see there
 Okay Theyre at disadvantage because its
beyond your foot initial range
 That does hit yeah
 Nope Disappears into the darkness
 You had to do that on your turn Youve only
got an action you were holding Sorry
 Its about ten  feet Its not very
high
 All right that ends Fjord and Beaus turn
Molly
 This one over here
 Oh I see There we go
 You still have a bonus if you want to
 All right Did you activate one of your
scimitars
 Got it cool That ends your turn It is now
their turn So top of the round theyre both in
the space so they take how much damage
 d cold damage
 You do So roll all at once
  You hear this strange slamming and
slithering sound and hissing noises on the inside
All righty so this ones going to go ahead and
move just to the edge there
 This guy gets to about there actually
before he can move into the water Right now
because they dont have a huge movement on land
 Exactly So those guys are clustered there
That guy does manage to move
 Hes going to continue slithering the rest
of the way 
Ill say it gets him to about there
 Well its not the end of their turn yet
 The two while still blinded saw you
emerge The one over on this end is going to go
ahead and attempt to throw one of its harpoons in
your direction Its blinded so it has
disadvantage on the attack
 With disadvantage thats a  Whats your
armor class
 Aw slick It shoots through and you deflect
it with the shield and watch it spark off The one
behind it is going to throw as well Natural one
yeah It chucks the harpoon Both of them land on
the ground and you hear them scrape as theyre
pulled back to where they are The one that is
right there in front of you is going to throw
another harpoon Its going to throw a harpoon at
you Still at disadvantage That is a  to hit
 You suffer as it jams and pierces into your
abdomen right past the armor sticking a couple
inches into your chest You take  points of
piercing damage and I need you to make a strength check
 Natural  You get dragged right up into
its space right there Make a constitution saving
throw to see if you can maintain concentration on
your spell
 Make a constitution saving throw
 So you succeed that one Now its pulled you
in Its going to go ahead and make a bite attack
against you as it pulls you in Its jaw opens up
to strike you That is an  to hit
 Because you have  armor You take seven
points of piercing damage as it digs its jaws
right into the front of your chest and shoulder
area biting down Make another
constitution saving throw
 You maintain concentration of the spell
Now all three of them have to make a dexterity
saving throw or receive the damage again That is
a fail a fail and a fail Two ten and a three
 Nice That ends their turn That brings us
to Yasha
  You cant quite get up into his space
Youre ten feet away
 You can use an action to dash if you want to
make the rest of the movement but you wont have
an action on your turn
 If you dont take damage by the end of your
next turn then yeah
 Unless you move into the tentacle range
 You can Youre going to hold for what
 Okay Holding your attack just in case it
comes in range That ends your turn Yasha Nott
and Caleb youre up with Jester and Cali on
deck
 Okay
 Does your cat have darkvision
 No it does not
 The first area but nothing beyond that
space
 You got it Beau has swollen to an enlarged
state
 Beau takes up this entire space now
 At a tenfoot ceiling Beau you suddenly
crouch Youre now hunched forward with the top of
it grinding against the top of your head and
shoulders
 If he hits its sneak attack He doesnt
get advantage so it misses unfortunately
  does hit
 It does yes
  points of damage All righty That ends
your turn
 Yeah you can Right over there
 Jester and Cali
 There
 There you go
 There you go All righty Thats your turn
Jester
 About  about there
as the draconic eye she brushes the hair out of
the way She focuses on the one fighting Fjord
and a sickly green beam will shoot out of the eye
and Im going to cast Ray of Sickness
 All righty

  hits
 Six
damage and its poisoned until the end of my turn
 Great Its poisoned until the end of your
next turn As the bolt hits it the veins all of a
sudden go dark on its torso where it impacts
things You start seeing a little bit of becomes
a bit more draconic
 Ending Calis turn Beau youre up
 Jester went She Invoked Duplicity
 Enlarged Beau is crouching down
 You can
 This giant foot right next to you Nott as
Beaus large form almost stomps on you
  that hits
 That misses
 Ten damage with your staff As you rush up
crouching low you take the staff and jam it down
into it It looks back at you It sees you looming
by As it pulls up its harpoon to try and defend
you jam the staff into its chest shove it to the
ground under the water and hear a crunch as you
collapse its ribcage with the impact
 Its taken the brunt of your damage
 The harpoon fell out of the wound Its
loose on the ground Theres a pretty nice
puncture wound through your armor and your body
right there
 You sure can So you take it and you fling
it into the darkness and it 
 Youve already used your action to do your
attack
 Bonus actions an unarmed strike so this is
a flavor as you throw it into the darkness that
they cant see You hear its body
 You were but there was nothing to hit
thats unarmed in your face You do fling it in
there and you hear this horrible slurping sound
as whatever
 And you were And whatever tear in reality
that was opened by Fjords patron devours the
corpse Its plucked out of the air and sucked
through whatever small rip in reality had opened
 Sure All right that ends your turn Fjord
youre up
 Okay that ends your turn
 You did have a little bit more yeah
 You could have yeah
 You can scoot all the way up to here if you
want
 Youre squatmoving your way through the
cavern
 Molly what do you got
 You got it Its now their turn Top of the
turn they take d damage so go ahead and roll that
 Got it You hear  and 
sound on the inside of this darkened sphere This
guy manages to get into the water and poke his way
through but just barely get his vision out This
guys going to come out as well and encounter Beau
on that element Theyre both still inside
 Theyre still inside And another one
arrives here and can only move there
 He will yes This one here is technically
right in range of Fjord and is going to unleash
two strikes on you Its claws and its melee bite
Actually I could melee with a harpoon so its
going to attempt to harpoon you and bite you
Natural  on the harpoon and then for the bite
attack thats going to be a 
 The harpoon is going to be  points of
piercing damage as it jams right into your chest
pushing you against the wall Go ahead and make a
concentration check if you dont mind You have
to beat 
 Its going to attempt to bite you in the
face The bite it actually hit Thats going to
be a d Thats eight points of piercing damage
 Where did my dice go There it is No the
Snitch fell away I need to keep it
 It did
 All righty so make a second concentration
check
 s fine you maintain concentration The
other one thats right next to Beau is going to
attempt to also throw its harpoon at you since it
saw that you were the source of this Theyre
trying to break the spell
 You were holding an attack Youll have to
say that
 Youre amplifying it
 Okay go for it So roll the damage thats
disadvantage on that
 Thats a  to hit Whats your armor
class
  It still hits the first strike The
harpoon  into you Thats going to be 
points of piercing damage
 You can While this is happening roll a
concentration check
 And make a strength check for me please
  on its side
 You get dragged  feet through the water
into range with it Beau you make your Sentinel
Strike on it
 Natural  nice Go ahead and
 The dice of the enlarged is also doubled
too
  points of damage Crack
 As it gets cracked you watch as one of the
teeth goes flying from the impact of your giant
elbow hammer into its jaw Using that momentum it
looks back its eyes clenched down on Fjord
now almost prostrate before it holding onto the harpoon and
goes for the face This is with disadvantage
though Thatll save you It was a  and a two
It goes to bite you and you manage to pull up
your sword in the way and block it Its jaws open
and this terrible fishing breath smell cascades
over your face
 The one on the other end is blind it hears
all this noise happening its going to make a
wide shot with its harpoon in the direction of
where its hearing all this conflict
 Disadvantage  and  that still hits
Sorry Fjord You take
 No those are the dice rolls that I was
making It was a  and a  So thats nine
points of piercing damage
 Yeah You guys have done it before
 And with that Fjord goes down and the
spell fades It closes off They now have visual
 This guys going to move
 No that was his movement Thats right so
he wouldnt move He went top of the round Thank
you for the reminder of that But he used his
action to throw that So thats all he has That
ends their go Yasha youre up
 This one here All right In the water or on
the side
 You got it
 Going the full Yasha angry
 Nott and Caleb youre up next
  hits
 So the first strike with the Divine d
plus seven
  points of damage on the first strike as
you carve across its torso it hisses back still
standing though
 Thats d plus five
 Five
  points of damage As the first blade
strike carves down its body it pulls back
hissing Fjords unconscious sinking underwater
with the harpoon still sticking out of his chest
as its leaning back at an angle as he vanishes
into the dark liquid As it pulls back it yanks
the harpoon from his body and you see his body
slightly lurch up out of the water before sinking
again It pulls it back to strike at you with it
and when you pull the blade back you thrust it
right into its chest and the light goes out of
its eyes
 Thats true you have the armor on He
starts to sink and the body buoys itself back to
the top
 Its the Mariners armor that he had the
enchantment put over
 All righty that ends Yashas turn Nott and
Caleb you guys are up
 Against which one
 It is still up As it bursts into it the
flames burn across its system but its body is
damp and slick anyway so you see the dark black
scorch marks but nothing more than that
 Ten misses unfortunately Hits the ground
behind it or hits the wall burns across and
vanishes across the rock That finishes your go
Nott youre up
 Beau is
 That hits
 All righty As you fire this one it manages
to pierce right under its throat and it turns
back towards you and it grabs the harpoon off the
ground As it pulls it back the bloods gouting
out of a major vein or artery in its throat It
tries to get the strength and as it does it
pulls back and gets woozy throws it and it lands
maybe two feet from where it grabs it and with a
horrible gurgle falls to the ground It begins to
slip and sink into the water
 Disadvantage on this one though
  hits
 Nice That ends Notts turn Are you going
to move
 All right Cali and Jester
 You are conscious  You look up and
see the faintly illusory image of Jester holding you
 Pop  Roll that attack roll
 That hits Its armor class is 
 All righty That ends Jesters go Cali
see shes like  and shoves Yasha out of
the way I want to get as close as I possibly can
Am I within  feet there
 You are
this green magic flow around Im going to cast
Dragons Breath at rdlevel on myself Then she
inhales Acid breath foot cone over the creature
 Yeah foot cone
 As the acid sprays out towards it it covers
the area
 Dex saving throw for the merrow as it tries
to avoid it That is a natural three plus zero
Thats a failure
reroll some of this but Im not now So thats
going to be  acid damage
 Nice As you finish spraying it down and all
the flesh on the outside of its body is beginning
to melt away and burn and bubble it 
Its pretty scarred from that immediate spray
across the front part of its torso
 You see the eye gleaming still with the
Light spell All right that finishes your turn
Beau top of the round you
 Okay All right As you go for the big
sweep your staff goes  
 Bits of rock and shale is being ground and
falling all around you
 Exactly a little snap at the end Roll for
the attack
 That hits Roll damage
  points of damage Thats the first
strike
 Okay As you spin it this way it wedges
itself from the floor to the ceiling and you have
to like boom
  hits
 Ten points of damage Whack You crack into
it and it hits into its torso It looks like its
bleeding out of its mouth onto its stomach It
looks really painfully hurt and its eyes are
dashing around each way It looks like its
starting to turn its head towards the area where
it emerged
 Okay using a ki point
  misses
 This time as you try to punch it manages
to dodge the first one and the second time you go
to swing one of the pieces of stone that had
dislodged slightly from when you had impacted it
falls and catches your fist in the middle of the
air It shatters and causes this cloud of dust to
cross the creature but your hand fucking hurts
 Thats it End of Beaus turn Fjord youre
up
 Back to there yeah
 Go for it
 That hits
 Yeah roll damage
 How do you want to do this Its turning
around and slithering away Its about to dive
back into the water and probably disappear into a
subterranean tunnel thats filled
 As you release your hand both bolts arc
outward and slam into it from the back From the
front perspective it would look like Guyver how
he tears the chest and the beams come out but
instead its its internal organs being shoved out
into the wall and theres two open holes
Tombstonestyle before it hits the water and
slithers and sinks down into the small tunnel
 The impact hit it and began 
 Were out of initiative at this point
dives into try and grab this thing out of the pool
 Sure Make a dexterity saving throw to see
if you can react quick enough
 Sure Its less of a skill check Its more
of a reactionary thing so you wouldnt be able to
help with it
 Five Okay youre trying to reach it but
it sunk too low
 Youre hitting stone and then nothing just
water below
and snaps at Beau  Get away from my
stuff Thats my kill  Sorry I
didnt mean to yell Sorry about that
 Do you clear the water
 You do and you see that the tunnel curves
below and evens out It sunk hit the bottom
sediment and dragged a little bit and came to
rest about maybe  feet below the surface You
take a moment to dive under grab it and whether
through a chain of hands or whatever because its
pretty heavy Its a large body probably weighs
close to  pounds So you guys have to all
together pull it up and it takes a few moments to
do so But Jesters pretty beefy
 Between the two of you you eventually get
it up back into the chamber
 At which point the Friends spell ends and
you can feel an influence that was previously
there over your personality
 Kiri comes around the corner with the
dagger sees you all standing there 
 Runs up to the body there and goes dagger
slice  I killed people
 Stabs the body a few more times
 Okay whos helming the investigation Okay
an individual has to helm it
 All right Caleb youre being aided so make it
with advantage
 That wasnt cocked technically
 Oh did it Okay Metal dice
 Okay
 As you guys are rummaging through with Caleb
helming this section youre going through a bunch
of empty crates partially destroyed crates
Pushing aside the mostly torn apart corpse of this
crocodile and ignoring that You manage to find a
number of gold and silver pieces that have been
scattered and lost and fallen into the sand
Digging through the natural gravel and sand floor
of this chamber you find that a lot of it has
just been buried They werent interested in gold
pieces They werent interested in money A lot of
that was left behind and scattered and has
been covered You take a moment to pull through
and you manage to acquire  gold  silver
pieces and  copper pieces
 Correct
 You find a bunch of jewelry necklaces and
rings that are thrown about and lost
 Okay All the jewelry together would come to
about just for purposes of resale  gold worth
of jewelry There are no diamonds in there worth
 gold sorry There are four sets of manacles
 The manacles are empty though they are
bloody
 Yes four sets of bloody manacles
 No these do not These are plain manacles
 Roughly yeah There are a number of broken
vials of some thick purple liquid but two of them
are not broken You rolled really high on your
investigation So two vials of a thick purple
liquid roughly about that big Its a thick oily
substance
 Nott you see one thing helping Caleb out
and you pull it out It looks to be a wellcrafted
marble bowl of gold inlay of a curious design The
edges of the bowl shift into five multiple dragon
heads equally separated and in each dragon the
eyes are tiny gemstones One sets rubies one
sets emeralds one sets sapphires one sets
diamond
 All righty make a sleight of hand check
Cali make a perception check
 Looking through frantically you dont see
anything there
 It gets about five or six feet deep
 Make an investigation check with
disadvantage
 Theres one of them that was a threepronged
trident and two that were just long harpoons
Theyre all hooked at the tips and they had this
thick rope cable on the edge that they were using
to pull them back in
 Just a trident
 Yeah no one noticed Nobody noticed
 Sure Usually you got to tell me before you
roll
 Thats fine
 Its brackish and thick and you dont find
much of interest
 You do find some bones
 Looking through you find a number of
discarded humanoid skeletons Four of them to be
exact
 Fjord
 As theyre having this conversation you
feel this strange crawling sensation in the back
of your head as youre looking past this pool down
into the darkness below Even though its clear
you can see the ripples and theres something
gently tugging you in that direction and a
familiar voice creeps in sourceless within your
brain that says Learn
 What the
 No short rest you can do as many times as
you want yeah
every day
 Make a perception check
 You went all the way around the other side
oblivious
 No theres no way
 The bowl is magical It is used as a
communion device When granted with enough blood
and given the proper ritual its used to acquire
auguries various bits of divination and
communication across the Divine Gate with whatever
this Scaled Tyrant may be
 It needs enough to fill the bowl
purpose is to speak with this thing on the other
side this deity
 Some sort of communion thats all you can
make out from it
 The vials are not magically enchanted
 Hold on Identify should
 Okay What are you guys doing Youre
underwater Fjord youre swimming down going
through the darkness keeping your way there It
goes under for about  feet  feet Youre
pulling your way across the ceiling as it levels
out curves a bit straightens Lungs start to
hurt a little bit but youre still holding your
breath okay pulling your way through this
darkness
 You pull under and youre uncertain as to
where itll end and that brief little peaking
fear in the back of your mind flashes and
memories of being under the ocean of the
shipwreck of looking up and not knowing which
direction was up That gives you this brief surge
of vertigo You stop for a second and a couple
bubbles escape Go ahead and make a constitution
saving throw
  You push through continue swim across
swim Learn You come up and all of a sudden
you can see now it begins to rise up once more
and you begin to swim up pull across the front
and then suddenly your fingers break water but
you do so carefully Take a breath slowly as your
head emerges from the dark water in what is a
large darkened chamber Make a perception check
with disadvantage
 You see where this  foot pool that
youve emerged from opens up into this chamber
that is filled with low water and a number of
divots and pools within The bars of land are
limited and thin You see from the peripheral of
your vision before it ends at that point roughly
five or six more of these creatures You see a
very faint glow in the distance a number of
objects that are piled and shoved into a central
place You see elements old pieces of stone
structures that have fallen in This chamber
inside here had a built or constructed purpose
long ago and since has crumbled as the earth has
shifted Thats as much as you can make out
 Okay cool Making your way through now you
know the path is there the confidence because you
know there is air eventually helps you push
through You make it halfway through
 Its about   feet
 You can see the bottom yeah
 You do manage to come out the other side
emerge and take your breath Now that youve been
through it once and managed to go through it a
little more confidently you didnt have to worry
about holding your breath
  Im so proud of you
 Mmhmm
 Go ahead Make a dexterity check opposed
 Disadvantage for you because you werent
expecting it
 The bowl leaves your hand Now Beaus
holding it
 No its faded
 Shes not being subtle
 You throw it on the ground It rolls off
untouched
 All the acid runs off of it unscathed
 Okay Youre going to strike it as youre
dispelling it Is that what youre doing
 Okay You hold your Magicians Judge up you
lift it over your head and swing it down with all
your might Go ahead and make the check for the
Dispel Magic on the sword
 Its under the description of the sword on
your app Its a d plus Not the attack roll
its under the ability
 Yeah so roll and add three
  As you strike downward theres a brief
moment where you see a flash of energy as if the
field is temporarily dissipating whatever magical
connection this object holds In that brief
eversosubtle instance of time in which this
marble bowl is left in a brief blip in history it
is exposed to the elements The blade carves
through and shatters The glow  For
that instance there is a brief burst of bright
green blue red white black energy that
emanates and this low growling rumble And with
that the bowl and whatever enchantment it held is gone
 Its interesting As it shattered and while
youre having this conversation theres this
static electricity around Yasha Occasionally as
she brings her hand closer you watch as these
little bolts of energy are arcing through here As
it slowly fades you can see theres a slight
faint glow of the symbol she holds at her belt
that eventually goes mundane as well
done I throw my arms around you draconic claw
piercing in a little bit
 Make an investigation check to search for
where the shards all landed
together to get ready to leave but Im going to
head over to Nott because Calebs walked off
 Okay Cali climbs the rope with a brief
glimmer of her feet vanishing into the tunnel
above You all settle in to rest and decide what
youre going to do with the rest of this chamber
if anything And thats where well end tonights
game
 Good drama Its fun

Good night

 Hello and welcome back
 So Where we last left off the Mighty Nein
have been making their way towards Beleben and the
Labenda Swamp to tackle the first of their two
tasks they had taken from the Gentleman in Zadash
Traveling along the way you managed to save and
make friends with a very young kenku named Kiri
who has been accompanying you through your journey
thus far You managed to find an individual who
could guide you through the swamp who was
summarily taken and probably eaten by a troll that
was stalking you through the swamp You found an
ally named Cali Calianna who was a
dragonblooded sorcerer who seemed to have aligned
interests towards the direction you were traveling
to find the safe house that belonged to the
Gentleman that had gone quiet Upon hearing that
there had been some sort of attack on it all of
you went through the swamp forded the dangers
made your way to the base of the tree where it
was discovered to be within and below the base of
this large banyan tree on the northern side of the
Labenda Swamp
 Banyan Its a bangin tree Just want you
to know of all the trees Ive seen its pretty
bangin After investigating the scene and trying
to pick up details about what had transpired you
found a number of bodies that had been put up
left to bloat and die as a warning for those who
had made their way in On the inside it looks
like the interior of the safe house had been
cleaned out and summarily dragged through a
subterranean tunnel Following this tunnel down
below you found strange twistedlooking merfolk
called merrow that seemed to have been living in
these partially submerged tunnels this system
beneath the swamp You engaged in battle killed a
number of them and upon sifting through some of
the remnants of what was dragged out of the safe
house you discovered Calis quarry which was a
bowl that could speak to the Scaled Tyrant
Tiamat You decided what to do and after a brief
confrontation the bowl was handed over to Yasha
who attempted to sunder it using her Magicians
shattered into pieces Cali with her quest
complete and not wishing to put herself into any
further danger decided to leave bidding you all
adieu and clambered back up through the strange
dug tunnel that leads to the surface You guys
were left to think about what the next course of
action was before Fjord made a brief swimming
excursion into one of the faroff tunnels that led
to a larger chamber and a base of operations where
more of these merrow live From the outskirts of
what you could see more remnants of what was
taken from the safe house existed further in
Mighty Nein youve seen Cali clamber off You
guys have taken down from the heat of the moment
What do you wish to do
 Kiri pipes up  BirdEye
Fjord
  BirdEye Fjord
  Sticking
 Okay As you guys are making your way up and
climbing using the roots and the rope and the
interior you begin to now that youre not
focused on whats below notice that a lot of the
earth in this particular tunnel that isnt too
wide necessarily its about three feet wide in
most places You can see the claw marks where
its been dug out The softer portion of the
ground where you landed upon emerging from making
your way down you can see a lot of the earth and chunks of
root that have been carved out It wasnt a natural
tunnel or something they discovered they dug up
into the safe house to retrieve whatever was
inside Nevertheless you all make your way up
into the hollow base of the safe house tree You
guys can set up camp if youd like to
  Mimicking things
  Long time
  I am Kiri
  Yes Im very sweet
  Go fuck yourself
  Go fuck yourself
 
 At this point its probably just past dusk
Theres a little bit of blue cresting into night
time Lights coming through the trees but it
looks like youre about half an hour out from a
pitch black sky
 Okay Make an arcana check
 Okay Assessing its design paying attention
to its construct and the handles and the edging
of where the different facets of it are affixed to
this cagelike exterior to it you really have no
idea what material its made from The faint
magical essence that comes off of it and with the
training you have had across the various schools
of magic this seems hard to pin down Youre not
sure the source of its magic but it does seem
very old It seems like its been shaped or its
been polished from whatever its raw form was at
one point in time
 Okay
 Yeah using it as a pillow
 All right the rest of you find yourselves
to sleep or is there anything else you wish to do
before the nights done Any order of taking
watch or are you all just resting under the
protection of Calebs silver thread
 Okay
 Well say that was for your first watch
While you guys are having that conversation one
of you roll with advantage on your perception
check or you can both roll separately your call
 Oh leave him hanging
 Thats true
 Good incharacter moment there
As you guys are finishing your conversation
your watch comes to an end without incident
 You rest so easily with the blood leaking
out You finish your watch you wake up Nott and
Jester and you guys take on your second watch Do
you want to both make a roll for perception or
 Okay Worked out great last time
 Okay
 While you guys are taking some time concentrating
on listening out for anything and feeling pretty
solid in your ability to maintain vigil across
this dark eerie night in the center of this
hollow tree you dont hear or see a goddamned
thing But a little twinkle hits your ears Caleb
 As suddenly something down below by
the pool on the opposite end of that kidneyshaped
interior cavern seems to go off
 Yes you come to consciousness
 They are awake
 Shes all curled up in the corner like
 with her feathers all poofed up
 Okay roll a stealth check for Frumpkin
 Cats can do some pretty crazy shit
 Okay Frumpkin drops down onto the soft and
makes it around Focusing on it you can see that
another merrow has emerged into that chamber and
nope
 Goes around and sees the bodies there lying
in the middle of the space He 
 He goes and drags him back a little bit
begins rifling through whatever it might have had
and looks over right at Frumpkin Grabs the
trident spear and throws it
 You werent close enough to do that I dont
think
  feet to snap him back or is it
shorter than that Doublecheck on that real fast
 As an action you can temporarily dismiss
your familiar It doesnt say range You can
cause it to reappear within  feet of you
Thats what I forgot So you can do that The last
thing you see briefly before Frumpkin vanishes
is this threepronged trident rocking through the
darkness with what faint little bit of visibility
that Frumpkin has not even being able to see much
down there in the darkness before disappearing
   Go fuck
yourself
 Holding your action if it comes back
around the spell is either fizzled or released
So you can wait for something and then cast the
spell as an action
 If you ended up holding it for a few minutes
yes because the idea is that youre casting the
spell and then holding onto that last piece of the
incantation
 No you pulled the rope up
 You guys take a moment in silence
 Two minutes pass Three minutes pass
 Then you hear this eversofaint grinding of
root on scale This merrow sentinel slides
slithering like a snake out of the curtain of
roots that currently cover that one portion of the
wall that leads further beneath the safe house
All of you guys take a surprise round As soon as
it emerges to go ahead and inspect its like
Huh
 Yeah It emerged and jackintheboxed out
towards you
 That is a four nope
 Ten radiant damage Good to know
 Oh buddy  Nothing
 For the purpose of it all happening at once
just one attack
 Two strikes Its whatever your attack
action is
 Misses
 Both miss Unfortunately because you guys
dont have any light in here when it emerges
youre all swinging in the darkness hoping to hit
it in the direction of where it is
 You would be yes
 Is this Magic Missile
 That misses
 All right
 Both hit Roll damage
 All righty
 On your first attack
 They are considered monstrosities so
consider that for any damage you deal to them with
your sword
 Youre not raging so you dont have the
plus two Nor do you have your
 Correct because youre not raging
 Thats enough Even with all of your misses
you watch as it emerges and then 
and slumps Yeah as you grab it it
starts sliding back into the tunnel You grab and
lift him hes heavy as shit and you all
together manage to slip it into and onto the floor
 Fair enough
 What little bit of light you have in the
chamber right now is a little faint radiant glow
from the sword that Molly currently has that is
like candlelight if anything
 Frumpkin emerges you send Frumpkin back
down Make a stealth check for Frumpkin
 The loudest cat youve ever heard Frumpkin
is the neighborhood cat in heat at this point He
makes his way down through the tunnel Make a
perception check with disadvantage for Frumpkin
because hes now coming around the edge
 Would it cancel out I would ask you to keep
the stats of your cat on you for future reference
 They have advantage on wisdom perception
checks that rely on smell Id say sure
 Yeah itll cancel out so a straight roll
 Okay Frumpkin heads on down keeps an eye
out on that space does a little pass No sign of
any other emerging or present merrow
 Slowly lowering the rope back down the
tunnel which one of you is taking point on
climbing down
 You make your way down the rope aiding you
in the process You get to the bottom you as
well Id like you both to roll stealth checks
please as you emerge in the lower cavern
 You two gingerly step your way around the
edge back to the site you can see of the three
corpses of the merrow there in the center of the
opposite side of the cavern
 As you make your way around to the other
pool you can see the water disturbed relatively
recently isnt perfectly still but its nearing
there Its coming to rest No sign of anything
down there
 Five minutes go by
 Yasha you begin to drag the bodies back
into the central pool They sink
 All right You complete the latter half of it
Okay You finish the spell you sense the arcane
unseen net of the alarm click in and its prepared
and set to keep watch
 You guys make your way back climb back up
the rope and make your way into the interior of
the tree seemingly without incident
 Yasha takes final watch Go ahead and roll a
perception check for me
 Both of you guys make perception checks for
me please
 As you guys complete the third watch for the
evening you sense the morning come as the
temperature which previously had gotten quite
chilled is beginning to rise a bit though now
you can still see your breath in the air A faint
bit of bluish light begins to appear at the outer
edges of the driftwood piece that is wedged in the
doorway to make it look flush with the rest of the
exterior bark You all complete a long rest You
have your abilities back your hit points full
and you are ready to continue
 Sure
 Okay In the early dawn hours of the new
day as the blue begins to slowly become brighter
in the distance
 I would like you to roll a dexterity check
please Take advantage because hes not moving
 Maybe its the tensile strength of her arm
muscles but such a large instrument seems
unexpectedly delicate across the features of your
face Its not a complete shave there are areas
that get missed because its not a very fine
implement but for the most part the stubble gets
closer to your face There are a few sections that
are unevenly smooth but its an improvement from
where it was before Its as good a shave you can
get with a greatsword Manages to avoid nicking
any major arteries and as you complete your work
youre proud of it the sweat on your brow Caleb
has no idea of how it looks other than you
reaching up and touching your chin as it finishes
The rest of you come to consciousness
 
 Pulls the knife out  Its an
amphibious assault
  Yes Im very sweet
 All right so Pass Without a Trace
 Its true
 Pass Without a Trace Whats the range on
that
 So you may want to go next
 You may want to go next then if you want
that to affect other people
 Okay
 You for the moment wade into it and
 You guys watch as Fjord once again
disappears beneath the surface of the water Now
with the confidence of knowing that there is a
breaking point and air ahead that fear doesnt
creep up into your brain and you rush for it
Making your way through make an athletics check
  okay You manage to find it through and
then come up quietly just
 Yeah Apocalypse Now andor The Descent You
slowly emerge from the water
 Yeah
 Glancing up your range of darkvision is 
feet or  feet
  feet okay
 Racial features it should say
  feet great That gives you enough
perspective for now as you come up and look You
can see this chamber and you got a brief glance
at it before Most of it is natural rock but
there are elements of it that look like it was
once an old bit of mason architecture You can see
edges where there are actual stones stacked and
placed Walls that have seemingly been partially
reclaimed through the ages You can see two large
central pillars where stalagmite and stalactite
met eventually and created a structure in the
center A large portion of the floor is submerged
in water and you see different paths and avenues
of it that curve off and vanish Probably openings
to other tunnels beneath The pool youre in right
there looking up you can see theres that weird
set of natural stairs that step up in front You
can see four of these merrow creatures two of
which are in a conversation off to the left two
that are currently rummaging through what looks to
be piles of things that have been pulled up and
placed toward the top of the stair You can hear the
clinking of metal and things falling and tumbling
down the stairs You see a fifth figure thats at
the outskirts of your visual range thats
currently faced away and looking at whatevers on
the other side of that upward pillar But nobody
else seems to have noticed you emerging at this
point You havent made any shifting or movement
 Its possible if they were looking carefully
for you You dont know how far their darkvision
extends
 Looking around you can see there are small
mounds of various minerals that have long dripped
from the ceiling from condensation and various
water flows that have come through this interior
cavern and built this hard rocky platform thats
emerging just outside of where the pool ends So
you can bring the rope around and affix it to
that Make a stealth check as you do so please
 He is yes
 Thats a natural one You lucky son of a
bitch Through whatever grace your patron has
granted upon you
 The merrow are too distracted with whatever
they are in the process of doing to notice you
slip and hit an elbow send a pebble falling You
get low and finish tying it off They dont notice
 No It seems pretty solid
 Easy enough So after a few moments Fjord
emerges back where you guys are waiting
 Your swim speed is half your movement
  feet
 Oh right with that it is yes
 From where you are to the make a survival
check
  Best you could estimate its close to
 or so feet
 Hes back
 Coming back on the rope its a lot easier
Your first dive down took a while to feel your way through
 
 Kiri leans into you This means we are
friends
 She woke up early
 Okay all right Youre casting Pass Without
a Trace first All right You finish casting the
spell The shadows already super dark in here
with almost no light source beyond what Calebs
providing they coalesce around you and the rest
of the members of the team as you all dive into
the pool of water Its black
 To Caleb Okay Blessing of the Trickster on
you thats advantage on your stealth checks
I need everybody including Fjord to roll a
stealth check please Plus ten to your stealth score
 They rolled really high
 Thats some Vax numbers right there
 You guys all quickly emerge from the water
below your eyes focusing There is no light
source in this chamber So for those of you you
have your darkvision on You guys all have
darkvision I am pretty sure except for you
Caleb So youre relying on the rest of them to
give any sort of presence
 Yeah so
 I would need you guys to place yourselves
amongst this pool
 Kiri and Nott exist on the outskirts
 As you guys glance up the first thing you
see is there is one merrow right there whos
currently talking and discussing with one right
here
 Place yourselves where you want to be
 Theres one at the base of this right
there Up at the top facing away is the one that
you had seen at the top of the stairs Fjord
 As you guys all emerge headfirst from the
water everybody gets a surprise round except for
Yasha and Molly unfortunately You two did not
roll high enough to beat the stealth
 They rolled pretty high Everyone roll
initiative but you guys will be out of this round
  to 
 I know  to 
  to ten
 Ten to five
 Okay hold on
 Nott youre not engaging Just for the sake
of it
 Wow guys
 Thats still better than Fjord
 You all emerge from it Yasha you would be
first but your stealth you did not surprise the
individuals from this round point He doesnt
notice you guys thats a seven Beau youre up first
 Now that youre getting a better view of
this you can see a low mist is pouring down the
stairs and is filling the space around them
 All of this is water yeah
  Easy enough You get right to
him
 Youll splash in the water You wont make
it all the way to the opposite side or you may
but hell get an attack of opportunity on you as
you dart out of his melee range
 Actually if you wanted to jump across I
will say because hes surprised and he isnt
aware that youre there quite yet if you want to
leap across make an acrobatics check if you
still wanted to try and do so You will land in
the water Youll be about waisthigh in the
water if not more
 Correct
  hits
 First one hits
 Nope
  hits Roll damage for that fourth
attack
 Natural  It resists the stun Im sorry
But its doing damage to it As you slam into it
again turns around It looks like its surprised
and reeling from the impact of it
 Gills flaring angrily towards your face
Some spittle flies out of its growling mouth That
finishes your turn Beau
 Jester youre up
 Right here or this side
 Floating in the air
 Oh snap all right Go make your attack
roll
 Nope swings wide However it has apparated
and is useful in future rounds
 That is a natural three
 Seven points of necrotic damage to him got
it
 Not too bad That finish your turn Jester
Youre going to stay where you are
 That finishes your go Caleb youre up
 How big is the cube
 Wait you mean from you
 Possibly
 You would
 For you Molly Thats to signify your
Haste Keep that in mind
 Youre still in the water thrashing trying
to make your way to the edge Molly youre up
but you lose this round because you were not part
of the surprise You were lagging a little behind
as Yasha best way I can do this quickly because
theyre losing their turn as well That brings us
to Nott isnt even paying attention Fjord
 On the edge there
 No you can go into the water if you want to
go further You want to get up to him
 You can get melee range Youre in the
water and youre swimming in the water but
because of your armor it doesnt reduce your
attacks so youre not taking disadvantage on your
attack rolls
 Fjord take your one attack
  hits
 It is
  points of damage on that guy
 If he moves at all on his next turn he
takes an additional d Good to know
 This guy there
 Hes been Hexed Does that finish your
turn
 As you pull back the energy sparks around
and theres this weird movement in the water like
its thrashing the booming energy keeping that
one merrow locked in place as the other one the
Hex coalesces around its chest and holds it
 Wisdom checks got it That ends top of the
round Now Yasha you can take your turn The
ambush round is over
  hits
 Nice You rush up next to Beau cleave down
with the blade It carves through part of its
torso and it retracts and tries to pull itself
lower in the water to make itself harder to hit
What are you going to do You have a second
attack right
 Go for it
 Eight misses unfortunately Next one
swings and a miss Now the merrow all go
together because you guys left a big old gap of
initiative there
 Correct First part Im going to say
Lets make it fun
 This guy here is going to take his trident
and chuck it right towards Beau
 They have the cords still attached Thats a
 to hit
 There you go With that to there first off
Beau As it strikes you in the chest you take ten
points of piercing damage and I need you to make
a strength check for me please
 A strength check
 It was a  You get pulled through right
next to it there in the middle of the water As
you fall to the ground its going to attempt to
bite at you Since youre in the water outside of
your terrain I will give it advantage on the
strike because youre now thrashing water and
swimming and its in its own terrain Thatll be
 to hit With the bite on you there you take an
additional eight points of piercing damage At
that moment this one here is going to turn around
onto Fjord and is going to shift this way and
unleash both bite and claw attack against you
Fjord  to hit
 For that claw attack its going to be d
Seven points of piercing damage against you Fjord
 Its going to pull back after it finishes
clawing into you Its going to try and bite down
with its jaws Thats a  to hit
 You take another seven points of piercing
damage The one behind there who sees its friend
digging into Fjords torso and body watches as it
finishes its round of strikes and then
underhanded throws its harpoon towards him
Thats another  to hit
 With that you take ten points of piercing
damage I need you to make a strength check As it
pierces you grab it and it manages to careen
into the side of your hip and it hits bone You
feel it grind against the inside with the pain
 You beat it Rolled a  So you do not get
pulled It does not give him his followup attack
However hes going to move forward to get his
followup attack anyway with the rest of his
movement and is going to attempt to bite you and
is going to miss Thats a nine
 He goes to bite and as you pull the harpoon
out and turn back your shield you bash the side
of its face and it manages to pull back It scrapes
across its fishlike face but no impact or
damage All right thats going to finish his go
The one that is right next to you Yasha is going
to shift around not leaving combat with you but
going behind the pillar to give itself some cover
from anybody whos out in the vicinity Its going
to attempt to make two strikes against you
 Yes you do
 Three
 Yep
 Roll higher than a ten
 Constitution saving throw
  works
 All righty thats good on your end For
you Yasha you didnt use Reckless last turn right
 Thats a natural  on that first strike
with the claws at you That is going to be 
points of piercing damage reduced to half so you
only take seven because youre raging And the
bite attack against you is a natural two plus six
No that misses you with an eight However that
finishes their round and this guy up here who now
spins around and sees the rest of you come inside
begins shouting out in a language you dont
understand  As its holding up this
staff that has this almost crystal spike of
natural crystal at the end of it it begins to
chant something under its breath And as it spins
its hand in the air you watch as the ceiling
above you in this chamber begins to grow into this
low cloud that spirals out encompassing the
entirety of the interior of the chamber
 You see little sparks of lightning arcing
through the cloud as it spools above
 Beau I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw since youre the one closest to it
 Correct
 You suffer  points of lightning damage as
you get struck by lightning in the water Which
you watch as technically now yeah if any of you
are in the water when the lightning hits you you
have disadvantage on your saving throw because you
are in the water Didnt matter this time because
you failed anyway but you watch as the bolt
strikes Beau and she starts thrashing in the water
as the muscles tense Theres a giant burn mark on
the side of your head
 Looking pretty rough on that one
 And its going to go ahead and spin itself
over to the edge this way using the one below
Getting itself between the rest of its merrow
compatriots and you guys That finishes their
turn Beau youre up
 Go for it
 If you want to move around to get onto land
otherwise youre going to be having a hard time in
the water here attacking them because youre
constantly swimming
 You still have movement yeah So you can
move five ten    there So you manage to
whip around get out up onto land and not end up
with a disadvantage on your attacks
  does hit yes
  does not hit unfortunately But the
first strike as you pull up cracks it right in
the jaw The next one it manages to bash your arm
out of the way and it deflects off the side no impact
 All righty the first strike
 Okay so as you get up on land you focus
and looking around sidetoside make sure that
youre aware of everything around you and get
ready to defend and deflect
 Okay that finishes Beaus turn Jester
youre up
 Go ahead and roll the attack for that guy
 Okay all right what was the number
  is its armor class so yeah thats
fine Well  actually so that definitely hits
 Seven points plus your wisdom modifier
 There you go  points of damage to him
All right how do you want to do this

 Yasha as youre engaged with it both
growling at each other you watch as suddenly its
body crumples into the stonework
 It slips into the water and vanishes beneath
the waves
 So thats your bonus action You still have
your movement and action
 Right there
 All righty
 Cure Wounds is touch so you have to be
right next to him
 Okay whats the range on that
 Caleb youre up next so be ready
 Right now None there is no light
  feet All right yeah so you can do it
from there if you want
 Natural 
 No thats disadvantage on wisdom checks
not wisdom saving throws Hex doesnt affect
saving throws
 Yeah but for instance if you had said
strength checks then every time it tries to pull
somebody it would have disadvantage on that
 But now you know going forward with Hex
 Going to stay where you are
 All right that finishes Jesters turn
Caleb youre up
 The one thats attacking Beau or the one at
the very top
 All right go for it Disadvantage on all
the attacks
  just barely hits
  misses
 So one of them hits The two other ones
careen off and you watch as they streak out into
the darkness past this merrow what looks to be a
priestlike entity up there thats commanding the
storm Exploding on the rocks behind it one
hitting this piece of longlingering templelike
interior And one finally strikes it in the chest
Go ahead and roll damage on that one
 It does make a concentration check Natural
 plus two It does succeed in maintaining
concentration
 Thats your turn Calebs done Molly
youre up
 The other one Or do you still have the one
activated from before
 Which one Here
 Okay that will put you right there So you
rush up to the edge there You used your bonus
action you have your two attacks and your hasted
attack
 So two attacks Go ahead and roll damage on
that
 Eight points of damage nice
 All righty Youre using the ds for
your
 Cool so as you rush up you swing the
scimitars in this blast of speed Two of them
manage to strike true to its body cutting out a
piece of it Its looking pretty hurt now
starting to bleed out where the wounds are hit
But its growling in your face as it spins around
Its fins curl up from the side and you can smell
this awful swampy almost sulfurous smell from
its breath in your face Is that your turn
 All right that brings us to Nott who is
waiting patiently with Kiri
 Is that your turn
 That brings us to Fjord
 Okay
 And Blink is not concentration correct
 Yes all right So with that Fjord vanishes
from the battlefield Well use this as a spatial
positioning device of where you were before
 That ends Fjords turn That brings it to
the top of the round Yasha youre up
 Fjord vanished You see two now turning
their eyes towards Mollymauk whos right there
Theres one across the way thats currently
barrelling on Beau and theres the one at the top
of the stairs right now that looks like its
commanding a giant storm
 Over here
 So thats five ten     Youre
in the water swimming so your attacks are at
disadvantage right now
 If you wanted to do Reckless you could
counteract that but youll be taking
 Wait so that was disadvantage
 Got you so the first attack was what
 That hits So your first attack hits Go
ahead and roll damage on that
  points of damage nice All right and
you have your second attack with disadvantage
  hits Go ahead and roll damage on that
 This is you only do five additional damage
on this one Right So 
 Damn nice roll As you in the water
cleave out once with the blade in this giant
splash arc of water from the middle of the pool in
the center it carves across the side of its back
 It turns around towards you right as
you bring the second strike up into its abdomen
It pushes off the blade and it looks pretty hurt
Its bleeding out of its wounds in the middle of
its stomach and its back That finishes your
turn
 That ends your turn Its their turn So I
will need you first off to make a dexterity
saving throw As you come up and carve into the
back of it the one on top hisses and directs its
finger down towards you as a bolt of lightning
arcs out of the
 Yeah saving throw Plus
 That does not succeed Youre in the water
so it would be disadvantage anyway
 That is  points of lightning damage which
is not halved on you because the rage doesnt
affect it It only affects slashing piercing and
bludgeoning So youre blasted in the middle of
the water You sink for a moment as your muscles give
out your sword almost falls out of your grasp
and you manage to right yourself as youre
treading water here Your feet cant touch the
bottom of this pool and your eyes go flashing
white for a second and for an instant you see
the face of Kord the Stormlord there from the
vision your recently had Then clarify and shake
it out of your head and carry yourself back into
place Thats going to finish this guy whos going
to move around He can only move ten feet so he
goes five ten Hes going to stop right there
 This guy right here is going to go ahead
towards you Beau as youre right there He has
disadvantage on the attacks against you though
Hes going to go ahead and make its claw attack
against you with disadvantage Thats cocked You
saved yourself from a natural  with that one
Its a  which I believe misses right
 So as it claws toward you you being
prepared for it dart off to the side Its going
to go ahead and take a bite at you
 With disadvantage another natural 
averted However that does come to a  so I
believe that does hit you
 That is  points of piercing damage as it
bites down onto the front of your clavicle and face
 Beau falls to the ground As she sinks from
its jaw under the rock there it spins around
towards you right in your face its gills flaring
up Thats going to end its turn The two over
here this ones going to move there and theyre
both going to flank Molly They are both going to
harpoon you jam melee at the one on this side
First attack is going to be an  to hit
 Whats your armor class
 Plus two because of the Haste
 Oh buddy That does hit you So the first
harpoon strike against you thats eight plus
four  points of piercing damage It jams you
into the abdomen from that side The other strike
 This guys finishing his round Hes
attempting to bite you thats going to be a 
 As he bites down towards you this time as
you pull the trident out you jam it up and it
throws him off and clips him in the side of the
chin breaking off one of his teeth At that
moment the guy behind you is going to swing in
with his harpoon as well
 Okay reaction to that
 Thats cocked So he has a regular strike on
this one so the attack with the harpoon is going
to be a  to hit unfortunately
 Well he had advantage because he had you
flanked so it just made it a general roll
 So that is going to be ten points of
piercing damage as the other harpoon jams you in
the back As youre arcing upward its going to
attempt to bite down at you but its eyes have
gone dark and its just biting wild in front
using the thrashing of your body to guide itself
That is going to be a natural seven plus six 
Misses So it bites down you manage to duck out
of the way and slam the hilt of your scimitar up
into its face and knock it off to the side Thats
going to end their go That brings us to Beau I
need you to make a death saving throw please
 Thats one success Mark it on your tattoo
Jester youre up
 Its a foot range right So itd be
right there
 Shes gliding on the water tiptoe
  points to Beau You come back to
consciousness on the ground your body was just
starting to roll and slip into the water You
catch one of the rocks and keep yourself from
going back into the drink
 Well your action was to
 Right thats correct That finishes your go
there Caleb youre up
 Over here You can get partway into the
water
 Possibly
 Hes here Thats   so most
likely
  Just outside of  for the
range
 Looking at that I believe the level is
level three or lower Its a rdlevel spell The
storm immediately with one final crackle fades
and dissipates above The cavern above now just
the empty dark roof it was before the storm no
longer present
 That ends Calebs turn Molly youre up
  does not hit You have three more attacks
with your bonus action if you want to
  hits Roll damage on that
 Nine points of damage all righty
 Barely
  hits
 Thatll do it how do you want to do this
 A whirling dervish of blades as you carve
through You start biting through with the blades
carves one part of its chest part of its arm
down on its chest looks up and right
through its face
 Go for it
 That finishes Mollys turn Nott
  Wrapped around his weenie
 Okay You cannot see Kiri just vanishes
amongst the visuals of the illusion
 All right finishing Notts turn Fjord
Where do you want to emerge
 Well technically that was the other guy
 Yeah They shifted around
 They did
 If youd like to fucking stay If you want
to you can appear up top there and get
a flanking bonus
 You can use it against them they can use it
against you as long as you are directly across
from an enemy with an ally you can give yourself
flanking benefit
 On this one Okay There you go
 Go for it
 Flanking Its advantage on your attacks
  does hit
 That hits roll damage for each
 How do you want to do this You fucked that
guy up
 Molly its pulling back ready to leap at
you and as it lurches towards you it stops you
watch as the upper half of its shoulders and head
slip and slough off into the water
 You vanish out of the space Thats a hell
of a round Yasha youre up
 Right now No
 Beau is not threatening You have to be on
the opposite sides
 Yep because youre in the water
  just hits
 Nice
 Its hanging on by a thread
 Yeah thatll do it How do you want to do
this
 So onehanded wide swing with the same
motion you reach up right into the wound tear it
through and maintain eye contact as it tumbles
over into the water and disappears beneath the
surface
 That ends your turn You still have your
movement
 Youre right next to Beau on the ground You
got out of the water All right ends your turn
 Theres a sound in the nearby water as
emerging from one of the other caverns on the
side another merrow emerges from that side and
another emerges from this side The one up top
here that sees everyone closing in is going to
back up into the water and is going to cast Call
Lightning again It wants to bring it about Use
the other level three spell slot With that as
the cloud forms up in the sky again seeing you
step out of the water you do not have
disadvantage on the saving throw but I need you
to make another dexterity saving throw
 It is a  DC so you only take half damage
Which is good because that would be  damage so
you take  points of lightning damage
 Yes  points of lightning damage
 Hes going to dive into the water You know
where he disappeared beneath the surface as you
see the water rippling out but youre not sure
where he is or how deep he is These two have
emerged This ones going to move through the
water to there and is going to make a harpoon
Lets move over a bit further because it can to
about there Its going to make a harpoon strike
towards you Yasha throwing it in your direction
Thats a  to hit
 All right you take thats a bad roll
eight points of piercing damage reduced to half
so you take four points of piercing damage I need
you to make a strength check so roll a d and
add your strength modifier as its attempting to
yank and pull you towards him
 You have advantage on your strength checks
because youre raging
 He pulled a  natural nine plus four You
get yanked Beau you watch as Yasha gets yanked
over you as youre lying on the ground and its
going to attempt to bite you as youre down in the
water once more Natural  Thats  to hit So
with that the bite attack lets roll damage on
that That is going to be ten points of piercing
damage reduced to five cause youre raging
 This guy here is going to go ahead and move
up right next to Caleb rushing out of the water
from underneath with the harpoon in its arms and
jam it towards your torso Thats going to be a 
to hit
 All right You watch as it deflects off of
your body Its going to angrily attempt to bite
down on you Thats a natural  plus six
 As it attempts to bite down towards you
theres a brief moment where the bite sinks into
your shoulder and theres a brief burst where
time seems to dart back and you step out of the
way as its bite hits air with no effect
 All right That ends their turn Now it is
Beau
 Its half your movement to get up so you
have  movement
 Wouldnt she though
 You can certainly try
 You should Do you want to try All right
So five ten  and then go ahead and make an
athletics check to make the leap Im letting you
see if you can make it across the water without
losing your movement
  Yeah  Youre just outside of
it to be within melee
  Actually   you can do it
with just one if youre there So you manage to
spin around using your bonus action for Step of
the Wind so you still have your action
  points of damage on that one Damn
Nice
 Ten misses however the critical did as
you run up from the side you parkour off the
wall the side of the pillar there leap whack
Slam it with the staff You see its head get
pushed underwater again It turns around its eyes
are adjusting like yours were a moment ago and as
you go to swing a second time it does manage to
deflect it with the side of its trident No impact
 All right that finishes Beaus turn Jester
youre up Caleb youre on deck
 At the moment This ones been hurt this
one has not been and this one is not visible It
is beneath the surface of the water
 Okay So go ahead and roll a melee spell
attack on it If you want to move here you can
flank it All righty So youre opposite of Beau
using that flank maneuver So dont forget you
guys can flank on direct opposites They can also
flank against you
 Oh natural one and a natural four
 So as you swing out with your hand your
foot catches the edge of one of the pebbles and
you stumble for a second and your hand goes wide
off to the side hits some of the stone on the
wall behind you and releases the spells impact
against lifeless wall unfortunately
 No thats Pathfinder rules
 That it can do
 No not technically a creature
 All right so d plus four
  points of damage Crack The giant
lollipop swings and hits the side of the jaw It
dislodges for a second then for a moment its
trying to hold the trident with one hand and the
others trying to push it back into place
  Awesome That finishes your go
Caleb youre up
 All righty
 Nope Nope You get scared in the moment
because youre still thrashing in the water and
you put the hand up and go 
You were aiming six feet from it It goes up like
a firework and hits the roof
 That ends Calebs go Molly youre up
 You have  feet of movement
 Are you running through the water or going
to make a leap across
  If you want to flank youll be
in the water which is disadvantage on your attacks
 Its a straight roll if you stay there or a
straight roll if you end up flanking it Yes
 So make your four attacks on it if you
want
 Okay yeah thatll do
 Yep just roll the dice
  points of damage And then your third
strike with your Haste
 All right so that hits on the third strike
there
 Ooh  points of damage in one round As
youre carving through it rapidly it is looking
pretty hurt Its not on deaths door but you
singlehandedly carved it pretty hard in one round
 You already used your bonus action
 All right that ends Mollys go Nott
 Thats amazing Okay Fjord youre up As
you reapparate within ten feet of where you were
 Just remembering why did you drop Hex
again It was because you cast
 All righty So first strike was  that
hits
  points of damage nice
 That works
 Seven points of damage thatll do it How
do you want to do this

 Both  on its side You watch as one
of its arms gets blown off and flings landing on
the top of the stairs before rolling down a few
steps and coming to rest
 It slips down into the water Yasha you
take one swipe at it for good measure as it sinks
below All right and roll your d to see whether
you stay or go
 Yasha youre up
 Right now youre in the water so with full
speed youre probably not going to get to it
unless you take an action to dash
 You have  feet of movement Theres the
guy whos underwater over here somewhere and
theres the guy thats currently assaulted by most
of your team on the other side
  There
 Okay so you reach down and touch the
front of your chest
 Oh shit
 So that ends your turn
 Emerging from the water the water splashes
up as it glances up On the other side that one
merrows right there have him surrounded is
going to make one strike again towards Caleb That
is a  to hit
 Okay That comes to  points of piercing
damage I need you to make a constitution saving throw
 You can because its attacking someone
thats not you
 
 I believe your constitution is  if I
recall Which brings a  to what you rolled
 Yeah  Failure Haste wears off because
you lose concentration
 When the spell ends the target cant move
or take actions
 And to follow that up its going to bite
down towards Caleb seeing that youre probably
the easiest meat around here unarmored Thats a
natural  Im having really good luck
 All right so with a bite attack against
you that is  points of piercing damage to you Caleb
 Oh my god Okay Ending that turn the other
one standing there emerges the storm in the sky
It sees you standing up again and goes 
Sounds like some horrible curse I need you to
make a dexterity saving throw
 Thank you Taliesin A great gift Im glad
Ive been able to use finally
  okay so half damage Well see what it
rolls
 That is a nine a one and a three 
points of damage Lightning damage Halved to six
Not even joking You can look at the dice
 I cant fucking believe that
 You are a fucking warlock is what that is
You know that but
 God damn it
 And is going to vanish once more beneath the
surface of the water You dont know quite where
it is thats where you last saw it disappear
That brings us to Beau
 You have advantage on these because youre
flanked currently with Jester
  hits him Armor class of 
  hits roll damage for the second strike
 Whack whack You hit both sides with the
staff Its being knocked around spitting blood
out of its mouth Its hurt
 Its hurt pretty bad
 Make two more strikes against it
  does not hit but one of them does
 Seven points of damage how do you want to
do this

 Whack Right across his face The impact
throws its head with such a speed down onto the
rocks right at the bottom of Jesters feet
Crack It slowly slides gurgling into the water
sinking below
 Jester youre up
 Right there
 Good to know Finishing your turn Jester
Caleb youre up
 You can just barely get onto land if you
want
 Okay
 Okay you step back That ends your turn
Caleb as youre holding your action Molly
 Nott
 With your movement you get most of the way
across on the rope but you can bonus action to dash
 With that Nott just barely emerges from the
distant pool of water
 You dont see any monsters
 Notts splashing behind you
 Perfect Fjord
 Whereabouts
 Good to know Roll your dice
 Held actions and Blink can be a really
tricky thing
 Its like an ethereal like Frodo with the
ring on
 This is what Ripley used on you guys last
campaign
 That finishes Fjords turn Yasha youre
up
 Hold your action in case something shows
up
 That ends your turn That brings us the
merrow shallow priests turn As youre all
focusing on this element a small ripple of water
emerges over here as it has swum down below the
water
 Cats Paw What does it have to roll for it
  strength
 Does it get a saving throw you mean A
strength saving throw
 That is an eight No
 It is currently restrained right
 Go for it
 Yeah its gargantuan All right how much
damage was that
 Six total damage
 At which point its holding its staff still
and  spins its arm around A level two
Thunderwave bursts out in front of it in a foot
cube hitting both Beau and Caleb I need you both
to make a constitution saving throw please
 No
 A constitution saving throw
 That is a success so you take half damage
 Nope That is  points of thunder damage
You take half of that so you take eight
 Youre still up
 Cats Paws gone Calebs unconscious Easy
come easy go Beau you are thrown ten feet back
into the wall there as the smoke dissipates from
the Thunderwave Wham Into the wall and fall to
one knee Lets see No thats all of its
movement It took all of its movement to get
there so thats where it stands Thats going to
end its turn Beau
 Oh it has to make a constitution saving
throw to see if it maintains the thunderstorm
above Which it succeeds
 Go for it
 Youre technically in the water so the
attacks are at disadvantage
  still hits
 Ten damage Got it
 All right that hits again Second attack
  damage Two constitution saving throws
Thats a success and a success so its still
maintaining concentration on the lightning storm
 It swings wide Its laughing under its
hissing breath as youre punching and its
starting to try and slowly submerge into the
water
 That brings us to Jester
 Right here
 Over here you mean
  Thats where you are but youre
in the water right now Youre 
 Yes you would
 Go for it You have disadvantage
 Youre flanking it so its a straight
attack yes You pull back 
  You reach up and right as you
The dice are not with you Im so sorry Laura
Im so sorry
 As you reach out with this crackling bolt of
looming necrotic energy it manages to spin around
and a burst of wind immediately pushes your arm
just off course and it releases harmlessly in the
air Im sorry
 All right roll for the attack on it
 You cast it at level two earlier though Im
so sorry
 No it was level two at the beginning
 I trust you guys
 Sorry Jester That finishes your turn
Caleb I need you to make a death saving throw please
 Thats a failure First failed save on
Caleb
 All right Molly you have a turn now
 Make an athletics check
 No You go   
   You get up there
 Combat range yes
 You can only use your bonus action to attack
if youve used your action to attack
 Thats what Im thinking but Ill double
check what the rules are there
 Every now and then you need a reminder
folks
 When you take the Attack action and attack
with a light melee weapon that youre holding in
one hand you can use a bonus action If you
dont attack you cannot bonus action attack
 Is it an action or a bonus action to use
Because youve used your action this turn
 I believe Enthrall as a spell is an action
 Vicious Mockery I believe is also an
action
 But youre in melee
 That ends your turn Molly Nott
  Its within  feet As youre
running out of the water 

 That hits Roll damage with the additional
Burning Bolt
  points of damage
 It has to make a constitution saving throw
to see if it maintains No it does not It drops
the lightning
 Yeah Next attack
 That hits Roll damage
 The shallow priest is looking hurt
 Its a merrow shallow priest
 Does that finish your turn Nott
 Fjord
 Ten feet right there
 Goes wide strikes a nearby rock
  misses
 This one has higher armor than the rest As
you release both bolts its flailing around hurt
after taking the impact from the bolts You can see
the burst of flame on its back from the shot it
took from Nott and as it lurches forward it
manages to arc out of the way of your bolt No
impact
 Roll to see if you stick around
 Lag spikes are rough when youre on a
raid guys
 Top of the round Yasha youre up
 Right now No the space right there where
technically it is Ill say you can get up on
there sure Using all your movement you can get
on there Its a little wobbly
 No Hold on Beau was in the water This
technically is not a space you can get on You
would not be able to flank with it You can get
there if you want to Because this is in the space
 No because you have to be on the exact
opposite That space is currently occupied by the
stalagmite
 Youre in the water so disadvantage on your
attacks
  hits
 Nice
  hits Roll damage for your second
strike
  points of damage It is so close It is
hurt so bad As you slash twice in the water you
see these large arcs of stale stagnant cave water
splashing in the air with this gleaming blade as
Yashas tearing into it The pool around it is
turning dark purple as its blood is seeping in and
its looking desperately around for some means of
escape That end your turn Yasha
 Its now the shallow priests turn
 Yeah Thats what its going to do Level
two Thunderwave
 Hmm
 It would have thrown you back into the wall
Theres nowhere more for you to push this way
 The placement here makes it a little hairy
Its going to go ahead and
 Its a fifteenfoot cube In front of you
And its trying to Yeah you guys are positioned
in such a way where it
 Well yeah but you cant be part of a cube
and Im trying to figure out what would be the
most optimal way for it to use it Im going to
say
 No the ones who are hurt the most are Beau
and Yasha and theyve been the biggest problem for
these guys Its not too worried about the other
two foot cube Okay All right you know what
Its going to go ahead and attempt to shift this
way one square into the space with the Spiritual
Weapon
 From Yasha
 And from Jester Both of you guys make an
attack With disadvantage for you Yasha Its
risky on its endeavor but its whats going to
give it an opportunity to try and get out of this
lockdown
 Whatd you roll
 Okay  hits
 Yeah regular attack
  just hits
 Yep It cant move So with Sentinel it
does not get a chance to move as you arc towards
it How much damage did you do
 Nine
 Five How do you two want to do this

 Okay So as you swing with the handaxe and
you swing with the sword as it backs away
charging the energy of the Thunderwave in its
hands it tries to slink through the water the
blade of your handaxe carves into its throat from
this side  At which point the
blade hits from this side  And like a
terrible scene out of RikiOh because I have not
used that reference in this campaign the body
gets split in two sides and you watch as it falls
to the ground in three separate pieces 
all sinking beneath the water below
 Yes you do Caleb Thats cocked
 Okay
 Right now at this point there is no
threat
 Yes You drop the spell
 Okay Go ahead and heal up for that
 The last slab of its flesh that you had
carved from its head and shoulder area you push
into the water kicking it forward
 So Caleb you heal  hit points
 Well say as you guys gather to go ahead and
deal with the aftermath of this battle were
going to take a break

 Because there is time to take a break Well
be back here in just a little bit guys
 Apologies for the humming of the motor from
earlier This is the first time trying it out
Didnt really need it It was fine But yes so
Well be back here in a few minutes guys Well
see you in a little bit

 Welcome back everybody Carefully clapping
so not to clap too much
 Hi everyone Welcome back Before we jump
into the story real fast we wanted to say a quick
hello from a friend of ours who stopped by the
office and tonights studio to say hello Babs
Tarr the very extremely talented comic book
artist for many different comic series Incredibly
talented and is very much a Critter along with us
and stopped in to say hi
 Of course thanks for coming by Where can
they find you
Instagram and Twitter Check it out guys
 Thank you Babs
 Picking up where we left off You guys rush
to pull Caleb off the ground Youre all beaten
battered
 Laura
 Eight points of healing
 No we need her for as long as we can keep
her
 Anyway Your wounds close up a bit through
the incantation
 You see remnants of crates and broken goods
littered across the rough staircase now that you
take a moment to inspect it Make an investigation
check if you want to glance about the space
 Yes because you are drunk
 You find some broken pieces of pottery it
seems like Nice polished on one side with a
nice glaze
 You can write down in your inventory broken
pieces of shiny pottery Fjord
 If you look at the trident it looks like
its a very tightly woven rope but the individual
threads of rope are treated like a leathertype
stat so its a really tight leather cord
 From what you can see where it was dangling
from there theyre wrapped in a loose loop around
the side of their armor and when they throw it
they catch the end of it and pull it back
 Okay Its about  feet of leather cord if
you want to call it that Sturdy leather cord
Its heavy so its about twice the weight of hemp
rope Its stronger but its heavier
 Yeah theyre pretty strong
 If you guys want to take a short rest if
you guys are inspecting the rest of the area
 Jester as you come back into the next
chamber youre looking around and theres no sign
of Kiri You see natural stone the pool a piece
of wall to the side and theres no sign
  Im Kiri You look around
and you dont see anything
  Yes Im very sweet
  Warmer You slowly start
making your way towards this weird cylindrical
stone wall that you now realize wasnt there
before
 You reach through and your hand goes right
into a tuft of feathers 
 Kiri reaches up and grabs your hand and you
pull her through the illusion She steps out and
goes  I killed people
 Kiri points to one of the bodies of the
merrow that you had killed the night before thats
barely visible out of the water there It looks
like it has a couple stab wounds to it and Kiris like
 
  Okay okay okay
  Okay okay okay
 Make an investigation check Jester
 As you spend a moment searching around in
the middle of the dirt with no luck theres a
little knock on your shoulder with a pointed
finger You glance over and Kiri has the book
bundle the leather strap
  Points to the side corner
 If you want to start inspecting the area
 up
the stairs theres a platform above where theres
more of the boxes and crates and theres piles of
things gathered around some sort of rock
formation where that mist seems to be emanating
from which is still loosely drifting off of the
surface of the water
 Okay Make an investigation check
  okay You can see scattered bits of gold
and silver and copper that have been lost amongst
the steps here some of them covered in dirt or
mud and can be cleaned and pulled out of there As
you ascend the steps if anybody wants to join
Fjord as well You go with him as well You also
see theres a bunch of silverware thrown around
Very nice fine silverware that is in many cases
partially packed with more mud sand and whatever
grime is here It looks like everything was
brought here and largely a number of it has been
discarded or left with no particular purpose As
you begin to pore through some of it you see
theres a crate thats partially open Theres a
cache of weapons in there that are bound in
clusters with leather straps around them Looking
there there are four wellmade longswords four
wellmade shortswords two battleaxes and two
halberds that are part of this cache Theyre
resting open on the inside of this open crate
Theres a locked dark wood case about four feet
across and a foot wide that is currently closed
and latched Theres also a locked iron box thats
flat a foot and a half by a foot and a half Its
simple steel iron look to it Then theres the
stone formation thats about six to ten foot at
different places Its a bit oblong and strange
Its not a perfect oval but its made to be this
pool of water where the mist is rising and
sifting out of it Around the edges of it there
are dozens and dozens of metallic objects of
different shapes and configurations and designs
Make a religion check
 You recognize a majority of the iconography
here It looks like one of these bundles one of
these boxes that was gathered here was filled
with holy symbols and religious iconography most
of which appear to be deities that are outlawed by
the Empire You see symbols and worship idols for
the Archeart You see some for Avandra the
Changebringer You see a number of Moonweaver holy
symbols with the two crescent moons across the
silver cross You see the hook and the wreath of
the Wildmother Melora a number of those
scattered about some in disrepair with actual
pieces of dried barley and other grains around it
You see a number of symbols of Kord the
Stormlord You see a handful for the Everlight
There are a few more dubious symbols as well
Theres one that looks like a dark horned crown
that you recognize that is used to invoke
Asmodeus the Lord of the Hells You see one that
looks like you only see a few of these but it
looks like a series of chains and shackles that
are across a coffinlike box and you know that
because you rolled super high to represent Bane
the Strife Emperor who is a deity of conquest
 There it is
 As well as the clawed hand on a number of
items that resemble Tiamat the Scaled Tyrant
 Jester you return Did you take Kiri with
you
 At this point you hear a distant sound that
echoes through the wall  You spin and
look over and you can see Jester emerging from the
water and a little black bird that is currently
fluttering to try to get the water off the
feathers
 Theyre dry
 Nott what were you looking at
 Yeah theres two boxes
 Okay As you focus there is a as you look
over there is a faint magical aura from inside
the pool where the mist is emanating and the long
wooden box emanates a magical source from the
inside
 Youd have to try and retrieve the body It
sunk into the water
 The staffed one Okay As you pull the staff
over the staff does not have any magical
properties It looked like it was just a focus for
whatever spellcasting it was doing Make an
investigation check as you were going back to the
body
 If you want
 You feel a magical presence within the pool
Not the pool itself but within And the mist is
still pouring over the edges of it
 Yeah the upper platform
 Yes
 Enchantment
  Enchantment
Hi Yuri
 Make an investigation check as you pore
through and find as many as you want to
 Are you glancing through as well
 Okay Make an investigation check
 This is the pile of religious iconography
  Okay Because
 All right You find and theres a number
of these You see probably in total well over
 to  various holy symbols idols small
representations pressed into metal or clay These
are all means of worship from a grand scale to a
pauper scale that seem to have been part of what
was moving through this smuggling path
 Which you find two

 You who have never met anybody else who has
ever met the Traveler you look down and find
amongst this pile two holy symbols of different
make One appears to be almost pure silver One
looks like its a little more of a burnished
bronze or a dull iron thats very very heavily
tarnished But they both have the same door arch
with the road expanding from the center
 No response
 Make an investigation check
 Yep
 You give a solid glance through and it looks
like no Ioun the Knowing Mistress is one of
the approved religions and you get the sense that
all the symbols that are here are religions that
are unapproved by the Empire or considered
betrayer gods and are not approved anywhere
 Oh plenty of Moonweaver symbols Theres
probably a good  or 
 Asmodeus
 Go ahead and make your with disadvantage
 Oh look at that Even while drunk little
Notts able to
 The latch spins off and a blade fires out
from where the lock was shoots across the room
and vanishes into the darkness before it scrapes
off some stone in the distance
 It appears to be open Theres a slight gap
now where the lid is now open You lift it up
Looking inside you see this beautiful
jewelinlaid curved golden blade of some kind
With what little bit of light that you guys have at
your disposal now you can see it shining and its
this pure gold color As you swing it for a
moment it seems to bend with the movement before
flicking back into place
 It would constitute in the vein of a
scimitar
 Its pretty wellbalanced Lighter than youd
expect And gold is not a good metal for any sort
of combat Its a soft metal and you see the
flexibility seems such but yet itd probably hit
pretty hard but youre a little worried about
using gold for any sort of combat scenario
 Swings pretty solid
 Yes and you managed to find it You find
probably about  or  different variations to the
Archearts iconography
 You find one thats pretty similar to the
one that you saw
 You pocket it
 A  to
 You find about four of them Two of them are
medallions and one of them looks like a ceramic
marker that would be hung on a wall One of them
looks like it was part of a latch on a small chest
and was torn from it You see bits of rotted wood
on the back of it where it may have been
previously pressed in and bolted against the outside
of a chest
 Sure Make an investigation check
 Okay While you guys are having this
conversation Beau is casing the joint here There
are no hidden exits In fact you get the sense
that all the entrances and exits here are through
the various pools of water You begin to think
based on placement that theres probably a
network of caverns here and possibly more merrow
that exist in the vicinity of the lake of the
Ounterloch beyond here
 Yes actually I can show you an image of
it
 That is what you see Its like an
upsidedown coffinlike design with these chains
that cross over
 Yes Its roughly a little larger than your
palm
 Sure It sinks down and for a moment it
obscures but you see this very faint yellowish
color on the bottom It disappears into the pool
 Sure You reach in and you scour around and
your hand touches and finds the symbol Next to
it theres a polished stone about that big thats
resting in the silt at the bottom
 Okay You pull out the stone and as soon as
the water emerges from it its smooth It looks
like a cats eye It has a yellowish color to it
and there are striations that refract light around
it At one end it looks like there was an impact
carved a line about three inches across on one side
 It has a very faint yellowish glow
 Its not a school of arcane magic
 Okay symbol there
 She sets it down and rests it there next to
the other symbol at an angle It doesnt look
like it matches the sword The groove thats hewn
into it what at first looked like it was impacted or
wounded by some sort of damage upon closer look
it looks intentionally placed or carved in So you
have this cats eye yellowish sphere with this
three inchwide pointed oval line in the front
 Theyre just wellmade like freshly made
and were being sent somewhere
 You cannot
 Thats where you guys are standing right
now
 Thats where youve removed from the pool
 Yes
 Fjord Something about that orb is very familiar
 Okay So while youre doing that
 There is one more metal box thats not been
opened
 Make an investigation check
 With disadvantage because you are drunk
 Okay Seems fine
 All right Disadvantage to try and open the
lock
 Thieves tools So its dexterity plus your
proficiency bonus
  Thatll do it You needed a  The iron
box opens Nothing goes off no blades no traps
On the inside you see a beautifully smithed sword
handle and hilt made from silver with an
acornsized emerald set on each side of the hilt
right in the center
 The blade extends for an inch before its
broken off at a jagged angle
 Theres an inch of the blade It seems to
have broken off at some point
 Right You did not sense any magic from
this
 You attempt to cast Mending on this
 Strangely it resists it
 Theres something about it Even though it
didnt emanate a magical essence from what he was
requesting the Mending spell for some reason is
unable to grasp the nature of this object to
complete it
 No magical essence from it but as youre
looking over it beyond just the beautiful make of
it you do see runes carved across the hilt and at
the pommel It looks like at one point it was an
enchanted blade but was sundered and is missing
the rest
 Im sorry What was that
 What was your question
 Oh fits the
 No The carve in the sphere is about three
inches long The blade looks like it wouldve been
about two inches wide and its broken off at a
jagged side angle
 Okay Investigation check Either both of
you roll or one of you roll with advantage Up to you
  Looking around you see no sign of any
other half of the blade broken or not
 Okay Anybody else Okay
 So you finish casting Identify on
 All right The sword is not magical and so
it does not give you any essence as to what
enchantment it is Looking at the runes you could
see that there was once held magic
 Oh the finished one Sorry I
misunderstood That yes
 Im sorry
 That you do have immediate grasp of what it
is capable of
 Okay so you begin concentrating another ten
minutes on the cats eye
 You choose one object to cast on
 So wait another ten minutes
 Sure
 As Calebs concentrating on it you reach
out and touch the stone Your body immediately
goes cold
 Your vision vanishes from your eyes as
darkness fills your world Your lids itch like
some sand or dirt now scrapes the inside of the
skin and you rub them with your wrist Your eyes
open to find yourself somewhere else The sky is
moonlit and cloudless the starry night looking
down at you Your clothes are not your own nor is
your body A thick brown leather overcoat lined
in buckles wraps around your torso while
sunweathered human skin marks your flesh You
notice your hands are dirty and thick with
calluses as you clutch the very same yellow
polished stone in your left hand Looking down
you see the body of the individual who was its
previous owner now still in a pool of crimson
dark You glance around the place some
junglegrown natural landmass by a pond The smell
of seawater is strong on the wind in the middle of
the night Flash in your right hand grasps the
familiar falchion water dripping from the blade
sudden uncontrollable hunger overcomes you as you
instinctually jam the stone into your gut It
slowly sinks into your human flesh painlessly As
it quickly vanishes within your belly the hunger
subsides as exhaustion takes over You fall to
your knees and look within the water your
Reward Just as quickly as the vision came in
the blink of an eye its gone your reflection
now that of the familiar halforc looking into
the pool where the stone was found but the stone
is gone The rest of you guys watched in the
middle of this concentration while Fjord touched
the stone grabbed it and jammed it into his
chest Before all of you could even react and push
forward it had already been thrust through his
armor and into his body You reach over and try
and grab him and with a strength youve never
felt in his body he lurches towards the pond and
thrusts it fully in seemingly under some sort of
uncontrolled force his eyes glazed over and
staring forward Suddenly he comes back and as
you glance around you feel tension on your body
as all your friends are grabbing onto your body
and pull you away from the pool
 Its gone
 Exhausted
 You actually take a point of exhaustion
 Theres no damage to the armor and as you
pull back some of the leather plates theres no
sign of a wound
 You dont feel any strange spheres in the
inside of your abdomen
 Dont spoil the surprise Travis
 No Nobody youd seen before All you recall
is seeing the orb and the same sword that you have
in his hand
 No weirdly
 Theres a strange aspect as you focus really
hard to remember but the face that you saw in the
water was definitely Vandrin Maybe a little
to his hair and facial hair
 The water is salt water
 The pool water is salt water All the rest
of the water in this cavern is fresh
 Yes
 Yeah and you get make an intelligence
check for me
 Looking at this and looking at the way
things are spread about you get the sense that
something drew the merrow to the safe house They
took whatever they found in the safe house below
tore through it and placed whatever was important
to them in this area
 Make an investigation check
 Its roughly five to eight feet in
diameter
 Okay You look in the well the water is
moving in there Its you
  Salt water
you start coughing for a minute and come up
 You are drowning
 You pull him out of the pool He starts
coughing up the water
 As youre doing that you do get the sense
that the longer youre here in a nexus between
these numerous merrow tunnels the higher your
chance gets of having more arriving
 You guys gather up as much as you can take
your way via the rope through the water Kiri in
tow You make your way back up handing things off
up into the tunnel Eventually over the next hour
or so get most of what was down there that you
could back up into the safe house
 I mean theyre all what they are
 No quarterstaffs They all appear to be
steel weapons that are part of this cache There
is a long polearm a halberd theres two of
them that does have a shaft of wood but its
designed for the weight of the bladed edge You
could break it off and make it a quarterstaff if
you really wanted to but it would be comparable
to what you already have
 Theyre wellmade and fresh
 Theyre less worn but theyre not deadlier
per se
 Yeah make a history check
 Sure
 Doesnt jog your memory It looks old Looks
like its been around a while
 Unfortunately you already aided somebody
with it
 You guys are back in the safe house now
yes
 Amongst you you have two of those Whoever
has them youre fine
 What are you guys doing
 You guys get up you all get ready to go
You gather your things  Watch
it sparking It disappears you begin to leave As
you guys are all walking out of the storehouse
from behind you off to the left theres a dull
sound and some dirt and water from the left side
of the tree in the middle of the hot afternoon
 The still water that currently
exists around begins to slowly drain as a part of
the swamp off to the side sinks down about ten
feet or so The water level drops a solid foot
but it comes to rest Youre sure that whatever
structure that remained down there before is now
filled with dirt sludge swamp water and rock
 Kiri is with you
 Okay Is anybody helping you with that
 Jester and Yasha start taking down the
bloated bodies
 What are you doing with the bodies Are you
leaving them in the swamp to fester
  Circle of You take them and pull
them offsite and leave them in a pile to become
one with the swamp over time Its pretty gross
work
  Welcome to the Mighty Nein

 That is now my new favorite
 I think Salt Bae cleric is my new favorite
idea for a character
 As you guys gather your things and begin to
trudge southward back into the Labenda Swamp to
make your way back to the city of Barleben a bit
wounded but youve succeeded in your first task
for the Gentleman you begin to make your way
through the reverse guidance of Caleb in the
direction you were traveling Backward guidance
well put it that way
 As youre all taking a moment to look
through keeping your eyes peeled weapons drawn
Fjord your eyes catch the summoned falchion in
your hand and there glittering in the center of
the hilt where there was none previously is a
single yellow eye
And thats where were going to
end tonights episode

 On the hilt of the blade
 Thats Materia slot
 Its like its the basis of his class
 All right Were going to pick up on that
next Thursday as you guys return Oh man shits
getting interesting and weird Thank you for
hanging with us Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as
we did Thank you Babs for being awesome and
hanging out with us tonight That was awesome
Have a wonderful week well see you guys next
Thursday we love you and is it Thursday yet

 Welcome back everyone Last we left off
The Mighty Nein had been traversing northward
towards the Labenda Swamp to make good on the
first of two jobs they had accepted from The
Gentleman back in Zadash Upon traveling
northward you made a young feathered friend by
the name of Kiri whos been under your protection
since You briefly met Cali who is a
dragonblooded sorcerer who joined you for a
length of the journey You managed to discover
where the seemingly cutoff and abandoned safe
house was Beneath it discovered what had been
responsible for it going silent by an underground
tunnel network run by swamp merrow You engaged
with them found a strange altar room where they
had amassed everything they had stolen from the
safe house slaughtered the present shallow priest
and his protectors took what was necessary and
what was of interest from that pile including an
interesting orb made your way back out closed
the pathway the merrow had to the safe house thus
establishing its true safety once more and
completing the job of which you were tasked
There you spent an evening resting and began
heading back out to return from the northern
center of Labenda Swamp towards the town of
Berleben and to where the next leg of your
journey takes you Mighty Nein as you begin
heading southward into the daytime of the thick
heavy swamp what would you like to do
 If I recall you guys had taken a long rest
after your previous battle so now its
midmorning Id say
 What is your marching order if I could
ask
 All righty Whos in the lead guys
 All right Nott
 And Kiri will stay with Jester
 And Frumpkin
 Got it Fjord does that mean youre leading
through Whos responsible for navigating
 Make a survival check please
 Very good
 You follow the pearlhandled daggers along
the treeline until eventually you break southward
to the northern side of the Ounterloch You
continue to follow it southwestward from your
current position curving around the outside of
the lake Eventually you make your way back to
the treeline where you were before At one point
theres a faint shift in the greenery looks like
a vine maybe has moved and you recognizing the
placement of it manage to stop Fjord from
stepping into it As you pull him back you guys
watch as there is now a cluster of vines at the
base of one of these trees and what looks like
thorns on them appear to be jagged and in rows
 You dont know
 You saw a patch of vines that were tangled
at the base of one of these trees that you managed
to stop Fjord before stepping into the area
 Make a nature check
 Make a perception check
 You dont see anybody responsible for that
 All right make an investigation check
 Does not appear to be trapped There are no
other cables or lines you dont see any signs of
anything else either holding any tautness to it
They seem slack
 As you look at them theyre just centered
there at the base They either might be coming out
from under the tree or part of a plant network
right there
 As soon as you hear Beaus words Its good
jerky you watch as the vines suddenly wrap
around where it was and begin to coalesce and
twist around it You watch as they tighten and
tear and hold there
 Then they begin to slowly shift in your
direction The vines 
 Its not very quick You watch as this poor
cluster of jagged vines different than the
mantrap youd encountered before slowly circle
around and eventually give up after you guys very
easily make your distance
 Doesnt seem to have much interest in them
unfortunately
 Pressing on youre heading back to
Berleben or are you searching for this hollow you
found before
 Make another survival check for me please
 You have firm memory of directions You know
which direction youre traveling and you have
 Yeah You dont have the ability to suddenly
know where everything is that youve been You
have a good sense of it and you can guide better
than most given most circumstances But you also
have not grown up in a swamp and after a while
the pattern recognition begins to fade a bit and
you discover after youve been circling for a bit
stumbling upon your own footfalls youve lost
about two hours of travel in the middle of the
swamp
 Knowing that you do take knowledge of the
current source of sunlight above the canopy
Following that heading in the western direction
from where you were eventually you come across
 So are you all staying back
 How far back are you staying
 Here this will make it easy to establish
the scenario
 There is the hollow with the central tree
there
 You guys are coming this direction so north
would be that direction You guys are heading this
way Where would you guys like to be placed
 Its normal ground where its green and then
rough terrain where its water
 Kiri has her dagger out and is currently
 There
 There you go As youre preparing yourself
Kiri looks over to you with a big smile with the
dagger out and goes  I dont know if
its smart
 Roll your stealth with advantage Nott as
you come up along the side
 All right
 As quietly as you can you turn around the
corner walk this little swampy land bridge
dipping down to about your waist in swamp water
but in a very slow steady path begin to emerge
your foot finding the roots at the base of this
large now hollowed tree You turn around the
corner
 Thats true you do actually So you tip
tap across it The softest ninja run youve ever
seen You can almost hear Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairies as you go Glancing inside you do see
currently in the process of chewing something You
hear a crunching sound and then a slurping sound
and then some subtle 
 Do you want to hold actions when it comes to
it
 Essentially it would be a surprise round so
you wouldnt have to worry about holding necessarily
 He doesnt seem to know youre there
 Do you have flint and steel in your
equipment
 Nott scoots back around the corner As you
guys are all waiting patiently
 Its about that long
 Make an intelligence check actually
  You have some understanding of basic
alchemy you know probably the way this is treated
it wont burn super fast Youre not sure You
could have anywhere between  to six seconds once lit
 Wait so where are you then
 Okay so you move over
 Both swords ignited
 So you move over here with Yasha then
 Okay theres now this floating piece of
dynamite just kind of gliding over the swamp You
hear the insects buzzing and various dragonflies
making their way through So you have it now floating
in front of you Yasha
 Its going
 Okay You get right around this corner Make
another stealth check as youve now dillydallied
around for a bit
 Okay
 No idea youre there But there is a faint
 sound and from the inside you see the
shifting movement of the large hulking troll beast
on the inside of the hollow kind of pause for a
second in the middle of chewing
 Silence
 If I could get a pair of scissors please
 Well yeah you blew it apart

 Thank you kindly
 Okay so first off
 Disadvantage on its dexterity saving throw
fails Go ahead and roll d for me please
 A concussive blast blows apart the hollow
You see pieces of shrapnel go flying in every
direction The only one who is not currently
protected is you Nott I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw please
 Well not from the blast This is from the
shrapnel of the tree hollow that has exploded
outwards in all directions
 Youre far enough away where I dont think
it would get to you
 Thats okay You take half damage
 You take three points of bludgeoning damage
from pieces of wood flying in your direction The
troll is however knocked prone

 From a distance yeah However I need
everyone to roll initiative
 Hes aware that you guys are there now
 Well say for the purposes of this Ill give
you each one action to do something
  to 
 A natural  on his Sorry Caleb was
 And Nott was it
  to 
  to ten
 Ten to five
 What you got Fjord
 I think this is a surprise round The troll
cannot act this turn Well just let it go that
way because hed be going up with you Caleb on
the same turn Hes on the ground dazed and
stunned What are you doing
  points of fire damage Nice The bolt
impacts the flame curls across his now currently
black blasted chest and back area The flames as
you noticed in a previous battle has prevented
its regeneration
 From the battles youve had and from
watching the previous strike you now notice the
impact and as the time progresses over the next
round the wounds are not knitting themselves back
together So that finishes your turn Are you
going to move
 Finishing Calebs go Nott youre up
 You have disadvantage because hes currently
prone
 I just wanted to see if you rolled lower
 Good to know First shot misses
 Im letting you guys have a full surprise
round because technically hes dazed
  does not hit
 It manages to ricochet off of the outer
parts of its hide Even though its burnt and
scarred its still thick You watch as the bolt
reflects off it Molly youre up and then Beau
 Spell DC on that is charismabased so its
a ten correct
 All of your racial abilities are
charismabased
 That is a  so it does not succeed
 No sorry I mean
 Meaning your ability does not succeed
Thats your action You still have  feet of
movement if you want do anything
 Perfect
 That finishes Mollys turn Beau youre
up
 Keeping on the green you can get about
there and he is within  feet of you
 You have disadvantage on the attacks
because hes prone
  hits
  misses unfortunately but the first
strike does hit
 Four points of damage to the troll
 As you throw it you watch as it splinters
off of its body and there is a splash of poisonous
toxin
 All right you go into your defensive
stance preparing for any sort of assault towards
you Yasha youre up
 No you didnt
 If you want to yeah
 All right there you go Yasha
 Its up to you If you dont move you dont
get to move later until your next turn So if
youre going to move do it now and then hold
your action for whatever trigger you want
 Over here
 And youre holding an attack
 Okay you are readying an attack for what
Whats the trigger Comes within range Got it
Okay that finishes Yashas turn Jester youre
up
 Right above it
 All right roll for your attack
 Correct Technically its at advantage
because it is prone I imagine its considered a
melee attack
 That definitely hits roll damage on that
  points of damage as the lollipop 
slams down onto its body It rears back This
awkward sickly looking creature being bashed by
beautiful glistening divine lollipop Its a
unique visual
 You mean you used your bonus action for the
Spirit and your action for the
 Wisdom or constitution Wisdom all right
That is a four
 Yeah it is
 Apparently All righty that ends Jesters
go
 All righty Fjord youre up
 All righty strength checks are denied onto
him for disadvantage
 Go for it both at disadvantage
 Misses over top
 That does hit roll damage
 A d from your Hex dont forget that
  technically
 No hes all right I mean he looks hurt
Top of the round Caleb and the troll going at the
same time Because you are going at the same time
with the enemy roll a dexterity check Roll a
d add your dexterity modifier
 Hes going before you Gets up in its space
thats half his movement
  
 Its going to use an action to dash forward
in front of you
 You know what Hes not Hes going to stay
there and instead hes going to go ahead and use
his venom spray It lumbers forward its
darkened with angry blasted soot and flame
scars it rumbles toward you its strange bulbous
midsection wobbling as it steps through the swamp
towards you It looks like an even more swollen
Meg Mucklebones from Legend Reaches up with its
claw and tears a giant wound across its chest As
it does dark green venomous liquid sprays out in
a foot cube in front of it hitting both of
you I need you both to make a constitution saving
throw please It takes seven points of damage
from its own claw
 Okay you just make it The DC was 
 That is exactly what you needed  points
of poison damage to you Yasha and you are
poisoned for one minute
 You take nine points of poison damage Beau
and you are not poisoned
 Yep At the end of each turn you can repeat
the saving throw to try and get rid of the poison
so thats going to end its turn Next Caleb
 Right there
 What level
 Three missiles d plus three go ahead and
roll that up Nott youre up next
 Finishing that Caleb your turns over
Nott what are you doing
 Nope
 That does miss unfortunately
 Each Magic Missile the spray is still
jumping off of its body in these very
proximitybased sprays of terrible toxin So yeah
its still happening
 Are you only making the one attack
 Over here
 As youre rushing past
 Correct
 Six points of damage to it As the bolt
sticks in the back you watch as one of its
bulbous pustules sprays venom behind it impacting
nothing in its proximity
 Between five and ten feet youre not
entirely certain from your visible standpoint
because youre kneeling behind a tree with partial
cover That finishes Notts turn Molly youre
up Then Beau youre on deck
  feet
 In order to make it with your distance
youre going to have to leap across that bit of
open swamp water
 Thatll be the rest of your movement Youll
be right there and thatll be the end of your
movement
 Okay make an athletics check
  You trip and fall down to your
knees in the water   and thats about as
far as you can move on this turn
 You can use an action to dash if you want
 Okay youre holding your attack
 Got it
 Okay Does that end your turn
 Beau youre up
 Your first attempt to spray it it
dissipates in front of you
 You cant throw it  feet to land on his
body You have to throw the actual All right
Roll a d plus your dexterity modifier
 It sees it coming towards it and
 past its head and you hear it
 somewhere in the distance You glance
past it and theres a pile of skulls and bones
that were previously charred from the impact that
currently now are doused in oil
 How much full movement
 All right That ends Beaus turn End of
Beau Yasha youre up
 You can
 Sure Ill let you do that Yeah
 You who are still holding your tinder box
from lighting the dynamite earlier pull out your
pack pull out a torch and it begins to burn
Roll a d add your dexterity modifier
 It does You see behind a pile of freshly
dampened oilcovered skulls burns like a nice
little bonfire behind him
 It looks at it and looks back at you about
as incredulously as a troll can like
 I should have actually rolled at disadvantage 
on that but it would have been the same
 You do at the end of your turn Make a
constitution saving throw
 You manage to shrug off the poison
 Good All right that ends Yashas turn
Jester youre up
  just misses It strikes across its
shoulder but glances off and slams into the wet
sickening swamp floor with a  sound It
has to pull itself out by wedging back and forth
 Oh shit All right Roll your attack
 You watch as behind 
 A tree blasts back from the Guiding Bolt
slamming into already rotted roots needed that
one final nudge and the tree behind uproots
itself and falls
 All right That ends Jesters turn Fjord
youre up
 Go for it Level one What level you have
to
  does hit
 Plus a d because it has Hex on it
  points of damage Im putting this on
there for Witch Bolt so if you wanted to use your
action again you can continue to hit it every
turn for a d automatically Now you see as
Fjord steps around the corner and releases this
arcing bolt of purplishblack energy this
lightning arcs off and slams into the troll The
energy continues to swirl around it It tries to
stop it and grasp for it to no effect Theres
this strange thread of faintly visible energy
between it and Fjord right now Theres some sort
of connection between the two of them All right
that ends your turn Fjord
 The trolls going to go first because it
rolled higher than Caleb Immediately it turns
 No Its real angry at him because it just
got Hexed Blasted and then Bolted Its going to
bypass the shiny swords right there
 It does
 You were holding your action so you get two
attacks yeah
 That does hit
 Ten points of damage as you strike it with
one blade and miss with another Immediately as
you strike across it with your blade the venom
splashes into your face You suffer  points of
poison damage and then it moves out of your
combat range You can still take your reaction if
you wanted to
 Yep
 It does not appear to be undead So its d
plus and then double whatever you roll
 Yeah if you wanted to do it that way
 As you carve past with a third final swing
towards it you cut through a portion of muscle
and tendon on its arm there which immediately
slips dull to one side unmoving The spray
splashes back in your face for only five points of
poison damage
And its coming into you As soon as that
arm goes limp the muscle reconnects and the arm
comes back with strength angrily Its going to
swing Its going to take a bite and two claw
attacks against you
 You cant You already used your reaction to
attack him
 Sorry buddy
 For its bite attack against you its jaws
open Fjord That is going to be a 
 You take ten points of piercing damage plus
six points of poison damage and you are poisoned
until the start of its next turn as the venom
courses through your veins Its teeth and giant
tusks dug into the front of your shoulder and
chest The pain is strong but its holding you
fast From there like a clawed wolverine it
begins to rake at your chest with its claws on
each side The first ones going to be a  to
hit
 Right because you have your shield out The
shield blocks one of the claws The other one
attempts to reach behind it to get to your body
Thats going to be a 
 With the other claw strike
 No He is not That is nine plus four 
points of slashing damage
 And another three points of poison damage
 Thats going to end its turn
 Caleb youre up
 Wisdom save That is a  minus one 
no
 Half movement he can only make a single
attack on its turn
 I need you to make two concentration checks
by the way Your Hex would be gone technically
Which is my fault Hex is gone and make
constitution saving throws to see if youre
maintaining your Witch Bolt
 All righty Good on you
 I assumed as much Okay
 Correct
 All right Caleb that finish your turn
 Nott youre up
 It is
 All righty you move   there
you go
 That hits Roll damage Its hurt real bad
now
  points of damage And splash Fjord you
take nine points of poison damage right into your
face as the bolt slashes through
 Its holding on barely Its right there
angrily making a last stand
 Okay roll damage
 Six points still alive Fjord you take
another  points of poison damage
 Its standing heavily breathing like

 You do
 Youre about to go  The orc
comes to The blood of the halforc kicks in and
you stand there angrily in its face
 All righty that finishes Notts turn
Molly youre up
 Youre up to your waist in swamp water
looking up at it
  that hits
 How do you want to do this
 As you stab through its body it tries to
spin and you watch this strange tensing of its
abdominal muscles and its weird bulbous stomach
suddenly bursts out in front of you Fjord
 Yeah you take ten points of poison damage
 It looked almost like Molly killed them
both
 Fjord is currently unconscious on the
ground guys What are you doing
 As far as you know You dont know
 Okay so roll a constitution saving throw to
resist it
 
 Oh did you amplify
 So you watch as where the snake is the
blood bursts and the green venom thats currently
coursing through the wounds in Fjords unconscious
body suddenly  siphons out hovers
in the air for a moment as Mollymauk is holding
his hand And then the poison drops to the ground
and disseminates into the swamp
 What are you guys doing
 Fjord is still unconscious The poisons
gone but hes
 Make a perception check
 You guys begin to make your way over to
the
 Kiri begins to run around joining over here
in the swamp area
  Its poisonous
Youre looking down at it and watching
as parts of the wounds are still tethering
together
 It hasnt come back to your turn yet
unfortunately Its turns before that You watch
as it suddenly comes up from the ground pulling
itself from the swamp now conscious once more
 And its going to take another heavy swing
towards Fjord With advantage because youre prone
 Thats going to be  to hit
 Thats going to be seven points of piercing
damage and two points of poison
 Fjord falls unconscious once more
 Well it comes back around to the next
turn
 As soon as it comes back it heals ten hit
points back up So it came to consciousness Just
enough movement to get up from prone knock Fjord
down Its going to make another swipe at Fjord
 No it cant
 Its still Slowed yeah
 Oh man
 And it had a third attack
 But it doesnt anymore
 All right Fjord is unconscious Brings us
back Caleb it is now your turn
 As everyones rushed around its got back
up and just  Fjords unconscious
again
 It seemed to
 Any sort of damage seemed to cause it to
splurt
 No That was its turn it just took So now
were going back to the initiative order again
 Real fast hold on Im just checking Slow
 It gets to make a wisdom saving throw to see
if it can avoid Slow No it rolled a three
 So Caleb what are you doing
 Okay what are you doing
 Okay so youre holding until Fjord is clear
from his body Got it Okay that brings us to
Nott Nott what are you doing You turn around
and watch as the trolls now back up and slammed
its claw into Fjords now once again unconscious
body
 Currently You can very easily get within 
feet
 You step around the flaming pile of skulls
right there And turn and get another bolt and
youre holding
 Okay holding the attack until Fjords safe
 You got it All right Molly your turn
 You can
 Where do you want to go
 Right behind the fire
 All right that finishes Mollys turn Beau
youre up
 Figure it out guys its your turn
   You dont even have to to get to
it
 Oh to get to Fjord sorry   thats

   So you have thats your
 Okay so you spend an action just to hold
onto him You currently have him grappled
 Okay got it Yasha
 All right So you move over action and
youre going to pull him away All righty you are
not in melee range so you manage to pull him back
here Fjord you get
 I know he doesnt So you pull him back
Fjord is now right there
 Hmm It gets a little wonky with action but
Ill let you do it
 With the speed you have left you guys can
pull him about there
 Well its half speed through the swamp and
then its half speed dragging somebody So its a
slow shift because youre moving through the muck
and dragging him out of this thick swamp So
thats as far as you can get
 It does not get any reaction though because
its currently still affected by the Slow spell
and it looks like right now Fjord is in a position
where he is outside of the splash radius Which
would trigger Caleb and Nott
 You fire and you are using the Scorching
Ray from the glove
 All hit
 Roll damage No Theres nobody in range of
it right now
 Five points of damage Its still conscious
 How do you want to do this
 As you turn the glove sparking as you
release these three blasts one strikes his chest
and ignites his arm begins to burn black This
one hits the other shoulder and you watch as the
torso begins to ignite The third one finally hits
right in the jaw and you see the shadowed line of
its face eyes and mouth open before fire
crackling Incinerated to ash I need you to go
ahead and make a wisdom saving throw please
 Calebs arms kind of just fall slack and he
slumps to his knees staring at the nowflaming
corpse of the troll as it slumps into the ground
and begins to burn halfsubmerged in swamp water
half of it now just this burning mass of ash and
flesh
 So
 Go ahead and make a death saving throw
 Yeah youre fine all right Its fine I
just like making him roll
 You pull him away Hes not present
currently
 You have to wait a moment because currently
the body is being engulfed Eventually the flames
die down to the point where you can carve into its
body but most of its flesh is burned Its
definitely dead Make a medicine check
 You manage to eventually hack away get to
where the troll heart would be and carve it out
without damaging it beyond any interest in this
piece Its a deep forest green looks like it has
halfformed additional ventricles that never fully
completed Its pretty disgusting and you go to
touch it and your fingers
 Okay You pull it out It is corroding the
cloth slowly
 Its that big Its about basketball size
 Okay Both of you guys make investigation
checks as youre looking through the rest of that
Yasha what are you doing
 Unfortunately the concussive blast of the
dynamite shattered most of the bones and any
materials that were in here so what wouldve at one
time been fairly easy to scavenge what remains
you gather from the patches of now dried and
destroyed swamp ground that much of it has been
scattered all across You do manage to find some
coins between the two of you mostly you Nott
and it takes some digging Youre basically having
to pan for gold here Youre going in the muck and
having to sift through your fingers and pour your
water out a bit take it into the water You
manage to find roughly  gold pieces ten silver
pieces and lets say about  copper pieces
 The body of the troll Make another
investigation check
 Theres basic hides wrapped around the
midsection There is a small pouch You go inside
and pull through and immediately your hands hit
something that feels very cold and somewhat slimy
Looking inside looks like there are slivers of
muscle Fresh muscle that had been torn off of
some sort of a body laid in there The smell is a
little bit putrid It may have been in there
pickling for a while
 You can make a medicine check to try and
identify it
 Ten Probably human
 Caleb you shake out of it
 Yeah okay That it does In revealing the
partially singed troll dong you also manage to
properly wrap the heart for its own use
 Each campaign Its a through line guys
 So Fjord what are you doing
 Okay Caleb you manage to snap out of it
and come back to reality
 Its a pile of bone and skull shards that is
still burning and will be burning for a while from
the oils
 No That flask shattered on impact sorry
You guys take a short rest
 The downside of throwing dynamite into the
reward pile
 You guys finish your short rest Youre
feeling a little more collected What do you wish
to do
 You look around and see Kiri sitting there
with the knife and is stabbing the troll body
 Its not splashing venom it looks like
  This means we are friends
  Dont stab humans Dont eat
humans Okay
 No it seems classic Fjord stomach
 Nine
 All right You guys continue making your way
back towards Berleben You made most of the
journey and by the time the sky begins to subtly
grow dark with the threat of dusk imminent in the
next hour or so you guys begin to make visual on
the lantern lights in the outskirts of the
northern side of the city Within a short time
before it gets too dark in the swamp you manage
to make your way inside Berleben proper
 Youre still in the Puddles
 Okay He cannot respond though right
 Oh can answer in a like manner
immediately
 Seeing as how the spells limit is 
words

 Theres a moment where you hear in your mind
a familiar voice of The Gentleman going I think
I catch your gist Well done Keep trucking You
hear the confused rise at the end
 As you guys are having this conversation
near one of the lanterns you see a cloaked figure
thats sitting on a bench suddenly stand up and
face you and begin to walk towards you
 Youre walking through the Puddles
 The figure approaches Somebody in the tech
sneezed I think
 I know
 The figure approaches and pulls the hood
back and you see a scruffy chin the unkempt
hair a dirtier but excited Horris Thrym
 He goes Well word of a motley group of
strangers spreads in whispers and I knew it had
to be you based on the description My friends
youve come this way This place is miserable Oh
do not think that I dont appreciate what youve
done for me please
 As rough as this journey was Id rather be
here than in prison What word of Zadash has come
Is Dolan all right
 Ive heard whispers of that as well
 Ive been here for over a week so no But
Im sure there was How long should I stay What
is the current atmosphere there
 Is it safe to return or should I hang low a
little longer
 Okay Ill remain in this quaint city
 Thats true Ill be patient Thank you all
so much I really appreciate it
 No I dont But if I do Ill let you
know 
 I genuinely wish to make this up to you at
some point If it is diamonds you require Ill
begin looking
 He stops and looks around the city and goes
I dont know if this is the place Call me crazy but
 Fish swamp fungus herbs
 He steps back
 He starts thinking for a second then goes
Maybe there and points to what is another two
story building that had been burned and left to
rot that now appears to be a hollow structure
that is overgrown with greenery and plants
 It seems to be from what Ive noticed in
passing
 Thank you Thank you all If you see Dolan
tell him please come get me
 Thank you
 Im over at The Drowned Nest
 No theyre better than that place And he
points to The Keystone Pub where you guys stayed
the night
 Not to my standards
 Im sure you could acquire a drink Trust
me most of the folks here have to
 Just precautions Not a lot of business
happens here that you wont get mingled in unless
you were looking So I just stay put
 You as well If you pass by The Drowned
Nest hopefully we could have a drink And he
makes his way up towards the central part of the
town the Midway Docks
 You approach and there is a sign thats
hanging from a chain from two iron hooks that are
long rusted this dull brownred color It reads
across the front The Fungal Fount
 Never enter if its Papyrus
 So you approach The door is closed
currently
 Sorry were closed
 Were closed its sundown and Im
shutting up
 Sunrise
  What
 Make a persuasion check
 You are helping Ill give you advantage on
this roll That was a roller coaster right there
 Theres a moment and you hear multiple
locks clicking The door opens and on the inside
you see a wildlooking gaunt dwarf He has a chin
beard with green moss growing on each side of it
His clothes look a little moist and his forehead
glistens with sweat and he peers through his
eyes popped out You said you have a troll heart
Come in Opens the door and lets you both inside
Closes the door behind  Im sort
of curious as to how you came across this troll
heart Did you kill the troll
 Thats amazing Im very impressed Um
ah
 I would like to very much Place it on
this counter please On the leather which you carried
 He reaches over and grabs metal tongs and
starts pushing
 Im inspecting it
 Takes a moment to look around I can see
theres some very fascinating applications that
could come from this
 It is quite exquisite I would be happy to
buy this off of you Do you have an asking price
or would you like me to make an offer
 Without breaking eye contact he starts
rummaging behind this small wooden table that acts
as his counter Which has a bunch of planters and
potted weirdlooking swamp fungus and plants that
are grown together and entwined One of them you
lean close and a little spore goes off and you
back away carefully You hear the clinking of
glass and he pulls up two small jars opens and
says I could spend the night preparing perhaps
for some medicinal potions 
 Strongest youll find this side of the
Labenda
 I dont know I have to brew it to find
out Its not a perfect art form You are impatient
 Unusual
 Right The morning then
 Smithe Smithe Durban Pleasure to meet
you
 They havent invented the zipper yet so
its laced
 Very well Goodnight sleep well Return
please Closes the door 
 So what are you guys doing for the evening
 You head to the Midway Docks Following the
outskirts of the Drydocks which are a number of
these wooden docks that head out into various
edges of the swamp where there are small boats
that are currently roped off and being watched by
the crownsguard that come across with torches
make sure that nothing gets stolen or anyone is
doing anything untoward over in the area Asking
around you eventually find your way to a
relatively simplelooking building Single story
but it stretches quite a bit and you can see a
number of windows that are faintly glowing with
candlelight On the inside it does appear to be
a simple inn with a small bar in the far corner
Its better than the Keystone Pub but only
incrementally Entering inside its relatively
quiet Looks to be one person who is drinking
alone on the far end and you see across the way a
female human in her middle age a warm smile with
a cracked face who glances up from a small book
that she is thumbing through and goes Good
evening folks Can I help you
 Well I can provide both My name is Uma
Cole Pleasure to meet you
 Oh no I keep quite clean
 I was trying to process what that was
referring to Oh you stop No the hand was clean
 We do have about four rooms available for
rent if yall are willing to stay for the evening
Our selection of liquors and beers are not
extremely versatile but welcome to provide as needed
 Very well That will be five silver per
room for the nights stay
 All four rooms That will be two gold
pieces please
 What a gentleman
 Well good for you
 Course not Im sorry
 Herere your keys Strangely surrounded by
a group of strangers now accosting her with
various degrees of insinuation Drinkswise we
prefer more hard liquors or more of an ale beer
 Well only a couple of surprises at my
disposal but
 She pulls up this dark green bottle and
uncaps it Its beer but its practically ginger
ale Not very alcoholic She hands it over to
you
 A round of liquor for all of you guys will
run you about three silver pieces Its not very
expensive
 Oh nothing And she tucks it under Just
keeping my mind busy Anyway welcome to stay if
you like We dont have food available here You
may have to go over to the Keystone Pub for that
But we do offer finer sleeping arrangements
 Not to the degree that you have no
 Kiri at this point is leaning up on the
counter towards the woman And goes 
Dont eat humans okay The woman goes Aw
 Make a deception check
 She goes Children and their costumes
 She grabs her book and starts reading from
behind the counter
 Actually its just plain leather
 So what are you guys doing
 You got your drinks Theyre functional at
best This isnt a bad establishment but its a
plain establishment But it works Its you guys
and one other patron who currently seems to be
deep in their cups making it on their own They
are out of earshot you have your own table
 Okay she goes Oh of course Ill go
ahead and get that for you She closes the book
and puts it beneath the counter and runs off and
grabs the bottle that she had previously poured
and shakes it Its fairly empty so she grabs
another and then heads over to your table and
begins to uncork and fill the drinks
 Okay you do not see where it is You still
have to have visual
 Make a stealth check
 Okay she walks and is pouring drinks and
looks over her shoulder in your direction and is
still pouring but is looking at you
 Apparently
 You do see it from your perspective but she
is watching you
 Make a persuasion check
 She finishes pouring the drinks caps it up
and goes Well I appreciate the flattery I
really do Have a wonderful night Then walks
back towards where she was sitting but as she
does so her eyes are locked on you Nott Goes
back to her stool
 Can I help you
 Roll a persuasion check
 Shes had a bad series of minutes with you
guys
 Im reading a fine story
 It is
 I had to order this from Zadash
unfortunately
 Well the order goes out there and pay
upon delivery It took me the better part of a
month to get here
 Im about three chapters in Its just
starting to get interesting
 Yes
 Make a perception check
 Theres a little bit of text just barely
visible at this proximity to the cover of the
book but you cant make it out in this low
light
 She takes it and closes it and puts it
beneath the counter Is there anything else I can
help you with sweetie
 Shes just pulled the book out and looks up
and goes Hi
 Make an intimidation check
 Well it depends on how youre being
intimidating Are you going to physically threaten
her to show the book
 Then its charismabased
 This is subtle
 She goes I apologize but southern
drawl I apologize
 But your behavior paid customer or not
has been lackluster and I would appreciate if I
could have my privacy
 Why are you so interested in what Im
reading
 Dungeons and Dragons
 All right You guys finish up your
respective drinks
 She palms the two gold She goes Its
called Feathered Leather
 She pockets the gold happily
 Some bard somewhere in the past has penned a
story about a dark knight in leather and feathers
 You guys manage to get your evenings rest
You gather your things and the next morning
 As youre talking you hear in your mind
this gasp Jester I dont know how but its so
good to hear from you Did you get my package
 She pauses Well wherever you are I love
you and I hope you are well If and it cuts off
 I wasnt counting the words but I think
that gets the gist of it Probably somewhere in
there Im sure Ill get  tweets going like
That was only  words Its fine
 I know Oh I know Taliesin Thats why Im
nipping this in the bud Yeah
 As it emerges from your grasp you can see
theres the slight splash of sea water across the
wall There you can see in the center of the
pommel previously was just the wellcrafted hilt
to the blade you see a single yellow lidless
eye on each side
 Make an arcana check
 Theres no religious symbology here In
thinking through theres nothing that gives you
the essence that theres any sort of belief system
locked into this that youre aware of Looking at
of it and the seabased theme of these experiences
that Fjord has been having leads you to believe
that this is something very old and something
that resides probably beyond land and possibly
beyond the sea Thats as much as I can give you
Which is more than you shouldve gotten but you
rolled a 
 Currently its just static
 Okay For the next minute you have
advantage on your charisma checks
 It doesnt do anything to you it just gives
him advantage on charisma checks
 Youre doing Charm Person
 Make a wisdom saving throw
 He resists it You feel your mind begin to
cool with subtle arcane influence and you shrug it off
 Sword of Sea Eye give me sight beyond
sight Go ahead and make an intelligence check
Just a straight roll with your intelligence
modifier
 Ten You grab it and you focus and you
focus and much like an element of the dreams
youve had and the spells that you pull from
whatever this agreement youve made with this
entity may have been you can feel that thread
connection from you to something beyond your
hemisphere Its like that sensation of someone
looking at you and you just know someones
looking at you and you turn to look and theres
nobodys there Its like that all the time
right now But you cant read more than that
 Okay As we go to rest for the evening
lets go ahead and make this our break So well
come back here in just a few minutes to pick up
the story for the next leg of your journey In the
meantime guys enjoy these next few minutes
Enjoy the videos and chaos in between Well see
you here shortly

 Welcome back everybody Lets go ahead and
dive back in As you all come to consciousness the
following morning a much more comfortable sleep
than that you had at the Keystone Pub you
gather your things Upstairs there are a few more
patrons in the process of waking up since there is
not a meal provided for sleeping here They are
just getting out the grogginess having some
coffee some of them having some hair of the dog
and they all go about their business What do you
want to do with your day
 Okay She goes To pick up your money at
the stables you say on the docks how can I
assure them that Im allowed to do so if I did not
check them in
 You forge it
 You have a forgery kit
 All right You guys go ahead and head off You
gather the cart easy enough to do You gather
your supplies theyre all good to go You guys
are heading towards the Fungal Fount
 Kiri pipes up She says  Get
into trouble
  Get into trouble
 
  You know Okay
 Turns to Nott as you guys walk off
 Wrapped around his weenie

 You continue making your way to the edge 
of the swamp The two of you
 You guys make your way to the Fungal Fount
The doorway is partially ajar It is open
 You guys make your way into the Fungal Fount
and there you see waiting anxiously theres the
sallow dwarf sitting in a small chair in the
corner going Ah so where is the heart Did you
bring it
 Right okay So Ive been working on
something for you based on what you requested and
I have these He puts these two vials on the
table One of them is a healing potion larger
than the basic kind The other is a sky blue
color and as he sets it on the table as soon as it
impacts theres a flash and you see some sparkles
kind of going  through it before
it settles And he goes Im going to be honest
not entirely certain the extent of what this is
It protects you from something I know the basis
of it is insulation
 I do not see what you mean
 He taps it again and  It
looks like a spark
 I dont know But I bet its interesting
 I will trade these and put a topper of 
gold pieces
 Youre totally pulling a Grog
 All right If you dont mind
 He grabs the leather and carefully moves it
off the table and puts it in a small chest closes
it Goes and counts out  gold pieces shoves it
your way and goes Thank you for your patronage
 Depends on what youre looking for I have
various balms and salves to help with headaches
wounds that are festering Some that help with
helping your manhood come to light some that help
you with sleeping if youre having insomnia
 Essentially over about five minutes of him
showing you around theyre mostly general herbal
remedies for day to day ailing elements It looks
like all the special stuff that he had at his
disposal went into those potions Everything else
has been general helping like melatonin Things
that help you a little bit
 All right Thats five silver for ten
doses
 There are some lavender oils I would
recommend to you Here it is I hope you like it
Its quite nice He rubs some on his wrist
Yes
 For the oils and your sleeping Ill put it
around Ill say seven silver pieces
 I can He gives you three silver back
 You guys finish up there
 Okay You guys are heading off to the edge
of the swamp with Kiri
  Make an investigation check one
of you with advantage if youre aiding the other
 Sure
 All right What particularly are you looking
for
 Okay It takes you upwards of ten minutes
not very long until you find one thats roughly
that size Its not perfectly spherical Its got
its imperfections but its pretty smooth
 Ill say theres a very faint ring around
it sure
  Go fuck yourself

 
 All righty Make a sleight of hand check if
you dont mind Ill give you advantage if you
manage to succeed on a deception check
 Well I have many possible uses I could
extract all sorts of
 So just make a roll
 With a quick flourish you complete a fairly
accurate recreation of the font utilized in its
glorious Papyrus without him noticing from behind
the door With that you go and complete your
conversation The rest of you meet up just as you
hear the clomping of horse hooves All of you
gather in the center of the Puddles The clomping
is this splashing as theres still two inches of
water in this section of Berleben 
 You guys take a moment to look through
Everythings intact
 Kiri comes up  Shes probably
a good egg
  Yeza was his name The halfling
man From before

  Shut up Shut up Kiri Shut
up
  Yeza
  Yeza was his name The halfling
man From before
 All right You guys gather your things get
back onto your cart and your horses and head
southward exiting Berleben leaving this swamp
town behind hopefully for good Making your way
back onto the road Which direction are you going
You have a map
 You guys heading to Hupperdook on the way
 Those are high mountains
 The Silberquel Ridge is a very high series
of mountains
 There are roads or there is cutting through
the open fields and nature Thats your choice to
make Looking at the map here
 You guys are heading this direction As far
as you know Shadycreek which is over here in the
corner
 Make an insight check both of you
 As far as shes aware shes telling the
truth
 You guys are making your way along the
Rillway Road eastward from Berleben heading from
here along Rillway Heading past north of
Felderwin hitting the Felderwin Tillage and then
theres a crossroads that leads to the northern
Gravelway Path
 If youre following the roads If you guys
are cutting away from the roads and going through
the rough open fields that can be done
 Via road its about  miles to the
crosswo crossroads and then  miles along the
Gravelway Path
 Its about a weeks worth of travel to get
to Hupperdook from where you are
 Youll find out when you get there You
havent traveled there before
 You may have been there actually The
crossroads from what your experience is folks
who are making long travels stop there and might set up
shop for a day or two to sell or trade whatever
wares they have before they continue on the rest
of their journey And people from Felderwin and
the Felderwin Tillage head up there sometimes to
set up shop if there are people that are traveling through
 Kind of Its less a town its maybe a
handful of anywhere from four to  tents
depending on what time of year it is
 Its a fantasy outlet
 Oh my god guys
 Okay She draws the best she can Her
drawings are rudimentary but functional You see
two blackbird parents in somewhat geometric
clothing
 Basically Best you can tell from what she
writes down and communicates with you via the
book they were traveling from the east heading
west
 They are yeah
 You guys make your way out of Labenda Swamp
heading southward across the bridge past the river
that breaks from the Ounterloch heading south
 Because this is a longer journey Im not
going to drag us through every single stage of it
But there are some elements that can happen during
this journey
 Yes exactly
 Unfortunately given the lack of details
lack of information
 The Sending spell isnt able to connect with
anybody unfortunately but you tried First day
of travel comes to a close you reach the river
Actually you dont quite reach the river you
almost do First nights rest happens For
expediency who wants to make the perception check
for the evenings rest
 Both individually
 Both of you guys roll
 Thats better For the evenings rest
taking your breaks keeping watch throughout the
night no incident At one moment there is a
shifting of movement in the distance Fjord you
go and check and there is a family of foxes that
are making their way through the field southward
away as it gets colder Theyre starting to move
southward and you spook them off to get away from
the traps
 The next morning you guys get yourselves
back up into the cart and continue on further You
pass beyond the river and start making your way
towards the crossroads before your second day
comes to completion Whos going to keep watch the
next evening All right make the roll guys
 Keeping watch throughout the evening
thankfully no issues happen You manage to keep
watch evening goes without issue Your rest is
fine and you continue onto your third day of
travel Along the way you do finally reach the
crossroads here As you come upon the area you
see where the road diverges It continues in a
southward curve and then a road that very starkly
turns left and heads in a northeastern direction
There are a series of wooden signs up and you do
see three tents of varying sizes There is a blue
and white striped tent a white tent and a faded
green one A couple of carts are stopped off to
the side and some folks are looking in there It
looks like a very small merchant setup there but
if you were to inquire you could see whats
available
 Frumpkin listens about and there are folks
asking and trying to haggle prices You get the
sense that one of them as Frumpkin looks up has
a small selection of fruits some looking more
tropical probably further southsourced brighter
oranges and yellow in color some with vibrant
green leaves
 The white tent goes by has more of a
general goods feel There are tools repair kits
for travel You see some bolts two crossbows in
the back wall all sorts of general tools It
looks to be a general store and some basic means
to defend oneself when on the road
 Make a perception check
 No books The green one appears to be mainly
furs and leathers some that are tanning on the
outside as well as bone jewelry made of teeth and
bone of hunted animals
 If you start walking and glancing through
No Theyre all various travelers No one has
crossed your path before nobody of significance
to your previous experience no
 You head to the green tent those who are
going to the one that has the bone jewelry There
is a human woman there dark weathered skin
leather and fur over her shoulders Shes
currently talking with somebody and as you
approach Terribly sorry If youre looking for
furs bones or leathers look around Feel free
to ask I will tell you what we are selling for
 Thats unfortunate but we do She turns
around and theres a few strips of leather that
are rough on the edges but functional One of them
has a fur inlay so it feels comfortable on the
wrist Ive made these myself
 These are leather
 The wristband that she has is leather yeah
 Are you looking for bone in particular
 There is bone jewelry Theres a bone choker
thats a series of finger bones that are lined end
to end that goes around the neck theres one that
can go on the wrist looks like theres a necklace
that has a bunch of various canine teeth not
necessarily from a canine but sharp teeth from
some sort of creature
 Oh most of these were taken from various
wolves dire in nature
 Wolves
 These are from the Zemni Fields near
Icehaven is where I hail Its a very
huntertrapper community up there I bring the
goods to sell this far south
 Mainly meant only to sell but if you have
something worth buying do present please Im
curious
 She takes it By the way the gator skin is
not tanned Its not cured It is fucking nasty
As you pull it out of your haversack its
dripping with congealed blood Flies immediately
start gathering and shes like Ugh
 I can tell Not interested sorry
 Okay you didnt ask how much it was
 The bone bracelet runs you two gold Its
not that expensive
 Okay For the set of warm clothes which is
heavy leathers and fur that you can throw over a
leather cloak as well that you can bundle up in
and it straps over and buckles multiple times
across the way For you it runs past your legs
almost so youd have to trim it up a bit but
that one will run you three gold pieces
 As you approach the white tent you see a
female halfling there who is wearing a leather
apron that has some tools tucked in there Theres
nobody currently at the station so as you
approach she looks out to you She has frizzy
brown hair with some gray ones that are starting
to sprout from the outside thats pulled back and
held in this giant poof of a ponytail She looks
out toward you and points and goes Oh hello
Looking to buy something
 Oh great What are you looking for
 Problems I have possibly some
solutions
 Thats a problem
 Tents tents I can do Two gold per tent
We have five ready If you need four throwing
those all together if youre buying a tent
 Theyre twoperson tents each
 Five twoperson tents Youre buying me
out Thats ten gold my friend
 Passes them over Theyre all rolled up and
ready to go As far as repair kits go these are
a little pricier If youre looking specifically
for cart repairs one kit I can sell to you for
say  gold pieces That contains all that youd
your axle equipment for keeping your horses
attached to your cart
 Raw canvas I can do but beyond that the
rest of its up to you
  gold for that
 All right Rolled canvas here Ive got
about  square feet of rolled canvas Will that do
 Will it do
 Reasonable Its weatherresistant
 For the treated canvas if youre taking
the whole bolt thats going to be five gold
  gold and with the tents that puts it
at  gold
 Define little bit of lumber For the
structure
 I dont have much in the way of lumber I
have a few
 Theres no bamboo There are wood slats but
no superlong pieces that could be curved over
  gold
 Make a persuasion check
 The days grow colder friend
Unfortunately Ive got to make ends meet
  gold Fantastic thank you
  total
 Anything else you guys need
 What is Fjord doing right now
 Checking Tinderbox
 What do you look like when
 No You do not
 Anything else you guys wish to do Or do you
move on Okay With your supplies gathered you
load up back into your cart and now shifting over
NW  Rillway Road to BerlebenLabenda Swamp NE 
Gravelway Path to HupperdookSilberquel Ridge and
then S  Rillway Road to FelderwinAlfield
 Making the left turn onto that road heading
northeast you begin to make your way towards the
Silberquel Ridge
 Kiris sitting there on the edge eyes
halfclosed and her feathers all puffed up She
looks over towards you 
  Yes
 Okay easy enough It costs you three silver
to get the proper thick fur material to give her
enough to keep warm
 Eh beggars cant be choosers in this
circumstance but you get something functional
 Continuing northward as the sky gets subtly
darker and darker preparing for what is the
coming dusk you see ahead a caravan of carts
heading southward along the road thats going to
intersect with your path
 A caravan of four carts heading your
direction heading southward and going to cross
your path
 Make a perception check
 Okay Glancing ahead theres still enough
light for you to make out details They appear to
be mostly human from what you can tell Looking
behind there looks to be a group of dwarf family
members all gathered They appear to be families
 They dont They look like wagons And as
they begin to approach they turn and give you a
wide berth like theyre about to make room to
travel past you guys
 The gentleman at the front puts a hand up
and the carts slow down a little bit Nothing
just passing through
 Roads are clear so far
 Make a perception check
  There are men women children Mostly
human Three of the carts one of them is a dwarf
family They all look somewhat nervous General
looking out quieting the kids
 We rode past didnt stop
 No
 No Im sorry we must be going
 The horses pick up their pace a bit more
 The kids just kind of watch quietly as they
begin to pass
 He looks back and says Were heading
south
 Were just passing through Heading
south
 The kid kind of recoils from this
blueskinned horned tiefling all of a sudden
engaging him from across the way The kid just
kind of freezes in place
 Okay
 Theres a pause and the kid that youre
aiming at goes Like big smile on the face
Looks over and sees you and kind of No were
just getting away from our home
 Nogvurot
 Well this is where youre going and
Nogvurot is this way
 You can go straight or you can arc itll
take more time
 You can hit it on the way back Its up to
you
 Uh with the days of travel Id have to
go do the math again and Im sure that the
Internet knows and has been keeping track
 Ill check in with CritRoleStats to make
sure
 But since youve left just estimating right
now Id say its been about a little over a week
as of now
 You have a month
 All right You pass the caravan and they
continue southward Eventually it gets dark if
you guys want to stop and make a rest for the
evening you can So as you set off and set up
camp whos keeping watch this evening
 All right And you do have new tents which
is much more comfortable than the open air
bundled up with your blanket in the cold night
And as you travel further north you know its
going to get colder especially with the winter
looming and the autumn coming to a close
 All right whos keeping watch
 All right go ahead and make a roll guys
Or one of you with advantage Your choice
  Okay
 Not biome Biodome
 All right The evening passes without issue
actually Keeping a watch
 Well
 Touche
 So You wake up the next morning You get
the sense that being the vigilant beast that you
are if anybody wanted to come close to inspect
immediately saw Yasha and went Nope You
continue on the next day of travel Heading
upward Northeast further and further You can
begin to see the edge of the Silberquel Ridge the
mountain range that when you were approaching the
Labenda Swamp began to rise and kind of loomed
over the swamp and then began to slowly get more
distant As you traveled southward the crossroads
begins to come further into view again The
mountain range moving closer more massive kind
of peeking over this large its very very
steep edges to the base of this mountain range
You get the sense that passage over or through is
very specific Or at least nowhere in visible
sight As you guys begin to crest into dusk for
this next fourth evening of travel whos keeping
watch
 All right You guys go ahead and roll
perception checks please
  All right As you guys are just setting
up Caleb youre looking out past as everyone
else is getting ready to bed for the night and
you look over and you can see what looks like a
shape off in the grass Looks like a like a big
mound but its hard to tell from this distance
but theres something in the grass
 All right So make a stealth check please
 Still a natural one
 As you begin to slowly approach make a
perception check please
 Sure
 All right You hear nothing You glance
around the corner and just beyond the grass you
can see an overturned cart
 Not yours Another cart Its just on its
side It looks like it has a cover over the top of
it But its not
 You saw the shape And the shape as you
approach looks to be an overturned wagon roughly
about  feet off the road
 Walks over there Make a perception check
 
 Nothing
 Okay
 Make a perception check
  You see a brief a splitsecond of
movement And you look and you see a crossbow bolt
hit the edge of the cart
 Near where he was standing Who is still
dancing
 Not from this distance no
 As all of you come to consciousness you
glance over and you can see the dark shape once
Caleb points out the direction where it was And
as youre coming around the side Nott because
you did not roll a very good stealth
 You suffer six points of piercing damage as
a crossbow bolt catches you in the thigh
 All right You glance over to the side and
you can see what looks to be a humanoid shape that
darts down into the grass and begins shifting
around the other side of the cart
 Yeah It ran down through the grass
actually make a perception check just as youre
trying to peer through the darkness here
 Yeah you have no idea They vanished into
the grass and moved what you assume to be around
the cart
 All right The rest of you following
 All right You guys are all
 Not carefully just straighton run in that
space
 Youre still stealthing
 Id like all of you guys to make a stealth
check please As you try and carefully approach
At the slow pace at which you are approaching at
that many feet away
 Nice
 Natural one
 Four Okay Fjord and Molly lumbering across
the field In the meantime two other figures
jump up from aside the cart and both take
crossbow shots at you Thats going to be a 
 Just hits And the other one is thats a
 That doesnt hit
 So this one youre going to take four
points of piercing damage
 Okay They both kind of duck down behind
using the cart to put a buffer between you and them
 You know where they are yes
 Correct
 You guys are rushing in that direction You
can see you see two figures dart up and then Nott
kind of like  Nott is very visible in
the field
 Okay you Invoke Duplicity As Jesters
stealthing below through the field two Jesters
suddenly appear where once there was one
 All right Molly and Fjord you guys rush
forward as the little globes of light all of a
sudden light the area up a bit like it has a very
faint lantern light in the vicinity
 Okay Fjord
 All right As you guys rush around Yasha
what are you doing
 Okay you guys swing wide around At this
point you see the figures five of them all pop
up two of them in the field off to the side that
you werent paying attention dart up and the
three from behind go ahead and the three are going
to take shots at Nott as well in the center
Thats  Thats an  And  So thats six
points of piercing damage six points of piercing
damage and seven points of piercing damage
Notts just being pummeled by bolts and as Fjord
and Molly start rushing up a fifth one off to the
side goes ahead and makes a shot towards Molly
Thats going to be a  to hit
 You take seven points of piercing damage
and the other one goes and aims towards Molly and
goes Wait Oh God Stop stop stop Stop your
fighting You see the other dark figures look
Their heads swing over in that direction What are
you guys doing
 Okay the one thats closest to you is the
one that shot Molly He popped out of the grass as
you were pulling around the side
 No the other one The one thats shouting
is on the opposite end
 Id say if youre looking at where the cart
is theres two on the sides here that were in the
grass and theres three that are directly behind
the cart
 Theyre about  feet apart
 Well you have to release it next round or
the spells lost
 Okay You prepare youre readying Slow
 Theres very little light except for a
little bit of light thats coming from the sky
The globes are like a lantern light but its the
middle of the night so you can see the shapes
Theyre not able to hide at the moment but you
dont see any features or details as youre
rushing up Make a perception check
 They are aware
 You do notice that all of them have thick
green cloth masks that cover the front of their
faces banditstyle that cover most of the
features
 Go for it As you rush up go for it
 He just finished firing
 Okay go for it
 The first attack you do because he turns
and sees you at the last minute as you approach
  hits
 All right Stunning Strike
 Yeah it spends a ki to do it Yeah he does
not succeed He rolled a natural eight Hes
 kidney punch right to the side
 Roll with advantage because hes stunned
currently
 You  and his eyes roll back
 The one guy stands up the guy who yelled
out and goes We are so sorry We are so sorry
We didnt know it was you folks Our most sincere
apologies The other guy is like What the fuck
are you talking about Hes like You dont
understand These are the ones that
 These are the ones that ashed Trevor The
guys put up their hands Oh shit Were so
sorry They drop their crossbows
 We didnt mean nothing Were so sorry
 Go for it
 Its leather armor It hits Theyre not
very strong
 He goes Oh Come on
 We dont have much Were so sorry
Seriously this is a huge misunderstanding
 Thank you Thank you
 Make a persuasion check
 Aw No
 He pulls the mask down Take the cart Take
it Thats yours Well just The other ones
like What the fuck are you doing mate Hes
like Trust me
 Whatevers in it its all yours
 Right that we do Guys gentlemen back
away
 It belonged to someone Theyre alive We
didnt kill them but we took their stuff and we
sent them on their way
 No
 No
 Okay make an investigation check
 Make an investigation check
 First off glancing inside and looking
through and rummaging and pulling most of the
cart stuff is gone It has some simple grain bags
and things that were placed deliberately to look
like it had a lot and they shoved all of it
towards the exits of the two sides of the cover
but the interior of it is mostly empty You see
two blankets Thats about it
 Obviously not very well right now
 Look this is embarrassing enough as it is
Its hard enough to make ends meet Were doing
what we need to to survive Were happy to give
you this Well walk away and pretend this never
happened
 What I dont understand
 He grabs the armor and tucks it in Thank
you
 Right no Yeah
 Two of the guys go like Yeah no shes
got a point I know
 Make a deception check with advantage
 Hes nodding You can see the sweat on his
brow and you cant help but notice the darkening
spot in his nether regions Of course no
worries sir I promise no worries Well go and
well slop pigs Well do what it takes anything
but this Right boys Theyre like The fuck
You pissed yourself
 Yeah They pick up their crossbows and
tuck them under their arms Good night Safe travels
 Good night The guy next to you as youre
patting him down two things One you manage to
get about seven silver from him Thats all the
money he has on him at the moment
 You find a hard spot on the side of his
stomach that he should probably get checked out
 Because he doesnt have anything else but
she rolled a  investigation check I didnt know
what else
 At this point theres a sound behind you a
 You see Kiri running with her knife
going  I kill people
 There you go Write that down in your
equipment
 Bandit pants
 There you go He starts to come to
consciousness
 His friends have all run off northward
 Hes drooling down himself
 You guys are about here
 Yeah youre about  miles away from the
crossroads
 You dont see them at the moment
 Whats the range on that
 Pantsless with a crossbow and a simple
shortsword thats tucked off to his side
 His hair is filled with flowers hes on his
side flopping away from the sky The carts there
if theres anything you need to grab from it
 There you go
 Theres a couple blankets theres grain
and it has a cover on it
 The cart is comparable probably a little
more weathered than the one you guys have
 Its a basic canvas Its a tan
 Its a tan light brown
 Yeah
 Essentially Ironic that you went looking to
build that and it was already in the possible
path All right So you guys pull that off
 Take the blankets Make your way back to
your cart Finish up your evenings rest and at
morning light continue your way northward along
the road All righty
 For the sake of brevity since were getting
towards the end of the evening
 The next two days go on without issue
Passing a few travelers heading southward
crossing your way until eventually the
Silberquel Ridge grows more and more prominent in
your line of sight Following the path the fields
that surround the north road begin to give way to
tall grass and trade for scrub land and rocks the
oncevanishing shape of the Silberquel Ridge
mountains growing bigger and bigger the numerous
columns of mingling blackandwhite smoke you can
now see spill from the eastern side of the
mountain diffusing as they rise As you travel
even closer you can make out the twotiered
layout of a city built into the mountain One
large region encircles the very base of the
mountain ahundred or more dark workshops and
towers billowing smoke from chimneys and stacks
visible A number of large constructions dot the
open spaces between these towers some oversized
cannons or others like mobile siege towers One
resembles a wheeled multitiered cart with
numerous wickedlooking boltthrowers attached
As you begin to head in this direction you can
also see that this lower area this industrial
field of various engines of warfare that are in
the process of being constructed some in their
skeletal phase of being built To the base of the
mountain above that you can see two winding
switchback roads as well as one very steep
staircase that ascends to a second level about a
hundred or more feet above the first Here you see
a massive outcropping of leveled rock that holds
the other half of the city There along the ridge
of the mountain shelf lies hundreds of buildings
and arches occasionally dappled with an
autumncolored tree Behind this city mass you
see a shimmering waterfall that cascades from out
of the center of the mountain about  feet up
that glimmers like silverwhite light and the
little bit of sun thats coming through the
clouds Youve reached the outskirts of
Hupperdook
 From best you can tell from this
perspective make a perception check
 Its hard to tell The buildings that are in
the outside of the upper ridge look to be varying
sizes They dont appear to be super tiny by any
means You do see from this perspective as youre
heading down to the base of the mountain youre
at the top of the hill and this last leg as you
start pushing in towards Hupperdook at the base
of where the waterfall is hitting behind that
row you can see what look to be numerous towers
thin and tall like these weird needles of
buildings that kind of cluster around the base of
the waterfall Thats as much as you can make out
at this distance
 The technology as you get closer and closer
and begin seeing these fields of construction the
industry is pretty prominent Its the most youve
ever seen As far as the beauty of a living
civilized town five or six maybe
 Its not podunk by any means
 Yeah Its wellbuilt It seems
comfortable
The base area around the mountain as you
begin to approach and you can see now where the
clouds and bits of steam are mingling and rising
up mixing into the sky above you the colors here
metals And immediately you can see the ground
itself
 You can see the ground itself as you step in
the area has a faint layer of soot where some of
the burned materials that are pressed up into the
air have come down to settle onto the ground
surrounding it What do you wish to do
 Its midafternoon
 Following the path there is a large
metallic archway that rises into a pointed
entrance where as you enter you can see in the
metal carved in various rivets HUPPER DOOK
on the other side There you see two townsguards
standing there both human standing guard And as
you approach one of them steps forward Welcome
What is your business
 Understood You would probably want to go
ahead and head up the mountain for that Down here
is all industry
 He points out This is the Iron Lot and the
Assembly Yard Youre going to want to head up to
the Idleworks Shelf to find lodging
 Idleworks Shelf yes
 The most prominent and most lively would
probably be the Blushing Tankard tavern
 He steps back to his post and just keeps an
eye as you guys enter in the midsection At this
point you begin to hear the actual industry here
Theres this faint buzzing and clicking sound as
you see some of these large wheels that are
affixed to the outside of these large towers are
grinding You can see platforms rising up with the
gears turning And on them you can see numerous
gnomes male and female in the process of what
looks to be building materials lifted onto higher
levels You could see some of these war machines
that are being developed and designed here
midconstruction You get the sense that with the
call of war theyre probably put into high gear
in developing whatever siege weapons they can
possibly muster in the short time frame And the
furnaces are going well
 From what you can see from the distance
you can see they have some largerwheeled
platforms that have boltthrowers which are
large imagine a crossbow but on a massive
scale The giant metallic spear that gets flung
from it at a really really powerful speed You
see three or four affixed to a single platform
Youre not sure what animal would be able to pull
that You also see siege towers  feet tall
wheeled with a number of ladders and platforms
inside that are used to clamor up against
fortresses You see one that looks almost like a
giant battering ram that is in the process of
being constructed The interior metal rod is
currently resting on the ground next to it and
theyre building an outer frame Looking past on
the far end on the northern end you can see a
huge cannon maybe about  feet across and about
three to four feet wide in the middle That one is
on a platform The wheels are currently resting in
the side and theyre in the process of finishing
the construction of the device Make a perception check
 Okay Just beyond that on the northern
side as you guys are riding past and you kind of
get as much height as you can beyond these towers
and what was referred to earlier as the Assembly
Yard which is the area where all these war
machines are being built you can see a roped
section that is just pockmarked craters and
scarred ground what you assume to be some sort of
a testing ground for whatever theyve been working
on over the numerous decades or more theyve been
here Youre not sure actually roll a history
check because Im curious to see how much you
know about this
 Ill allow it this time but usually you
have to decide that before you make the roll Its
not a lucky feat so
 But going forward
 Okay You havent learned that much about
the history of Hupperdook You know its been here
for a while
 This city Its been here for quite some
time so while youre not sure of how long that
field has been there you get the sense that this
isnt a recent testing ground It probably has
been their general testing ground for any
technology theyre developing
 Glancing about you see more crownsguard
attire though now youre starting to get to more
gnomish crownsguard who are established there And
on their backs as opposed to spears or shields at
the ready you see similar weapons to what some of
the army moving eastward were carrying You see
long metal rods affixed with a wooden buttress at
the end These strange firearms that have been
carefully relegated to certain individuals here
are a little more in use here
 Make a perception check
 Not yet
 Make a perception check
 Purple horseshoes
 Red balloons
 As you guys are clopping along you look
down and most of the land here is fairly barren
The outskirts of this whether it be just the
heavy amount of smoke and soot thats put out by
the industry there isnt a lot of grass What is
here is pretty harsh scrubland You glance down
though and one of the small bushes does have a
very uniquelooking white bud They havent opened
yet but theyre beautiful amongst this stark
ground And you could reach down if you wanted to
 You grab pluck a couple of them and put
them in your book Okay
 The ones you talked to earlier No You
moved on from them but there are other
crownsguard in the area You can hear the heavy
sounds of metal clanging and the occasional sparks
in the distance of some sort of welding process being
done on some of the distant towers You can see
on the opposite side of the southern side dozens
and dozens of dark metallic warehouses and
buildings that are junctured by hallways There
are small compounds that are focused on whatever
their specific businesses are in these designated
delegated areas Its weirdly almost drab and
dystopian in a visual perspective When you come
to the base of the mountain here where you see
that large very steep staircase you were looking
at there are the switchback pathways up there
But as you approach you hear this  And
looking up you can see these chains these big
heavy dark chains that are shifting And as it
does you can see this platform begin to lower
from the city above heading in your direction In
front of you at the base of the mountain you can
see there are a few other individuals that are
sitting there waiting patiently You can see this
platform eventually comes down seems to be one of
many means to make your way to the second part of
the city
 Its a lift
 All right As you approach you see there
are four crownsguard one dwarven three gnomish
that are there waiting it You see the few figures
that were waiting patiently They appear to be
welldressed human one halfelf wearing what
looks to be reds and gold velvets They look
to be relatively welloff standing definitely out
of place in this rather dark space They step onto
the lift and as you approach the guards put
their hands out Im sorry who are you
 Lodgings Well youll have to take the
path upward This is designated for guests of
Hupperdook
 Guests of whom
 Make a deception check
 Im sorry I dont recognize the name
Youll have to take the path
 I guarantee you sir Ive never heard the
name before in my life But there is always the path
 Of course He takes a small pistol out
from his side and aims it in the air and it fires
with a puff of smoke and the chains begin to
lift
 As you guys are frustratingly fuming over
that notquiteaspositive experience a voice
from around behind you goes Well now You look
like youre not from around here Is that true
You turn and glance behind you and you can see
through a surly grin and a curly mop of
brownishred hair a female gnome in her young
adult years wearing simple clothes some leather
gloves She has dangling around her neck a set of
eye protectors Shes rubbing a little bit of soot
from her chin So You couldnt take the lift
 Are you
 See thats going to get you far here
Honesty
 Well probably both depending on the time
of day So who are you if I might ask
 So youre not from around here I like
that What brings you to Hupperdook
 Her brow furrows and a smile curls even
wider across her face Youre not wrong Youre
not wrong Well I happen to be a local looking
for a way to kick off some boredom Mind me
showing you around
 My name Rissa Pleasure to meet you
Mr
 Fjord Mayhaps we be getting in some
trouble too
 We got about two hours
 Well at this time itll probably be about
dusk
 Theres a few inns to pick from I can take
you around Here Ill lead you up the walkway
Follow me
 You guys begin to make your way up the
switchback path up the mountainside towards the
upper edge of the shelf Along that way your new
friend Rissa jumps up into the cart with you
She says I get the sense you dont know much
about us here
 Oh no charge Or buy me a round or five
and well call it even
 Okay Thats all I ask Maybe help me fuck
with a friend or two
 She looks to Beau and is like Yeah
 Anyway dont worry I know the place is a
bit droll but once the suns down it gets
interesting
 Anyway things are a bit busy around here
Theyre busy most of the time General workday
here is about ten to  hours No weekends no
breaks like the rest of you lazy and lackadaisical folk
 Fair enough Give you a quick tour of the
place should give us right about time to get some drinks
 As you make your way up the mountain making
small chatter eventually you come to the
outskirts of the Idleworks Shelf Here
encompassing the outer ring of this elevated shelf
of the Silberquel Ridge is a lively district of
taverns inns merchants open pavilions that are
currently empty It looks like the place is pretty
much perpetually decorated for some sort of an
event or a festival but its in disuse at the
moment It is empty Everyone you see in the
street theres nobody taking a walk Everyone is
rushing from one place to another or shouting
commands Theres a general air of busyness and
intent in each person you see As you guys
leisurely stroll through every now and then you
get this sideeye of and they continue on past
A majority of the people here are gnomish
Probably  percent of the people you see in the
immediate vicinity at any point in time are of
gnomish heritage only offset by the occasional
dwarf and some human halfelf Thats as much as
youve seen in your path here so far
 I mean you do as you do You are a very
colorful ensemble whenever you enter any sort of
new establishment
 Not yet no but to be fair most of the
streets are empty unless its people going from
business to business Its an interesting feel
Its almost like the town is a ghost town where
its dead outside of those that are in the process
of making errands or doing runs
 A little bit but not as bad as below At
this point your friend Rissa is pointing out in
different directions and goes All right then
thats over that way This is the center of
Hupperdook culture here on the Shelf where most
of the folks come to unwind Beyond that you can
see whats called the Silver Falls pointing over
there Thats the core of where most of the
residents live sleep make their families
amongst the small towers you can see And from
this point you can now see those strange
fingerlike protrusions that were guarded around
the waterfall are very condensed thin and tall
metallic towers that have balconies and little
windows
 Theyre three stories maybe four stories at
most A lot of them look like theyre offkilter
It looks not safe though they probably are Its
a very unique living situation you havent
encountered with any other people in the Empire
and beyond Glancing up you can see there
are a few folks that are out there in the process
of laying some rugs out and hanging them over the
side One woman up there is throwing some seeds to
some birds that float by and start eating off the
edge there
 Im sure there is Not anything Ive
bothered with though Not much of a reader My
father well he might know but you dont want to
talk to him
 Just wait Be patient Be patient
 I choose to live on a low floor
 Yeah Gets warmer up top anyway Dont
want that
 Youre telling me Want my quads to be
ready in case I need to go into a sprint Run for
my life You know
 I used to Occasionally
 I supervise
 Youre being a bit nosy here not going to
lie I know we just met and Im helping showing
you around but
 I offered to tell you about the city not
about myself
 I think youll fit in quite well around
here
 I havent found a vocation that fits my
personality Tried some things Wasnt my thing
 Well theres a few different places Are
you looking for a quiet spot to sleep or are you
looking for a wild place to not sleep
 Blushing Tankard it is
 At this point the oranges and reds of
sundown have taken the sky and you hear this pop sound
 You look up and you can see splashes of
light in the sky above you Faint fireworks start
going off
 You start hearing shouts Voices echoing
from the city from the towers from behind you
along the Shelf All these steam whistles start
going off down below echoing from below The
streets suddenly come to life as people begin to
rush out of buildings taking off their aprons
taking off their gloves setting off whatever
their work attire is and rushing off to home to
unwind There is a rush of energy and you begin
to realize Beau wasnt kidding
 They work hard and at night they play
hard
 And thats where were going to finish
tonights episode

 Oh Fourth Street I love Fourth Street
Well pick up this next week We may or may not
have Ashley depending on if Skype is available
 Nevertheless thank you guys so much
 Yeah Wils been offset trying to curse my
dice Apparently I deflected it to the party
Happy about that Thank you guys for joining us
tonight
 Anyway well see you guys next week Have a
wonderful weekend and the following week from
there We love you and is it Thursday yet Good
night

 Hello everyone and welcome back Thats
completed their first of two ventures they agreed
to complete in the name of The Gentleman Heading
northward towards Berleben traversing the
dangerous Labenda Swamp freeing the once
endangered safe house from the encroaching merrow
dangers that had destroyed and decimated the
people that were working there at the time and
freeing it up for future use You had acquired a
bird friend in the tiny Kiri that is along with
you dagger in hand
 Yeah Thats fine Youll be fine
 You gathered your things and went back to
the open road where you headed to the crossroads
did some trading Through the evening jumped into
a few old friends who were looking to rob you
sent them on their way Then continued northward
until eventually you came upon the outskirts of
the what was it Silberquel Ridge there we
go brain not working to the gnomish city of
Hupperdook Upon arriving in the city you took in
heavy machinery and the creation of new types of
clockworkbased technologies the stacks of soot
and steam sent outward the war machines being
developed for use to the eastern lines where the
conflict with Xhorhas is now brewing You made a
friend by the name of Rissa who said in exchange
for a round drinks in the evening would show you
around the town for a bit Upon making your way to
the upper level you were given a brief tour of
the vicinity which seemed strangely empty The
streets very well decorated for some seeming
celebration but nobody present As the sun slowly
went down the town came to life as all the work
whistles blew the sounds of merriment began And
suddenly as the sun goes vanishing behind the
distant mountains the golds and oranges and
subtle purples of the sunset begin to take over
the sound of music and laughter begins to take the
streets So Mighty Nein what would you like to
do
 Right yeah
 Like I said welcome to Hupperdook
 Well I mean what else is there to do for
the night here but that
 Theres nothing else to do Youve arrived
go and get your stuff somewhere and lets have a drink
 You owe me a round anyway
 Yeah Its part of our culture our gnomish
heritage
 Why Because it keeps us working hard every
day Sure maybe our general longevity for
gnomes is a little shorter than most but what a
life we lead She reaches out and shes leaning
out the cart as you guys are heading through the
street These kids run by with sparklers in their
hands and she reaches out and plucks them from
their hand and picks it up its all 
around and she passes it over
 I can already see Im going to like you
folks
 Thats the way we do here
 You can
 Well in the tavern
 Oh you can lock the doors
 Because you put your lips to it
 Make a perception check
 Candy necklaces big giant pacifiers
 What you see is waves of fast moving
families and people Gnomish some dwarves a few
humansized folks rushing by It looks like some
of them are rushing from work to get home to
disrobe from all their dirty clothes and jump back
out with their party attire or theyre already on
their way to wherever their destination is You
hear fireworks going off in the distance and the
occasional flashes in the sky But you dont see
any vendors at this juncture At this point whos
helming the cart and the horses
 Okay Rissa saddles up sits right in the
little bench next to you at the front of the cart
and takes part of the reins Helping to guide you
to where youre trying to get to go Follow me
Tug to the right and its got about two blocks
down that way Its going to be hard to miss Look
for the large arch with the various spiraling ivy
vines against it
 Yeah make a perception check
 During this travel as youre keeping an eye
out she seems to be just focused on the task at hand
 Thats what it could mean or she could just
not be trying to steal from you but it could be
either You dont know After pulling around the
side you come to this large celebration square
where there are three stages set up There is a
large maypole in the center and theyre currently
lifting up and tethering these large colorful
streamers of multiple colors People are gathering
baskets of flowers A few get tossed and you catch
it and theyre made of cloth You get the sense
here that they dont have access to a lot of fresh
flowers here in Hupperdook based on the rocky
terrain and the perpetual tossing of soot and ash
into the atmosphere Also if the celebration is
that often they probably continue to reuse the
same elements over and over again As you come
over into this corner there are bands starting to
play music being set up on the outside people
are starting to sit down with blankets and
families are starting to gather in this area To
your left you see the large ivory archway with
the ivy thats twisting across the top of it
Rissa reaches and tugs your hands to the left to
gear the cart in that direction and goes All
right Blushing Tankard right up this way
Theres more laughter and there are two vendors
now on the outside one of which is currently
selling flower necklaces or bands The other has
clusters of sparklers and firecrackers
 You walk up and theres a young gnomish man
in what would be the equivalent of his late teens
or early twenties got a very prominent Adams
apple and very thin for some of the gnomes youve
seen around there He glances up to you holding a
small barrel filled with various smallscale
explosives Hi can I help you
 Three all right Ill just get this
together
 Well do you want three of everything or do
you want a pack
 Packs of ten
 Packs for both of ten
 All right pack of each That will be five
silver
 Oh thats on the other side the next
person over there a portlylooking fellow in his
middle ages or so resting inside of his neck
rescinded inside Hi yeah the flowers are going
to run about five copper per string So do you
want just one
 Hes got a bunch of them tied up in his
hair and hanging off his neck
 Braids are across the way over there Cindy
does the braids
 All right thats five copper thank you
 Youre going to keep collecting pathetic
characters to fight with you
 Its the best front line you can hope for
 
 You go back and look at it and you realize
there is actually a tiny little fuse on it
 Roll for an attack
 You dont even have to roll damage She
tosses it in the air and it arcs this tiny little
firecracker this little gray rod and then this
little streak of flame fires up and hits it It
detonates with this loud pop sound and you see
sparks around it It dissipates a moment after and
in the vicinity about seven or eight nearby
gnomes two of which children all go 
Yeah Start clapping and cheering
 Ten so you have nine now
 Well communally not much at all You make
an intelligence check and have advantage because
of your alchemical history
 Yes
 You know its had minor applications for a
while but its only really been applied in very
condensed and common use for like the explosives
you found in the mine clearing out spaces in
underground caverns or for the detonation of
localized rocks that are in the way of paths
trying to be put in mountain ranges Small scale
black powder like this you havent encountered
really so this seems to be a relatively new use
of this particular compound
 Youve barely come across it at all Youve
read about it Actually the dynamite sticks you
found in the mine were probably the first ones you
encountered in your experience Not a lot of use
for it in the small farming town of Felderwin
 You have before but theyre saved for very
rare occasions like the coming of a ship thats
been long gone from shore or particular times of
the year for celebrations they would go off and
for that in particular they would put ship barges
out on the water and they would fire them up from
the waterfront Having it this close is intense
and even that small burst right there there was a
flash of heat that you havent really had before
and its really exciting
 Most everyone you see here is gnomish
Youve seen a handful of dwarves thats the next
prominent people that live here and then a
smattering of human and halfelf Right now you
guys have just come to the outside of The Blushing
Tankard
 There is
 Okay
 You guys leaving Caleb and youre staying
with Caleb while he sets up the perimeter
 As you guys enter the Blushing Tankard
Tavern it is one of the larger taverns youve
been in The floor space has  or so round tables
scattered amongst the floor There is a stage in
the far back where the music hasnt quite started
yet but there are musicians setting up You can
see a violinist whos currently tuning There is a
piano in the back and outside a couple of taverns
you saw in Zadash and your experiences from when
you were on the coast pianos arent as common in
tavern spaces Usually reserved for the upper
class for private performances or higherend
social events However the tables are filling up
already people are rushing in there Food is
passed around left and right In the back theres
a group of gnomes that are currently clapping the
ground on their table singing some sort of tune
a shanty One of them is up on the table clapping
his legs there One of the barmaids comes by and
slaps him Get off the table
 What would you guys like to do
 All right
 Okay go ahead and make a performance
check
 Theres a few moments of this going on
before you suddenly hear this 
You turn over your left shoulder and
there is a halfelven gentlemen in a very nice
doublet who is currently holding a handful of
sheet music Um youre at my piano
 He twitches at the offtune hammering of the
keys Ill be right back He turns around and
wanders off for the moment clearing his ear with
his pinky You guys go to get rooms
 You head to the front its a very long bar
that wraps around the right side of the entire
chamber It has two hatches that can open up From
the inside you see two individuals You see a
male gnome with a massive mane of red hair Clean
shaven middle age and hes smiling and running
around getting drinks sliding them down the bar
filling things Hes the gnomish redhead
equivalent of Tom Cruise Spinning the bottles and
pouring them out On the other side you see a
female dwarf with this awesome wellkept
chinstrap beard who has beautiful eye makeup on
and this very colorful silk billowing blouse
that tapers at the wrist with a flourish Shes
currently filling out drink and snack orders and
theyre both workhorses They both have smiles on
their faces and theyre chatting with regulars
You havent quite caught their eye yet theyre in
the midst of other business
 A dwarf yeah
 For the hell of it both of you guys roll
charisma checks please
 Just roll a d and add your charisma
modifier
 So the better part of  minutes pass of you
guys waiting there and being overlooked until
eventually the dwarf woman stops and goes All
right sorry about that didnt see you there
Youre a bit higher than the usual folk What can
I do for you
 Both of those can be done lassie
 Four rooms all right Lets see then
Thats one gold piece per room per night
 This is the mini bar my dear But dont
worry We can bring drinks up we can bring
companions up we can bring what you need up just
let us know
 All right
 But really fast
 Its impressive A little offkey but
overall impressive the speed of the composition
Right as she starts crescendoing about to get to
the quiet part 
a hand slams down on the keys and that same
halfelven gentlemen leans in once more and goes
If I might please request my instrument returned
to me my dear
 Thank you
 I am
 I have a tipping hat He pulls off from
the side this widebrimmed hat that comes to a
point in the front and floppy in the back and he
sets it up on top of the piano
 Well then I certainly hope the first few
tips come while youre at the bench
 And he sits down at the bench and pushes you
off of it
 I saw Cracks his knuckles sets his music
down in front starts getting ready The other
performers to the side are watching this out of
the corner of their eye and laughing Theyre
enjoying the tension thats brewing
 You guys get your rooms situated As the
keys are being passed out to the different rooms
drinks are being handled So are you looking for
something strong or something strong
 She leans into you and goes I like you
Youre colorful
 Thank you First ones on me how about
that
 Hold that till later on That events not
till later tonight
 Is this your first time here
 A bit Well we have some performances
going on and then we have our contest Our weekly
Hour of Honor So just dont drink too much if
youre looking to compete She pops the top
button off the top of her blouse and gives a
better look at her dwarven cleavage
 I realized that I could do it as I was doing
it As she does that she reaches down and pulls
out a dark red glass bottle with a large cap
which she pulls off This tiny glass passes it
over to you and you look at it Youre used to
seeing liquid splash quite often this sloshes at
a slower pace Its a thicker liquor
 Its surprisingly sweet Strong the burn
kicks in afterward You like it
 Thats up to you
 Would you like one of the same
 All right thatll be five silver pieces
 Oh my goodness thank you She puts it in
her cleavage Pours you another shot of it as
well hands it over
 All right it burns but its good Its
like a sweet thick honey liquor that coats the
throat and the coating at first feels nice until
the burn hits
 Its good
 Yasha is with you but the players in
Japan filming As you glance around Yashas
sitting towards the back and towering over most
of the clientele here and not necessarily
uncomfortable but unsure what to make of the
jovial atmosphere There is the faint corner of a
smile but the awkward anxious smile of not
knowing what to do and afraid to step any
direction and crush somebody
 At this point Rissas like Well if
youve got your rooms taken care of were looking
for a place to sit then She glances past and
you can see patrons are starting to get really
rowdy They have these ropehung chandeliers in
three different spots and you can see one person
is jumped up onto one and is hanging back and
forth off of it Some people are like Yeah All
of a sudden the dwarf woman at the bar goes Oh
for the love of clambers over with a speed you
didnt expect from her rushes over and grabs the
ankle and tears him down off onto the ground
Not in my bar
 Are you talking to Rissa I imagine if
theyre not paying attention
 My gnomish eyes spot what looks to be one
open table across the way right there Rissa
points and you can see past the way theres one
table that two people are just getting up from and leaving
 You and Rissa go into a full run You
beating her easily You get to the table and scoot
into the side As she approaches you watch as two
male gnomes intercept her and block her path One
of them goes Uhuh sorry Tinkertop tables not
for you She goes Fuck off Fitz Ive worked
hard enough I saw this table fair and square
The other one goes You dont work Tabletop
just like your brainsick dad This tables for
working folk Fitz glances over and says Go ask
your pops to make you a table to drink at alone
Might buy you an hour before it breaks
 They both look wildly confused No no
 Make an intimidation check
 As you lean forward in that tense glare a
little bit of a liquorbased burp comes up
abruptly and breaks the intensity of the moment
Oh someones starting early not too bad No
from what Ive heard about these folks their
bloods fire but on the inside theyre nothing
but cold and clammy He goes and flicks the edge
of your nose these two little gnomish punks
 All right which one
 The one that just flicked you in the nose
his eyes go black and you can see the bit of
crimson pooling at the corner of the eyes He
goes  stumbles back and hits the
stool and falls onto his ass Whats going
on
 Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check
 You manage to pull six silver pieces and
three gold pieces out of his pocket
 Right now no Strangely enough its only
money and only that amount
 The one that gets slapped in the ass by
Jester is like  I apologize Rissa
we didnt know reaches over and goes and grabs
the friend As soon as Nott jumps on and starts
thrashing around on him Get that thing goes
and pushes you off of its body picks up the other
gnome At this point his eyes come back and the
little strings of blood are curling down the side
of his cheek He goes What happened
 They both just get lost into the crowd
 Rissa looks over her shoulder at them leave
and 
 Me too indeed
 Fitz and Ashton Theyre both a couple of
punks Ive known them since I was a kid
 Well Tinkertop
 Eh
 She curls into the bench around the table
and leans one shoulder onto it My fathers an
inventor a tinkerer of some renown at one time
Hes had a rough few years
 Thats just him being an arsehole
 All sorts of things toys contraptions
occasionally whatever hes told to make by the
Starosta but hes just a bumbling twat really
 Hes probably in nap time right now
Tomorrow maybe
 Another round of just traditional ale drinks
for everybody would probably run you well say
three silver pieces As you guys gather around for
a second Rissa livens up a bit after that
conversation But anyway youve asked me a bit
about myself what about you What are you here
for What brings you to this godforsaken place
 Looking for work
 Thats not the first time weve heard
that
 Im just going to call that unintentional
ignorance but no gnomes dont live in
mushrooms Dont be saying that around here very
loudly not all folks will be taking kindly to that
 She grabs one of the tankards and starts
drinking heavily from it Anyway The music
begins to kick in even louder The celebration has
kicked into a second gear here once I can find
the music transition
 The crowd begins to hush for a moment From
one of the back rooms a door opens and a range of
brightlycolored gnome dancers come rushing into
the room to a swell of cheers and applause You
see four dancers emerge across the spectrum of
gender and take to tabletops and begin to stomp
and click their feet to the rhythm of the music
The musicians begin to finally pick up and build
The pianist you met earlier is starting to make
his music happen Its beautiful and echoes
through the room the placement of it You get the
sense now whether it be some enchantment or some
intentional acoustic presence in the room but the
music carries well and seems to bleed from
everywhere As the dancers are up on the tables
these silk scarves rainbowcolored from their
arms twirl into large circles and shapes and
they have this worked out fantastic choreography
in unison They begin to leap from tabletop to
tabletop in a circular fashion making these large
arching foot leaps and landing again Folks cheer
with each land the music whirring itself into a
frenzy Folks are starting to toss coins towards
them on the table They in the middle of it will
spin catch one and pocket it and move back into
the dance You get the sense this a very practiced
and fairly often performed as to how welloiled
this machine of a performance is
 Snatched out of the air
 Make a dexterity check This is going to be
a contested dexterity check between you and a dancer
 As you reach for the coin your fingers
almost touch it before everything goes dark as a
wooden shoecovered foot  across your
face from the dancer who catches it between two
fingers looks down retracts the foot and as you
get your vision back and look up the dancer gives
you a wink and goes back into a spin
 As the dancers begin to gather leaping from
table to table they start getting closer to the
center of the room They begin to spin together
until eventually they clasp hands Some of the bar
hands grab the tables and start pushing them
together in the center telling the patrons to
step back a bit As they do the circle continues
to get tighter as they leap from table to table
holding each other wrist to wrist arm to arm As
they do the silks are billowing out and you can
see them extending The silks theyve been holding
seem to have been a bunch hidden within their
sleeves As they billow out they widen until
its like a parachute of rainbow colors that just
spin in this circle It completely engulfs them
all you see is the tip of their heads within this
swirl of color until eventually the music comes to
a climax and with a heavy stomp all the colors
fade and the dancers bow Everyone in the room
starts cheering and clapping

 The dancers smile and step off walking
around with hats in the front taking tips from
people at tables as they adjust the tables back to
their original point Everyone else goes back to
their meals and you see them tossing the odd
copper or silver piece into their hats
 Kiri is off to the side 
 For the most part yeah As the evening
goes on it tends to gather around the places where
drink is running freely until everyone passes
out then wakes up hair of the dog usually takes
himself a bit of Fuse and then gets back to
work
 A Fuse is the hair of the dog drink that we
brew here to get everyone waking up and back to work
 I dont know how its going to mingle well
with nongnomish tracts but Im willing to watch and try
 Me too 
 Hour of Honor
 Look over there She points to the far
wall and theyre starting to set up lights on it
these glowing lanterns they have on pikes Its a
collection of wooden name plates She goes Once
a week theres a contest where the previous
holders of the Hour of Honor can take challenges
Whoever provides the most monetary amount to the
challenge gets to go oneonone with their team
drink to drink until only ones left unpuking or
unpassed out
 The remainder gets the coin I think a
percentage goes to the house and gets to take the
title and a token That token is worth a free
drink to each member of that team in this bar
every night
 From what Ive seen it can depend on if
people are that interested or that competitive
Some folks put up the few gold theyve earned for
a few days if theyre feeling lucky Ive seen
people put upwards of   gold sometimes which
is quite a sizable sum
 I can hold my weight but Im not much of a
competitor if thats what youre asking
 Youve probably been here for the better
part of an hour or two just getting your paces
having drinks and taking in the performances and
the music Id say you probably have another hour
before it begins
  I am Kiri
  Yes I am very sweet
  Doesnt matter though
  Okay
  I know her
 Rissa at this point goes Well
first off youre assuming theyre all women
 I can honestly say I do not Sorry
 As you approach the bar the dwarven woman
whos in the process of cleaning a spill on the
side looks over and sees you and does a
tripletake like Well would you look at this
strapping mass of green and tooth 
 What can I do for you
 Mighty forward but I cant say Im not
interested Ive got a few more hours on my shift
but if you hang around
 Well its been a while since Ive
 She goes and starts pouring herself a
drink
 How many
 Three companions All right I have to go
and connect with a friend here and see whats
available but thats certainly doable
 Well that depends on what youre asking
for Is it only for the hour is it for the
evening what the requests are
 For an hour Three Thatd put you about
say  gold
 I can do that yeah Shes small I can
hold her down
 Its awkward for me too
 Good then you go out and have a good time
Ill hold the bird down
  I can send a message
  Okay I dont know if its
smart
 
 She holds her little dagger in front of
her
  Okay
 Hes not going to leave his friends behind
 As youre making your way out the dwarven
lass reaches out in your direction Fjord to flag you down
 So just asking
 how soon are you wanting
this companionship sent to your rooms and and
her fingers playing with the front of your armor
on the edge of the bar and goes I could give
you a discount
 Would you like me to cancel your request
then
 All right Ill hold on to this until then
Well hopefully see you around Gives a hint of
grinning stinkeye in your direction Jester and
 At this point Kiri whos not that far from
you because youre still in the bar says like
Jester Dont eat humans okay Yasha goes Im
going to take her upstairs and heads off to the chamber
 Theres a big bassy  that you can
feel in your chest Theres a flash of color
outside and there out maybe  feet looking up
Molly Theres a flash of the firework in the sky
going across his horns and form
 You walk out in this fair Most people who
have gathered here theyre sitting there theyre
eating food and theyre watching the fireworks as
they go off Theres a few folks out there candle
dancers they have these light candles and its
this very slow meticulous dance Theyre moving
in the darkest places of the corner and give this
almost willowisptype performance Its really
enchanting and borderline creepy at times when
you cant actually make out the forms of the
dancer in the shadow People are watching and
keeping an intent look on it Otherwise the rest
of this thoroughfare is apparently here though
youre not sure how much businesses are open
since most people are in the process of recovering
from a day of business What do you want to do
 What else are you guys going to do
 Oh yeah There arent a lot of them
meaning theres not an endless supply but you go
back to the same people that are just up the road
to the right from the outside of the tavern You
can find the same two vendors you spoke with
earlier
 Make an investigation check and you make a
perception check Caleb
 Was it a natural one
 Oh so not quite a natural one You come
upon a number of vendors that have already given
out all their flowers so youre having a hard
time finding anybody that still have any for sale
in this main central area
 Well come to that in a little bit
 Okay good to keep that in mind as we move
on
 You go back to those two vendors Theyre
both set up on the side The one guy with the
sparklers is still set up there and the guy with
the fireworks is still resting there on the edge
and the other guy with the flowers is set up on
the side Theres one guy with the sparklers and
the fireworks whos there the thin somewhat
dopeylooking young gnomish guy and you have the
flower vendor whos slowly settled into himself
like a barrel of a gnome
 Hey Welcome back
 I dont really have anything more powerful
than these
 Hes at this point locking eyes with you
Nott and theres like a look of recognition in his face
 I dont have anything of that variety Im
sorry
 Sorry were closing shop up for the
night
 Then he goes and closes up his little
satchel and walks away
 At this point you guys are caught up with
the rest of the crowd as you guys have meandered
your way and look up and you can see the rest of
your party has been wandering the street
 Its pretty damn good wine
 At this moment Caleb in listening to this
conversation your eyes focus on a sign post
behind her on a building that reads Bent Binders
 No The windows are closed
 Make a perception check
 As you look through the combination of the
two of you eventually the glass fogs up and you
cant see anything But from the brief moment you
had on the inside it looks like there are a few
shelves that contains some books It looks like
there is actually a binding press and tools for
bookbinding in there
 It looks like they have books for sale but
its too dark for you to see if they are blank or
if they are actual books at the moment
 You cannot tell yet no Just like
Christmas you must wait til the morning

 Make an investigation check
 Actually as you guys are fogging up the
window you pull back and look to the left and
you can see this adorable little gnome girl with
deep tan skin her hair pulled in these cute
little puffy buns in the side of her head and she
has this little basket that is just filled with
these differentcolored silkmaterial flowers
Shes standing there smiling and you can see an
older gnome sitting in a rocking chair behind her
with a big old pipe coming out of his mouth as the
hat is halfcovering his face and hes just
sitting there rocking next to her
 Really
 Hi
 Oh my goodness Thank you so much Okay
 Dad how much is a flower The guy sitting
there rocking goes Take them a silver apiece
Sorry copper
 Yeah
 Copper
 You will get ten flowers from me
Licketysplit She goes and takes out a handful
counts them in your hand One two
 three I am five
 Yes Hes a good dad
 What number is that
 What
 Oh Im very special too
 Yeah
 The house is two buildings down that way
and back one street You could see it has the red
brick on the base by the door
 Okay Whats your name
 Tara
 Nice to meet you too
 Theres this pause and she goes Okay
Bye
 Then runs back and goes Dad dad dad
and starts taking the copper and puts it in his
hand and hes like Oh thats a fine job He
pulls his hat up a bit and takes the coin He
looks over to you as you walk away and
 Make an insight check
 Seems like a nice enough dad Yeah
 Anything else you guys wish to do Its
starting to get relatively close to that hour window
 There are crownsguard Its interesting
because there are half and half For the large
gnomish population here you see half of the
crownsguard are gnomish and many of them have
some form of firearm slung over their back and
shoulders The other half appear to be human or
halfelf The humanhalfelf crownsguard appear to
be less jovial and really paying attention to the
chaos and generally trying to keep an eye out for
anything untoward
 In comparison to the rest of the people that
are currently celebrating yes But even the
gnomish crownsguard seem to be taking their job
seriously but theyre still part of the event
 You get the sense here that everyone else
gets to celebrate and party at this hour and they
dont get to so they cheat a little bit
Honestly theres more crownsguard at night than
you expected When you came into the city it
didnt seem that heavily guarded but now theyre
out in a pretty serious force You gather probably
a combination of there being wartime or because
the nature of what this city builds As youre
glancing out on the outside of the ledge of this
upper area looking down there are a number of
torches out by where the construction yards are
down below Either people are working through the
night down there or theres a fairly heavy
presence of crownsguard present around these
partiallyconstructed devices and machines of war
that you saw being worked on earlier in the day
 The gentleman whos selling the flower bands
is sitting already smiling and goes
 Yeah it has a few uses on it per day You
guys return to the Blushing Tankard Tavern The
musics still blaring Drinks are being thrown
around A bunch of people are singing big old
songs and clanking their tankards together and
spilling onto the tabletops The floor is already
slick with spilled liquor here and there It is a
party that hasnt stopped since you left As you
guys begin to enter the dwarven woman who you had
spoken with earlier gets onto one of the central
tables and slams her foot on the table Everyone
starts looking over and she goes Attention
arseholes Might I have your leering eyes upon
this supple and available specimen of a woman
You hear some whistles Oh thank you She bends
forward with a wink to the crowd Its as youve
Cheers clapping The tokens and titles are at
stake Ol Blemmy and his crew hold this winners
tokens for the last three weeks and she gestures
over and you can see a team there mostly of
gnomes Ol Blemmy is this dwarf with one giant
gash down his face and the snowblind eye in that
socket is sitting there with this tuft of a beard
that has been so unkempt that you cant see his
mouth Its this grayblack saltandpepper bush
that disappears into a chin beard You assume hes
grinning beneath there
 Kind of yeah Beard Papa
 Theyre not willing to let them go Who
wants to put up their coin and their balls to
topple these nobodies  Folks start
standing up and tossing some coin on the table at
her feet and shouting out Five silver A gold
piece Three gold over here People are
standing up and their groups are starting to get
amped up and ready Shes like Keep them coming
keep them coming
 Whoa By the colorful newcomers hi there
sweetie
 Do we have more than ten gold here to try
and take down these giants of drinking Theres a
moment and this one group in the corner these
coalsmeared gnomes that come from you can
assume now this is probably a heavy mining town
Theyre sitting there with elements of their
leather work clothes still on and theyre all
thinking and talking amongst themselves and they
all pull in a few more coins and one of them
comes forward still wearing leather gloves from
the day and pops down  gold
 
 He goes back talking to them Comes back
 gold pieces
 At that point everyone goes Whoa With a
flourish you place the rest of the  gold piece
pot on the table Ooh
 So Turns back and looks back at the
miners and they all go 
 They gather their gold off the table back
again and Irena goes Well if thats it it
looks like our contenders for the night are
 what are you called
 The Mighty Nein
 Cheers and clamoring continue around and
everyone starts shouting and yelling
All right lets set up these drinks people
With that final slam on the table she leaps off
onto the ground and starts heading off towards the
bar on the side The other bartender the gnomish
gentleman there is rapidly clearing out tankards
and drinks and hes starting to pull up bottles
onto the countertop They start pushing tables
into the center again once more as the crowds
begin to circle around and Ol Blemmy and the
rest of his rather roughlooking crew that have
seen some life in their time
 Theyre all pretty much gnomish middleage
which could be anywhere between  to  years
old and you can see the weathering on their faces
and their clothing They look like they nearly
drink professionally They step up to the table
and they figure out what order theyre going to go
in You guys figure out what order youre going to
go in
 Theres five on their team and talking to
her a bit she goes All right
theres five competitors You need to pick five of
your team to compete
 Whos sitting it out amongst you guys
 You need five yeah
 As youre coming down you notice Jester
the crowds are all gathering and theres this big
circle appearing around the central they have
two tables that are set up with a single bench
each end You can see a third table behind it
where theres probably going to be the dwarf woman
overseeing this venture You do see this little
gnome girl thats walking through the crowd and
her hands open and people are
 Its not Tara actually but its a rather
dirtylooking gnome little girl whos thumbing
through and getting pushed around a little bit
her hands are out in front
 She takes it and Thank you barely
audible voice and continues wandering in the
crowd So the five of you guys are doing it
 At this point the dwarf woman comes back to
the top of the tables there looks out All
right friends I am but your humble evening
mistress Irena Clommop And it is my pleasure to
present to you tonights esteemed headtohead
drinking battle between Ol Blemmy and crew and
The Mighty Nein First up of Blemmys crew we
have Duncan You see this one gnome gentleman
come forward Patchy beard more of a Stonewall
Jackson type missing the centerpiece there His
eyes are bloodshot and red His hairs slicked
back with some sort of a thick oil and hes
wearing a leather apron over a white stained
shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows
He sits up gets on one end of the table puts one
hand on his tankard and is waiting for his
competitor And on The Mighty Neins side whos
competing against old Duncan
 Whats your name
 Molly All right So well take turns She
grabs this small barrel its a handheld barrel
she pours both of your drinks to the brim When I
clap hands together you both drink Its not
first to finish but its one drink after the
next First to pass out or lose their drink
forfeits So with your drinks full lets begin
With that I need you to roll a constitution
check Roll a d add your constitution
modifier
 You watch as Duncan takes it 
 Youre drinking it and getting through it
fine Youre partway through your drink and hes
already finished  on the table It was a
natural  on his end
 You finish the drink and youre like
 a little effervescent but its there So
thats one loss on your end How the rules work is
that the first to three losses is the one in
these competitive spaces
 No that was just how fast he finished The
idea is you both make competitive constitution
checks and the first to three losses in that
competition is the one that either barfs or passes out
 Yeah essentially At that point as soon as
you guys drop the drinks Next round
Fills up both of them the crowd starts cheering
Go ahead and roll
 He rolled a two plus two so four
 This time around you manage to finish a
little sooner than him You put it down hes like
 Roll again Fills up for
the third round
 You finish your drink a little bit sooner
than him plop it down  From
behind him you hear Ol Blemmy go Dont you lose
it boy A voice that grates like its been
slammed across a hundred years of seawater
 Roll off again
 You finish your drink He takes his next
one pops it down and you both stare for a
moment  Down the front of
his shirt the crowds goes like No Tries to
scoop it back up and theyre like No and
youre out Irena kicks him out of the chair
And hes done First round goes to The Mighty
Nein
 He gets off the ground dazed You are
fucking drunk Molly
 He topples back to you guys you see Duncan
get pulled back in the crowd and Ol Blemmys
like  and under his breath
you can hear a string of curse words
Next up we have Ruth You watch as this rotund
toughlooking oval of a gnomish woman comes up
there her hair pulled into really tight braids in
the side with bright freckles and this grimace
This woman has seen some shit and lived She gets
up to the side takes the same tankard and goes
Ill show you how its done Duncan Fill it
 Make a persuasion check
 With that the crowd starts picking up on
Beau and the name Beau Beau Beau begins to
resonate through the crowd You lock eyes with
this gnomish woman and you can see there should be
color but the irises are gray slate gray and
it puts you off Theres this intensity to her
that youre like Oh This is
 Go ahead and roll
 No But people are definitely invested in
this victory Go ahead and make your first roll
 You both chug slam it down at the same
exact time Both hold tight It was a tie
 They fill up the drinks And next round
go Roll for it
 You both  you finish just before
slam the drinks down 
 Thats one victory on your end there Roll
again
 This time she doesnt even break eye
contact with you She tilts to the side fast
gulping finishes it in seconds and slams it down
 and burps in your direction
while youre still drinking and it catches you
Thats a loss on your end
 Yeah Next one
 Nice rolls These are not saving throws
right This is the actual check
 Got it On that as you both fill this next
set of tankards you drink and you finish just
before she does Both slam down and shes
starting to have to tough into it You can see her
grinding her fingers into the woodwork This is a
lot of drinking
 Thats two victories to you one victory to
her Fill up the next batch the crowds still
shouting Beau Beau Beau Next roll
 This time she toughs it in she grabs with
both hands and chugs it down The foam catches the
corner of her mouth and she finishes it and she
wipes it off and sips it off her finger
 Thats a victory on her end You guys are
both tied the next rolls going to see who takes it
 Beau Beau Beau Her left eyes twitching
as shes glaring at you
 She did
 With that you both chug maintaining eye
contact You get partway into it and then
 and you begin backing up
into the tankard You try and pass it off and
then as you drop the tankard to gather yourself
 it sprays onto the table
 Oh The whole crowd worked up for Beaus
victory falls into a series of sad awws Ruth
finishes her drink sets it on the table and
 turns around and goes back
 Next up we have Valkin You see now this
very young looks like the runt of his family
line of gnomes comes forward Looks very thin
brighteyed and very stark contrast to the rest
of them as he gets closer to the table and
sits down Whos my competitor
 Puts out a hand Caleb its a pleasure
 Best of luck May the best gnome win
 Yes
 As you guys gather the crowd begins to pull
in a bit The evening mistress leans down at you
and goes Dont worry lad I can see youre
nervous but just let the throat open and take it
in Leans back And first batch go Roll off
 Oh shit Unexpectedly so little Caleb finds
his taste for alcohol in this one and with but a
moments notice downs the entirety of his glass
finishing it before Valkin does Who says Oh
well done Thats impressive
 Fills both of them again Next round go for
it
 Your confidence overtakes you as you go into
the second round of cups and you manage to
finish but you have to stop halfway through You
have to actually go  for the
second serving You take it down and finish it
however as you pull your glass down you can see
Valkins there leaning
 I can tell that Well done well done
 Their drinks are filled Go for it
 Both of you guys make individual performance
checks
 He does not seem to be distracted
unfortunately What did you roll
 As you take a moment and grunting and
huffing
 You manage to finish the last bits of it
and it takes a moment You can feel all the suds
of the mixtures of drinks youve had tonight
billowing in your stomach and churning You hear
the  in your stomach Youre like oh
thats not good Thats a second loss on your end
 They fill it up Next roll
  With this you see Valkin he rolled a
nine plus three so you win this one He goes and
takes it finishes it You both within a second
of each other finish the drink and I got this
You got this I got this
 No dont Dont touch
 Ah no Dont do it please
 Fill up the last batch You guys both final
roll
 Natural  on his end With that he
finishes the drink and goes Told you Boo yah
Gets up from the table turns around and 
faceplants right in the ground Crowd goes Yeah
Caleb Pick him up
 You pull your way away from the table
Success is yours Thats now two victories on your
end One for Ruth there and two final competitors
Second to last competitor the powerhouse The
Walking Brick herself Tanya This dwarven woman
who looks like Rosie the Riveter on steroids
comes around the corner She has her sleeves
rolled up past the deltoids She has these massive
hands with a bit of the dwarven hair gathered on
the outside of the forearm Big square jaw
missing the two front teeth and she grins as she
sits down She has most of her hair up and tied
into this cloth She got a bit of the coal smears
on her cheeks
 Ah Evening to you
 Oh like all the time You
 Well good luck then Im happy to see how
long you last big boy Fill it up They fill the
drinks Take your first swig there
 You both finish neck and neck but you still
manage to get it down faster As you both stand
there she looks at you with a nod of being
impressed Not bad not bad
 Oh weve just gotten started
 Fill her up Fill the next round
 She beats you with a  As she goes ahead
and finishes off sets it down and just waits for
you to finish fingers crossed and goes Cute
cute Not as strong as coming out of the gate Is
that all you got You going to lose the wind in
your sails there green boy
 You hear this voice go Ah ey ey Hes
mine
 They fill up the two drinks
 Make a deception check
 Eight You manage to do so She doesnt seem
to be paying attention to you Caleb youre
getting really nauseous watching Jester do this
little dance off to the side
 Make your roll
 No shit Okay
 Thats two victories to you one victory to
her With that one you finish it abruptly slam
it down and youre like oh youre actually
gaining a round That weird swirling in your
stomach has faded and youve come into your own in
this game Shes looking you see the sweat
appearing on her brow Shes like Thats okay
Theres more where that came from Fill it up I
got his number come on Make a roll off
 What the shit
 And with that Tanya goes down She gets
halfway through the drink before No Sorry and
looks back towards Ol Blemmy before she leans
forward and stumbles out of the chair One of the
other people picks her up and pulls her to the
side and Ol Blemmys just sitting there fuming
 She goes And with that it looks like Ol
Blemmys team has fallen Thats three victories 
at which Ol Blemmy puts up a hand and goes
Not yet I havent competed One of theirs hasnt
double or nothing
 They look at each other going I think
thats a little rich for our tastes
 Whos going to come after me then
 Okay
 This This is what you bring before me as
an offering
 Im going to crush you little green one
 Its great When he talks you see the
bristles of the beard You can see as the evening
mistress up at the top goes All right Looks
like were going to get to see Ol Blemmy strain
through his baleen after all Get to the sides of
the table Let The Whale take a drink
 The dwarf sits down His mitt completely
encompasses the tankard with his giant dwarven
hand Against Ol Blemmy we have
 Otto
 And drink Pours the drinks make a roll
 Are you going to go with it
  You both chug down You manage to finish
quickly slam it down Oh this isnt as bad as
you thought Youve have much harder liquors than
this The froth is filling at the edges of his
mustache and as he pulls it down theres a
coating of foam from the drink resting there A
tongue comes out of nowhere this Cousin Itt
broomlike beard the tongue takes the suds in
That was a victory on your end
 Next batch Make the roll
  Thats pretty damn good Ol Blemmy
finishes his drink Thats two for two victories
on your end there Hes not had the best luck
rolling these last two rounds He finishes it
down Youre small but I can see why they call
you the Bottomless Pit
 He grabs the barrel from the person and
fills his own last tankard hands it off Lets
go Take the roll
 If you really want to sure
 So youre like Ah catching it
underneath The crowds like Yeah clamoring Go
ahead and make your roll
 As its coming down its splashing on your
face a bit Youre trying to catch it all
 You manage to catch most of it and you
finish it You realize that the liquors that
youve been having are not been mixing well with
this particular drink Youre starting to feel
oof Thats a victory on his end
 All you hear is this subtle 
Roll for the next one
 No but youre blessed
 All right make your roll
 He rolled a natural  with a plus four
modifier that puts him at 

Break the tank
 As you both finish the drink everyone is
like Yeah Oh The whole crowd backs up for a minute
 Ol Blemmy leans forward and goes Wait a
minute Are you a fucking green and passes out
on the table the saliva pools before him The
crowd goes wild

 Irena leans does and fiddles through his
pockets and pulls out his token He goes I do
believe that youve earned this
 Oh it get you free drinks here for the
rest of the week Or until someone takes it from you
 Yeah Cheers go up there Already theres
somebody off in the corner whos whittling a block
of wood and carving The Mighty Nein into it to
put on the wall The rest of Ol Blemmys team
begrudgingly come up and drunkenly pass forward
their tokens and pass them over to you You have
five drink tokens Five of you can drink for free
at this bar
 It was double or nothing so thats  gold
They end up having to pony up the rest of it
Theres a  cut for the house though so thats
 gold losing  of that
 Thats  gold go back to you guys
 Okay Everyone claps you on the back and
starts cheering and shaking your hands and stuff
Oh that was amazing
 We will in the morning
 Well if youre looking for a meal 
 I have a friend whos an herbalist who has
something could help with that
 Oh Its up third floor Theres a bit of
a water closet Just aim for the hole please
 You guys are trashed
 Id say you take a hit point
 Nott you are intoxicated You are
fearless
 In the midst of everything dying down
people are starting to get pretty sloshed and the
energy level while still rather rowdy some folks
are starting to tap out for the night Jester
drags Caleb into the center of the tavern floor
takes hands and Caleb almost running out on
autopilot who does have some minor experience in
the past Go ahead and make a performance check
with disadvantage Caleb
 Disadvantage because youre drunk
 Caleb a moment passes before Jester begins
leading you but you guys continue the two of
you to have a very nice little waltz in the
middle of the area Quietly the music begins to
change What was once the rowdy bar music
transitions into an actual waltz piece as the
musicians notice this happening The three fourths
begins to pick up One two three one two three
As you guys continue to dance a few other couples
begin to get up and start faking it They dont
seem to know but theyre watching playfully
making up their own waltztype maneuver An
impromptu halfassed waltz begins to develop here
in the center of the tavern
 You guys begin to join this as well Which
one of you is leading
 Mollys leading Notts at his beck and call
as you guys begin to dance around in a circle
Beau and Fjord youre drunkenly staring at this
 Oh thats right Youre still upstairs
Fjord is passed the fuck out upstairs
 Jester goes and tucks Caleb into one of the
rooms in bed comfortably
 Are you going to amplify it or not
 Make a constitution saving throw Beau
 Yes
 You manage to sober her up a little bit but
youre still pretty tipsy From going blackout
drunk youre now heavily buzzed and right at
drunk
 Whats interesting is as you finish this
out of some of the pores the actual alcohol is
drawn out hovers in the air for a second before
dropping on the ground
 Oh no
 No Not like that
 Do you leave Fjord in the bathroom
 Okay You guys all make yourselves back to
your rooms As you check inside Yasha is asleep
in a corner there with her sword at the side
ready Curled up against her chest is Kiri also
asleep bundled up a little bustle of feathers
 You guys eventually find yourselves to rest
for the night sleep Long arduous morning comes
to as the sun comes up through the windows The
sound of distant wandering roosters crowing at
daybreak break you into consciousness The
hangovers are real Beaus doing okay Theres a
little bit of a hangover but not too bad
Jesters totally sober Yashas sober
 Jester as you and Beau start to get ready
you guys start gathering your things Beau your
coin purse is missing

 You still have your money on you
 Make an investigation check
 You spend a few moments looking around and
its nowhere to be seen in the room
 All right is everybody else waking up
 No
 Nott Molly Fjord your coin purses are
gone and were going to take a break
 Your books are still with you
 Your diamond you keep with your components
That wasnt missing It was just the coin purse missing
 Hold it

 I love that woman All right guys well be
back here in a few minutes Stay tuned for the
break We have Jason Charles Millers video about
his awesome album Check it out and well see you
here in a few minutes

 And welcome back Returning to where we
were The Mighty Nein coming to consciousness
most of them with a roaring hangover have come to
realize that all of their money has been pilfered
Other than Jester and Yasha everyone else appears
to at some point during the evening lost their
monetary gains As you guys are finding this out
what do you do
 Kiri is with Yasha
   Go fuck
yourself
 To your memory they didnt Shortly after
the competition tucking their tails they went to
find another place to drink and not have to be in
the eyes of people that watched them lose
 You guys head down to the bottom floor of
the tavern and it is empty From seeing it so
busy the night before it is just odd empty
tables There is Irena at the bar whos
currently sitting down in the process eating a
sandwich probably looking a little hungover
herself Sitting at a far table in the middle of
cleaning out her fingernails is Rissa
 You walk up Good morning Youre all
looking appropriately fucked
 What can I get for you
 Breakfast can be done let me grab that
Sid Sid more breakfast
 No why Did someone take all your money
last night
 If youre not paying attention and you have
a lot on you well thats your own fault
 I dont know anyone particularly but it
happens sometimes Thats why most folks that go
out only take a few coins with them
 If youre walking around with a bank in
your pocket I mean youre asking for it
 You turn around and the cart is protected
There are crownsguard that patrol the main area
Its not as busy as it was last night of course
It seems they come out in full force A lot of
them seem to sleep during the day and then come
out at night to keep watch because thats when a
lot of things happen but there are a few Theres
one thats posted on the far corner It looks like
nobodys messed with the cart because it is out in
the open
 Are you referring to
 Okay so youve exited the tavern
 The food is being brought out to you slowly
over the next  minutes or so The crownsguard
looks to you Hes human a bushy not really
wellkept blond beard
 Morning
 You all right there buddy
 I can see youre newcomers to the town
then
 You dont say
 To conspicuous folks Maybe It happens
every now and then we try and keep an eye out
there As with any place of business there is
always going to be some element of theft Nothing
we saw out of the ordinary but we can begin to
investigate if you like
 You are profusely I cant say theres a
specific region If anything the workplaces here
are not teeming with that element The industrious
nature of the city keeps itself busy in a very
visible place Perhaps somewhat here in the
Idleworks Shelf theres the residential areas of
Silver Falls Those are probably the more likely
areas I wouldnt look in the lower half Up here
in this shelf and beyond would probably be the
most Are you sure I dont mind I could
probably keep an eye out Is there any information
you have about these individuals who robbed you may be
 Yeah I think you should go do that
 You too He sits back into his post
looking a bit confused
 I dont know what youre talking about
Which little girl
 Oh yeah the beggar She comes in every now
and then Some folks help her get along
 Not that Ive seen Shes like a waif
Whatre you talking about Make an insight check
 I mean as best as you can read she seems to
be forthright As best as you can read
 Okay So whats the saving throw on that
Whats the DC
 No she fails She goes like Whats going
on
 Because if I recall yeah she is aware of
the spell Shes like What sort of trickery are
you doing here I dont like this Ill ask you to
leave
 There are many shady figures that come
through here Its a town
 There was a lot of people here last night
I know youre asking me Look Im a
shadylooking character sometimes as well I cant
pick it Theres a lot of hardworking people here
 I did not steal your money
 No I dont know who stole your money
 I dont know You damn well pissed off Ol
Blemmy Hes a possible one Otherwise I dont
know if anyone got too friendly with you last
night I mean youve got to get close to take your money
 I didnt send any people up to your rooms
because you told me not to pay for I was holding
your cash which Ive still got by the way And
the offer still stands But
 I dont know probably
 Rissa comes up I can help you
 Not personally Im sure there are folks
out there
 She rubs her temples and you can tell she is
a little hungover herself too Shes like No
 I saw them come in at one point but then
leave when they noticed I was still hanging with
you folks so thank you for that I appreciate
that
 If all the rest of you are in the area
 If anybody else steps into that zone you
have to make a saving throw
 Make a saving throw
 Charisma right
 Yeah you resist it
 Rissa goes I mean its possible I
imagine People are distracted Theyre working
hard Theyre having to push out double time in a
lot of their work to get things out to the front
lines Its possible
 They are but theyre wooden and a little
bit bigger than an actual gold coin
 Yes What you asking
 No its just me and Syd At this point
Syd brings out the last of the food the male
gnome who you saw when you first entered Hes
like So all of your food is ready Enjoy
 Through a friend of mine
 Why are you asking me all these
questions I didnt send anyone up to your room
and Im not going to spill all of my business
propositions your direction
 Not really lass
 No
 She nods and takes another sip of her
morning coffee and goes Aye theyre about two
blocks down from my fathers shack A couple of
kids that although at this hour theyre probably
working at the anvil
 I dont know I havent hocked stolen goods
around here Im sorry
 To which one You have both Rissa
 What of the band
 Here He has a room on the third floor
 He was Weimar
 Shes like Oh all right Fair warning
pardon me rough morning
 So where are you wanting are you looking
for the boys The Steelbringers Forge first or
going to my pops place
 Okay follow me She gets up and finishes
her coffee sets it back down and you guys take
whatever scraps remain of your breakfast and make
your way back out into the street
 Both Im a businesswoman but Ive got my
needs
 Okay so you cast it Youre in the tavern
Youre not getting anything
 In the town getting the cart around can be
a bit of a pain Its comparable but you also
have to deal with a cart
 Rissa leads you further through the Shelf At
this point once again the town is fairly quiet
and most folks you do see in the street are in the
process of carrying supplies There are a few
horsedrawn carts that have stacks of metal ingots
that are being taken from above or below or vice
versa You can see partially made metal plates and
curved structures of larger things that are being
developed and created separately and then all
being brought to a singular location probably
down near the artillery yard Its a very
interesting black and white day and night
separation of how the people live in this city A
short jaunt around probably the spell does fade
before you get there but youre still not picking
up any blip About a few minutes after the spell
fades you get to the outside of a small shack
Its got metallic siding there are rivets in it
You see it has a roof that is metal sheets There
is a smokestack on top thats giving out this lazy
smoke drip that makes its way into the sky and a
sign out front that says Tinkertop Inventions
 She goes  Rissa rolls her eyes and
knocks on the metallic door Yes Come in Dad
its me I have some friends here they just want
to say hi They got thieved Oh thats all
right come on in certainly  She opens
the door and on the inside you already hear the
whirring of hundreds of tiny clockwork objects On
the inside you can see wall to wall clocks of
all sizes Some broken springs exposed Some that
are fixed and clicking away Some that have small
sculptures that move in a circle around a central
area You can see partially made pulleys small
toys that are set up on the corner some wooden
some metal and all of them have some sort of
builtin clockwork locomotion to them though they
are currently still There are two sets of
lanterns that are hanging in the back giving the
faint light which is as you enter giving this
dark silhouette to a lot of these objects but as
you walk into the light and look behind you you
can see the detail work in them and theyre very
beautiful and very wellmade Its at that point you
hear a  Ah Ugh You glance over and you
can see hopping up and down running his hand
like this this older gnome character with patches
of whitegray hair this big bush of a white
beard Its welltrimmed up here and then comes to
a point at the bottom Very large spectacles with
a number of smaller and even smaller lenses in the
front of it Hes currently wearing a leather
apron and sleeves that are rolled up and one of
his hands is currently now bleeding on the edge
and hes like  Im terribly
sorry about that Come forward She said youre
the friends of my lass there How are you doing
Whats your names
 Oh did you dear Thats so nice Youre
making friends Rissas like Dad please stop
it Look they just wanted to come by they had
some questions I think Do what youre going to
do please so we get going
 The boys she mentioned earlier are a few
blocks down or a few buildings down and up from
where you are Well at the very least let me
introduce myself Im Mastermaker Cleff Tinkertop
 Cleff
 Creator and experimenter of all things
metallic and clicking
 Thank you so much I appreciate that So
yeah what can I do for you
 Whats
 You look over and Yashas still behind Kiri
 Hes like Thats a mighty big bird
 She leans forward looks up to him like
Cleff Shes a mighty big bird Hes like
Thats a nice trick on that one I like that
 Do you like and he pulls this small
contraption its actually a miniature version of
what you saw those large bolt throwers that were
constructed out front where it has this bowed arc
and theres a small blunted stick in it He goes
All you do is pull back on this trigger Ping
It fires off narrowly missing the side of Beaus
head hits something and you hear glass shatter
in the background and he goes Oh maybe not that one
Puts it back  And hands something over
to Kiri who accepts it Theres a moment where
things are awkward and theres a tension and
youre about to go before it opens up and from the
inside you see this tiny metallic bird its wings
flap up and down A music box begins to play
 and Kiri looking at this begins
mimicking exactly the sound of the music box
 Its almost one beat behind it
until it synchronizes and shes mimicking at such
an incredibly fast pace behind it that theyre
almost in unison until eventually it slows down
and comes to a stop Kiri looks back to you 
 Oh that one its a beautiful piece Ill
be happy to let it go for about three gold pieces
 Theres a whole smattering of cool
contraptions now that youre looking at the back too
Some that look like they could be armaments
almost Some that look like theyre the insides of
larger machine pieces
 Ah proud of now I have one thing Im
working on if you want to see it
 Okay Ive been hoping theyd pay attention
to this Since the whole wars going on I think
itd be quite useful Ive lost some good favor
with folks in power but I hope maybe this will
turn my fortune around He goes around off to
the shelf and pulls this down and a bow of some
kind thats affixed to this large device It looks
like a crossbow but its got a heavy crank on one
side and it has all these extra grooves put in
where its easy to assemble a bolt in there The
actual shaft of it is made of this polished
treated wood with metal casing where the grip is
Its like a halfclockwork gearbased crank hand
crossbow
 Well you lower the bolt into here and you
crank it back real fast and its like
 as he cranks it I probably have to
oil this Crank it Then you just release This
one goes just parting Calebs hair into the roof
above
 Well this one you see I had a friend of
mine go ahead and help prepare it
with some magical enchantment
 I call this one The Tinkertop Boltblaster

 This one runs just over  gold
 Well its my prototype so if Im going to
let it go
 Rissas like Dad they dont want it its
fine No one wants all your bullshit please
 You wouldnt say that if youd known what
some of his other things have done He gets quiet
for a second and recoils quietly hurt He goes
It comes with the job sometimes Not everything
works out like you hope
 Uh and Rissas like Ah its you
dont have to answer him We can go find the
boys Its all right Make a persuasion check
  You see his trepidation there and he
goes You look like youve got an honest face
the Gearhold Prison down below I was helping them
and came up with at their request what would be
a clockwork warden Something that could help keep
watch over some of the more dangerous and
difficult inmates of the prison below And I did
it I was very proud of it On its first foray it
had some faults I didnt see coming and we
couldnt control it It began to just destroy
whatever was in its way
 More or less
 They tell me They keep it down there
still Theyve sealed it off and its been
there for the better part of two years and every
now then they like to remind me I didnt mean
anything bad by it I was just doing my job and I
thought I was very proud of my work I didnt see
the problems there I was just trying to help
 They come by and tell me
 Thankfully not many Im still paying off
my fine They were going to try and destroy the
thing but unfortunately theyve had to allocate
their attention to many places and now with the
war coming I dont know if theyll ever get to
it But as long as its down there its a black
spot on my name and her name Rissa goes Dad
just please stop it
 I dont want to send any more people to
their death at the very least
 Good for you
 A learned lesson for the rest of you
 Im very proud of you I mean that sounds
very kind of folks that wandered in here naught
but a few moments ago
 Oh I dont want it back I just want it
gone I want it destroyed I want it taken care of
and buried I dont want to touch it
 You
 I dont think it could be used for anything
but just killing whats in front of it right now
 From what I know Youd have to go ask the
Wardenhelm I dont go down there places I mean
I cant expect you to do something like that Its
very sweet of you to offer
 I mean in a theoretical space which is
where I live most of my days if you were to put
this blight to rest Id be happy to give this to
you free of charge and my thanks
 I dont
 I dont delve in those places Im sorry
 I dont know whats going on
 I deal with more detailed arms If youre
looking for simple youre probably going to go to
the Steelbringers Forge Rissa goes Thats
where the boys will probably be Thats where they work
 Thank you very much
 Im always looking for fine oils Clockwork
tends to need to be lubricated
 Thats all right Dont worry about it
Thats okay If you come across some oil I could use it
 Rissa I like your friends Shes like
Thank you Dad
 Have you found work yet No Dad Im
working on it
 Right Im working for them
 Good good Proud of you
 Oh no Its still a living Thats more
than some folks in the Empire can say
 Any good gnome is incorporated I mean
thats a cultural thing
 th birthday they get their S Corp set up
Its great

 Of course I expect nothing I really
appreciate you being so kind Good luck
 Take care of my Rissania Shes like
 You can see her shiver at the door and then
just run out Goodbye Take care 
Something shoots off Oh damn it As you all
leave and exit out shes out there fuming outside
 Hes something Hes certainly something
 Okay You pocketed a bolt
 Right Come on Ill lead you over to where
the boys are You going to rough them up again
 Right Just right around the corner Come
on Ill show you
 Aye
 I know Hes just hes difficult at
times Its hard to scrape under a family name
when its been through the ringer
 She gives you a look over I agree
 You guys are led down past a few buildings
and then around the corner and while most of the
heavy metalworks is done down below on the ground
floor of the base of the mountain the more
refined metalworks are done up here on the Shelf
As you approach you can already see the
Steelbringers Forge which has a number of
shields and swords on display armor bits and you
can see simple tools are crafted here As you
step already looking into the main chamber door
which is open because its so hot in there they
have to keep a breeze going through there are
two forges going at any given point in time There
are two anvils set up You see a few gnomes at
work and indeed both Fitz and Ashton are both
working as assistants Theyre not actually
banging the hammer but theyre both helping move
things and quenching into the water and then
helping gather materials and holding the metal and
rotating it on the anvil as their bosses are
hammering down They dont seem to notice your
arrival
 
 Hold back boys There is one male gnome
and one female dwarf that are both sitting there
grabbing their nearby warhammers look around
They look over and see the shadows in the corner
What beast brings their way into our workplace
Name yourself
 They look at each other The dwarf female
goes  back to work You see the two
assistants look over and go and put their heads
down and keep focused on their work The gnome
says Just take a break Hi can we help you
 What did you do He slaps with a cloth
and the assistants like Ah I didnt gah
What did the boys do Whatd they do
 You can see across the way Ashtons like
 and the dwarf goes Well then best go
talk to them Gives them a little kick to the
side and they both take their hammers down They
take the metal off and put it back in the forge to
heat and they both rest and cross their arms and
watch The two boys look at each other and
sheepishly step forward Hi miss What can we
do What are you asking about Yeah what can we
do
 Rissa goes I dont know Kind of like to
do it in a place of business that way we can keep
it above the board you know
 They both grab nearby stools and sit down
 Deal Deal
 Whats the DC on that
 Which one Ashton or Fitz
 Fitz looks at you and goes and looks right
to Fjord the spell seemingly taking effect
 Oh no you know Im just
 His eyes go wide No not at all no What
I wouldnt I earn my money
 Ashton looks back No sir we were just
looking we were just joshing we were just
playing with Rissa that was all
 
 I dont know Maybe um
 Make an intimidation check
 Ill let you both make one because youre
doing it together
 They both look at each other and like
 There are probably some people who
couldve taken things I dont know There are
shady folk in there all the time We dont have
your money I swear I didnt do anything

 Ashtons like Come on Get it together
and kicks him and is like Were being completely
honest We saw nothing we took nothing We were
just getting our rocks off freaking people out
and then we went back and got some drinks
 Not personally no Most of them end up in
the Gearhold
 
 They both look at each other Well
originally he used to be an ice sailor up north
by Ice Haven but he retired ten years ago
 I dont know
 Ice sailor would be a person that forges the
frozen depths up north
 The people you see on The Deadliest Catch
Its that kind of a job
 Sure
 Okay okay
 He looks to Ashton Ashtons like Okay
 No well ask around Well do
thats okay When the bosses  You can look
when youre done with the forge When the whistles
blow Have at it
 Fitz is like I have to work Its my
livelihood
 Their spirits are pretty crushed right now
and theyre both like
 They both look at each other On a good
day We give them about a gold for a days work
 They nod The gnome steps forward takes the
coin if you present it
 Thats four gold so thats three of them
for the two gold He goes Okay you boys go get
your work done here and well find some
replacements and you hope they arent better than
you are The boys are like Yes Yes sir
Yes sir
 They get up and grab their stuff and then
dart out into the street
 The two forge workers
 Theres a pause like the two workers at the
forge look at each other and look at you guys and
go  Im not going to lie those boys are
going to be pissing their pants for a week after
that That was enjoyable
 I hope so They need it Theyre a couple
of pissants Anyway weve got to go find some
replacements but thank you for helping out with
the transition at least
 They both look at each other and be like
Maybe ask down at the Assembly Yard Theres a
bunch of weird folks that wander down there
 Lifelong industrial hammer workers Not a
lot of craft and skill Mind gets a bit addled
 Of course Anyway weve got to go get back
to work
 You guys wander outside
 Oh no We dont specialize in firearms
Those are all regulated by the Empire Those are
designed down in the Assembly Yard
 Or that would be the Iron Lot is where that
would be made
 No they seemed pretty standard I mean
wellmade Looks like a lot of places like this
are in the process of developing weaponry not
just for home use but probably sending it out for
the field
 She goes The Assembly Yard is down in the
bottom half of the city so its say about an
hour hour and a half walk
 Well thats that way about  minutes to
get to the actual Falls themselves and you see
all the little towers over there those are where
all the homes are assembled in that place
 With Rissa guiding you guys back you manage
to make your way outside of the main Idle Shelf
area and in towards the cluster of the Silver
Falls As you approach you can see the beautiful
very wide waterfall that cascades down about a
thousand feet across the mountainside until
eventually it falls into this large lake where
you can see columns of steam are rising up The
closer you get you begin to realize that there is an
element of this lake this waterfall and some
sort of a steam enginetype mechanism built into
the surrounding rock that they use to fuel
probably the furnaces and elements of the
technology within this city As you begin to hit
the residential area you can see these large
somewhat crookedlooking towers that themselves
are maybe what would be the equivalent of  to
squarefoot apartments but stacked four or
five on top of each other with spiraling stairs
on the outside to go to each level There arent a
lot of folks currently at home other than
stayathome dads or moms that are watching
children some folks that are putting out laundry
on lines that are connecting between multiple
towers and are dangling up two or three stories
above the street But theyre all made of dark
irons and blacker metals so it gives the district
this very weirdly whats the word Im looking
for A whimsical Industrial Revolution feel Its
a unique mixture
 Kind of Or a hint of Howls Moving Castle
in places Theres also that spray of the
waterfall hitting the lake behind which gives
occasionally this light misting of water through
the air You can see faint bits of rainbow that
come through where the mist hits the sunlight as
it makes its way across the waterfall spray
 Mmhmm
 No not at all
 Oh yeah very much so
 Okay As you make your way through youre
not entirely sure where Ol Blemmy is but you
make your way towards where the middle Rissa
says of the district is
 Sure Make a perception check
 Its a ndlevel spell Do you want to cast
it again or not
 The tokens
 Okay you cast Locate Object You
concentrate and focus extending your
consciousness focusing on one of these wooden
tokens the one that was won by one of the members
of your party  You get a blip behind you
Not quite in the district but right where the
Idleworks Shelf transitions into the residential
area on the Idleworks Shelf You get 
 You guys dart after Jester making your way
down the road running  Youre closing
the distance You weave through a couple
buildings Youre out of the residential part of
the district again and youre back into the Idle
Shelf but on the very back end of it Theres
warehouses and theres small buildings and
eventually you come to the destination and it
looks like its a small building Theres a sign
out front that just says Butcher And its
boarded up
 You see Kiri pulls out her knife and goes
 I can send a message
  Shh Nice
 There is a roof yeah
 Its one story Its not a huge building
Its maybe three rooms
 Make an acrobatics check
 Shes already up
 Okay
 All right You guys surround it landing
footfalls
 There isnt a skylight per se but you do
see there is a little smokestack thats about
three feet wide or so Two and a half feet wide
 Make a perception check
  Glancing inside its dark except for
you can see the little beams of sunlight that are
coming through the slats of wood on the roof
 Glancing inside looking through you can
see four figures in there that are currently not
moving and theyre all clustered together in the
far corner
 They look gnome in size
 Theyre huddled together and theyre not
moving
 You look and theyre starting to look
around like they might have heard a noise
 No theres a door in the front and a door
at the back The door in the front is like a
sectional door a top and a bottom looks like it
can be opened separately to sell out or wants to
bring and sell meat over that side The back is
just a general door it looks almost like a
storage space or a back entry to it
 There are windows but theyre boarded
over
 You can try yeah You can certainly try
  It goes off On the inside is
a flash of light You hear screams
 You guys all burst inside As you break
through the doors wood splinters on the inside
light breaks in and in the corner you can see
what looks to be four gnomish children
 Two of them teenage two of them younger
all scared out of their minds The teenagers are
trying to protect the two younger ones You can
see a pile of gold around them on the ground
Theyre just like 
 There is a gnome girl the equivalent of
like  or so with very brown curled hair its
this uncontrolled mass dirty on the cheek A
younger boy with short red hair is the other
protector of the two Their clothes are pretty
dirty Then theres the younger girl that you saw
wandering through the tavern whos on the ground
clutching a stuffed bear
 You see a boy thats a little older than
her about nine you would say equivalent with
very long brown hair thats around the shoulders
and they all just look scared
 Shes not talking
 You look up as she comes out the bottom in a
big old plume of soot Just covered
 The older girl Look we dont mean
nothing were just trying to get by okay We
didnt realize how much you had on you and to be
honest it was both exciting and scary Just dont
hurt anyone please
 Take it
 The girl looks sad for a moment saying
Not for a little while
 Weve scrambled coins here and there over
time keep on by Most everyone here only keeps a
few coins in their pockets Hence our surprise
when this came about The younger boy goes like
Yeah we dont expect this kind of a payload
 The older girl goes Im Gail Im 
 The older boy goes Im Austin The little
boy with longer curly hair goes Im Jude The
older girl points to the little girl and goes
Thats Layla
 They all look at each other and the older
boy sits forward and goes Well they got
arrested
 Got arrested for idol worship False
worship
 No Changebringer
 Avandra Its been in the family for a long
time Every six months the tithe collectors come
through and they noticed theyd forgotten to put
away their idol worship They locked them up
Theyve been in the Gearhold ever since
 You know about those Those of you whove
been in the Empire part of living in the Empire
is about every six months or so theres a tax
man a tithe collector that goes through usually
with a couple crownsguard You recognize them by
black cloak with gold trim usually dark clothing
They go building to building business to
business inspect ledgers ask about their
business look at the means in which theyre
living and then make an estimation of what they
owe They then collect the money and move on their
way But you know this from your studies this is
also used as a means of inspecting for any illegal
activity and anything that goes against the Crown
Often a lot of people get arrested for that
 We are
 Gilda and Wallace Schuster Were
Schusters
 Only about three months
 So far so good Most people dont seem to
pay much attention to the younger kids
 We just grab it and run we didnt know how
much was here until we got back
 Right no I understand Gail says We
understand sir Weve learned our lesson
 Thank you
 Ive been trying best we can Our parents
worked as butchers so we had some food to keep us
going for a while but when stuff got thin and
begging wasnt working out we you know did what
was necessary And Ill do what it takes to make
sure my siblings stay healthy
 Weve held up here This is where we grew
up
 Anytime now really Its been six months
But we aint much of a business at this time
 I hear stories they round them up and
throw them to Rexxentrum in orphanages and we
dont want to go there
  How would you intend on
getting my parents out of the prison
 I mean legally Wed probably stay here
and reopen the shop
 If it were by means where people would come
looking for us we would definitely be heading
somewhere other than here
 All right
 Hey man attach them all by chains to your
armor and you guys are the new Dread Emperor
 Insight check
 Yes Do I believe him
 Frustratingly so yes
 I find it amusing
 Lets see we had about three days traveling
there Since you left you have about two and a
half weeks Ill say estimated at the moment
 I would say off the top of my head a
little under a week
 At this point its probably pushing one or
two in the afternoon
 You did yeah Do you give that to them
 The kids hungrily accept and devour evenly
dividing amongst them They feed the younger kids
first and then whatever is left over the older
ones take They say Thank you I really
appreciate that
 All right
 Well keep that in mind thank you Thank
you kindly Is it a ring finger a finger ring
 He puts it over his thumb For his body and
size it goes over his thumb Its still a little
loose but itll stay Thank you I dont know
how well repay you but
 Yeah Yashas like No if were going into
a prison to kill something I want to be there
 Kiri goes  That sounds
adorable
  Okay
  The little girl walks up and
touches the feathers and you see the feathers of
Kiris head  and her eyes close for a
second as shes scratching the side of her head
   It starts
playing and the little girl leans in and they all
close in quickly For a moment you can see this
little unit of kids meeting a new friend and a
friend meeting new kids Youre like okay they
might be okay for a little bit
 They all nod to you Kiri looks to Fjord and

   Okay
  Stay quiet
 Leaving the kids there you all quietly exit
the building reaffirming the doors you had kicked in
 There you go You manage to get the doors
back into a sizeable place and begin to discuss how
youre going to tackle this next endeavor And
thats where well finish this weeks episode
Well pick up next week
 Well done guys
 Well see if
 See if you can earn your Tinkertop 
Boltblaster 
 Hey man Good game guys Awesome
 Oh my goodness
 My God And on that note Have a wonderful
week guys Well see you next Thursday for the
next stage of this crazy adventure Remember we
love you and is it Thursday yet Good night

 And welcome back
 That was great So last we left off
 The
Mighty Nein in making their way northward towards
their eventual goal of Shadycreek Run to complete
their second mission that they accepted from The
Gentleman in Zadash have been traversing the
countryside and made their way to the city of
Hupperdook the largely gnomish cultural city
there of industry and currently construction of
war machines to send towards the conflict with
Xhorhas to the east There you saw the very hardy
work atmosphere of the gnomes and then the
evening very crazy party atmosphere in which many
of you dove into a hard drinking contest You won
the title of the Blushing Tankard Tavern beating
out their old champions and woke up with terrible
hangovers and realizing that most of your gold
had been stolen Upon doing some sleuthing around
the town you had bullied a couple of bullies that
were pushing Rissa around they had been a problem
for a while sent them peeing their pants and
rushing You spoke with Rissas father in his
tinkering inventors store in which you
discovered a shiny object a fantastic
experimental hand crossbow construct of his that
he would be interested in relinquishing without
payment if you do him the favor of correcting a
mistake he made a while back Apparently he
crafted on the request of the Starosta of the
city a powerful Gearkeeper a constructlike
entity that was meant to help be a warden within
the prison that went crazy killed a bunch of
people and they sealed it off and its been there
forgotten ever since You said youd take a look
at this Eventually you discovered that the money
you had lost had been taken by four children who
currently are without parents who have been
living on the streets here in the city of
Hupperdook while their folks had been sent to the
prison six months before for being caught
worshiping unapproved deities within the Empire
You after having this conversation with them
retrieving your money and leaving Kiri with them
for the time being for safekeeping decided to see
if you had the possibility to prevent them from
being sent to an Empirerun orphanage in the
hopes of freeing their parents in some way shape
or form from their binds That was where we had
left off
 You guys have stepped out of the butcher
home leaving the kids behind with Kiri and you
are now out in the open streets of Hupperdook
late morning midday What would you like to do
 Rissa is still with you
 No I am going to hold onto this Why would
I give it to you
 Im not going anywhere why would I give it
to you This is my bag I paid for it
 Rissa goes All right I can go ahead and
lead you to it Cant say Ive been too close to
it personally so far Follow me Rissa guides
you through the rest of the shelf back to the
walkway that winds down the front of the mountain
to the bottom half of the city of Hupperdook
 Lowerdook if you will
 Theyre with you guys You can go head that
way if you want to call them off unless you want
to send them on their own wild goose chase
 I could maybe send them a message
 I do
 Okay
 She quietly tugs on the symbol of the
Traveler and goes like Okay Fitz This is the
girl with the people that were making you
angry
 We found it so
 Everything is good
 I think thats all of it
Gobacktowork
 The Traveler is very forgiving
 Rissa leads you down this path to the Iron
Lot which is youre guided to the basement
Youve seen it as you approached and there was the
large platform elevator that rose up to the second
layer Its currently not being used its locked
on the upper floor As you head into that area
the smokestacks are billowing strongly business
is in the process of being done fullthrottle in
the understanding that this coming conflict or the
now arrived conflict on the eastern side has put
everyone into overdrive to prepare whatever sort
of equipment or weaponry they can send that
direction
 Well from the outside all you can see
because you havent been inside any of the
warehouses There is the Iron Lot and theres the
Assembly Yard The Assembly Yard is the one thats
the open space where theyre building these large
siege engines You see mobile carts that are
either horsedrawn or powered by something you
dont quite understand yet that have other large
weapons attached to them
 Mmhmm
 Yes So as you are being led down Rissas
pointing out some elements of it She goes Okay
so over that side is the Omnismelter She points
over to a cluster of a dozen or so warehouses that
are scattered in a spider weblike formation that
are connected by a series of hallways between each
other and then towards a central piece She goes
That there is where most of the foundries of the
city lie Where all the various mined ingots or
those imported are melted down and utilized The
foreman there is a bit of a tool Theres the
Armavault She points to the far northern side of
the mountain base and you see a  foot tall
by foot across iron door that is solid and
jammed into the side of this mountain It looks
like its very well protected from this glance at
the distance From what you can see theres maybe
two dozen or so crownsguard that are stationed at
its base Thats where most of the funds that are
saved for the uses of the city maintain as well as
a number of the not currently being used devices
of war Means of defending the city should it come
under attack if you will Points over there You
can see what looks to be where most of this smoke
and steam is rising from There is this one large
twostory black tower that has a single column of
fast moving smoke pouring out of it You can see
areas where the smoke seems to be pulsing or
darkening and widening at certain places She
goes That there is the Underbellows Thats
where they utilize a number of the forges and
furnaces for the factories here Theyve harnessed
some of the volcanic activity beneath the mountain
and that maintains a consistent heat for the
forges Smells downright awful to be honest Over
theres the Firemark Facility She points over to
a building that looks a little simpler Its not
super tall and ominouslooking Its very plain
made of cheap metals You notice all the buildings
here are mostly metal probably because theres a
lot of dealing with heat fire sparks and the
last thing you need is any of these things to
catch fire She points though to the Firemark
Facility and she goes This is where theyre
developing a majority of certain explosive and
black powderbased technologies
 Its called the Firemark Facility
  Most everything is here Then
right over there and she points to the southern
side of the mountain base of the Iron Lot to a
smaller doorway Similar in shape and construction
as to the Armavault but its a little more
localized Maybe about foot high and about
foot wide That is the Gearhold Prison The
one you were asking about The one where my father
done fucked up
 Its have you ever seen an automaton
where theyre made of stone or made of clay
 Imagine one thats made of metal and gears
and blades Lots of blades
 Blades
 It is covered in Daywalkers yes
 They do The whole thing spins actually
It doesnt have feet
 Basically
 Partially magical and partially
clockwork
 The power source is magical but most of
its actual locomotion is done through clockwork
and various internal gears Its actually quite a
marvel to behold Its just
 As far as I know Its not my mastery Its
my daft fathers
 He referred to it as the Gearkeeper
 It was designed to be one of the
threatening wardens to help quell any sort of
breakouts of the prison Meant as an intimidation
device for those who attempted to rise up against
their captors and possibly be its first initial
run to be a defensive sentinel for the city If
these things worked properly having five or six
of them just rapidly on the outskirts of the city
would probably keep anyone from trying to break in
here or make any sort of lawless act in its
boundaries Unfortunately theyve only made one
and it went crazy and killed a bunch of people So
theres that
 Yeah thats why Im trying to fix it
 They sealed it off Theyve been trying to
get back to it but theres a lot of distraction
and honestly its out of sight out of mind I
think
 As far as I know yeah Theyd originally
had it placed in the bottom floor in one section
which had more of the very violent criminals and
killed a bunch of them Not too bad Killed a
bunch of guards Thats pretty bad At the time
they didnt have the manpower to fight it off so
they sealed the doors and havent had a problem
since
 Its been there for quite some time A
couple years at least I think Two or three
years So if anyone was theyve expired Im
pretty sure Sorry
 Thats true
 Jester leans in to Rissa and goes Rissa
Do you have any examples of your fathers writing
because I can copy it pretty well
 Shell be watching
 I can guarantee you theyre not going to
have any publicly available blueprints of a prison
 Oh
 We can certainly ask
 You see that spark in her eye of a good idea
and then thinking about having to go back to her
father shes like 
 No its fine Ill go Im used to him
Its okay Come on
 I imagine he does Ive seen him eat a
few
 Probably
 Okay
 Fjord kind of leans in and goes Thats
good Jester
 Has been
 I have too much in my head right now guys
Its been a long day
 Its fine
 Thanks Baby Willingham
 Its been the longest day
 All right Easy enough as youre wandering
through the street following the scents of food
that are being cooked in advance of the current
lunch hour happening You hear a few whistles go
off in the distance and in that moment Rissa
goes We best be hurrying before the rush hits
And you pick up the pace as you start hearing the
different steam whistles go off and you watch a
lot of the buildings begin to just swarm out with
all their workers on their brief lunch break You
manage to stay ahead of most of the wave making
their way up to the top shelf of the city
eventually coming to one of the vendors on the
outside who is swarmed by about  or  different
gnomes You wait patiently for about a good  
minutes or so as they prepare and get all their
meat pies ready sweet pies ready Sell a few
things a couple of their regulars cut in line in
front of you not paying much attention or caring
that youre waiting patiently But there is a
large crowd behind you and you manage to get to
the front and the two gnomes that are currently in
the process of divvying this up look to the
rest of you and go Oh youre a right
interesting team What brings you here You
looking for pies We got pies You want pies
 Single
 Its not enough to go around I can tell
you
 All right Turns around and pulls out
three gnomesized meat pies which are about that big
 Six gnomish meat pies
 Passes them over
 Okay Well say for the total of that its
maybe a silver
 Because you were rushing to get the pies
make a perception check with disadvantage at this
distance
 Seven You have no idea
 You have your meat pies You want to make
your way over back to the Tinkertop
 All right So you have one ready You guys
snack as you walk along Interesting point of
noticing as you guys come by you do see a
familiar sight for you and for those whove been
in the Empire for a bit Youre familiar with this
as well Nott and Caleb
 You see a crew Its two crownsguard that
are flanking one figure you see wearing a black
cloak with gold trim that goes just past the
shoulders Its almost like a shawl or a um
brain escapes the term But its like a short
cloak
 These are the tithe collectors
 Theyre referred to colloquially as Reapers
behind their back but you see them exiting one
home and moving onto the next door and knocking
 A ways away but theyre present It seems
that the time of year has come the
everysixmonth window seems to be coming or has
arrived Nevertheless you travel with meat pie in
hand eventually making your way back to Tinkertop
Inventions the door still partially ajar You see
the faint light of the two lanterns in the back as
you enter and there in the back you see in the process
of sketching something down your good friend
Mastermaker Cleff Tinkertop Ah youve returned
Certainly good to see you What can I help you
with
 Oh thats so kind Thank you so much
 Rissa for your old pops did you Shes
like Well it was sort of a group decision Hope
you like it Dad Its cold but tasty Anyway
He takes it and starts eating it stuffing it in
chunks through his gnomish maw getting bits of
the gravy dripping off of the chin
 Plenty I built the thing myself Dont
worry
 Oh Ive already got it Dont worry there
friend Ill be right back Turns around and
disappears behind a
 You hear some rustling and some things
falling over A couple of banging noises and then
you hear a  Damn it
 Yeah I can hear you just so youre aware
Im right next to you little one
 A moment later Cleff returns clutching an
armful of rolled pieces of paper and prints and
parchment and goes Heres about everything Ive
got on the thing Throws it down in front of you
some of it unrolls Theres various stages of
design the breakdown of the mechanics and the
interior of this Its extremely intricate and
very impressive clockwork Roll an intelligence check
 Caleb you are the one who is the most
proficient with understanding systems If you
could make an intelligence check for me as well
both you and Molly since Molly was the first to
grab them
 You both take a moment and look over it
One its all written in Gnomish Do either of
you guys understand Gnomish as a language
 Secondly a lot of the blueprints are in
shorthand and the design work while its very
beautiful to see the actual sketching of each
stage of its construction and the interior
mechanisms about it are very beautiful it is very
intricate Paying attention to it and looking it
over the best you can ascertain is there is a
core There is some sort of a device that powers
it Through the notes around it its supposed to
power for about  years before it needs
replacing
 However around it is layer after layer of
metallic iron rings that are joined at certain
hinge points so they can spin and shift in the
inside like a gyroscope
 Yes Its not impossible if you pull enough
of the armor away which is the next stage the
layers of armor Theres three different layers of
articulated armor that can shift and move because
on the inside there are about a dozen bladed arms
that at any given point in time can fold out of
the armor and strike like small scythes or sickles
and then retract inside
 Thats certainly not the first time Ive
heard that
 I mean thats possible Oh curses I
shouldve thought of some way of a failsafe to
prevent that from happening Well next design
Next design itll be dispelproof Thank you for
that Youre a good
 I imagine to a certain extent There is a
base level of insulation from impactful or various
magical intrusions that could affect the core
that I did think of But theres only really one
I shouldve put three
 He starts making notes feverishly
 The front and back is Dervish Thats a
great pirate word dervish He looks to you and
goes There is kind of He goes through one of
the papers and pulls it open and there are plates
of the armor certain plates that fold up from
the inside They open and there is a small lens
like a crystaltype lens that recesses on the
inside when its moving and then seems to push out
from it to see
 Depending on the terrain probably If its
flatwalled surfaces its not designed for
climbing Its designed for intimidation and
slaughtering Perhaps my design was a bit
unfocused for the reason they asked me to build
it but ah Next time Climbing I dont know
probably not
 As far as I know no but it moves very
fast
 Maybe Theyre made of a very thick
crystalline substance that had to be imported from
up north from the remnants of one of the old elven
societies there that specialized in making strong
crystal
 Maybe
 Starts writing down more notes Make sure
lens cant be obscured in a future design
 No I built it here
 Oh right
 No unfortunately they keep us away from
all of that for security reasons So I couldnt
help people break in or out Like now 
That wouldve been very helpful Sorry
 I dont think theyre going to let me in
 Maybe He looks at Rissa Rissa would
you mind bringing your old pops with you Shes
like Only to the door Dad then you can come
back She glares over the two of you If thats
necessary
 Fine come along then Well close up
behind get your keys Oh I havent been down
for a proper walk with friends in some time Im
so excited
 He takes the last bit of meat pie and shoves
it in his mouth real fast
 
 Jester goes This entire time youve been
holding out on delicious molasses
 Are you sure
  Yeah how much you carrying
  Piechucker
 Rissa goes I mean tar is not uncommonly
used in some of the industrial districts down in
the Iron Lot
 Well the forge masters theyre mainly in
metalwork As far as tar use thats going to be
down in the Iron Lot and thats going to be
youre on your own there
 Fjord goes If only we knew someone around
here who is pretty decent with fire
 Why thank you I appreciate you being so
forthright and appreciative Caleb
 I have no idea what the hell youre talking
about
 You just broke the Prismatic Wall
 At this point as you guys are having this
awkward conversation Cleff is rushing around
grabbing a coat and grabbing some other things
filling the inside of his apron with various tools
and utensils Oh I can probably use that All
right I think Im ready to come with you
 You all step outside and you get about 
or so feet before you see Cleffs pace is slowing
He takes another step and keeps looking around
 Its been a while Its starting to get a
little warm Rissa is like Hes kind of a
whats the term
 Agoraphobic if you will Hes a bit iffy
on the outside Are you sure youre all right
Dad You can still stay No no its fine I
want to hang out with my friends here 
 I dont Ive never had a drink I dont
need a drink but thank you
 Well I and looks over
 You all get really close to him Hes like
Oh this is really warm This is a lot of attention
 Oh all right
 
 He takes it and pulls it over his head All
right and he Lets go  And
is like One step two step Hes basically Bill
Murray in What About Bob at this point Hes
concentrating on each step he makes going
forward Its slowing you down a little bit but
hes making it forward Rissa is like
 You eventually make your way
further and further
 You know if I have learned anything it is
that you are full of surprises So by all means
 Rissa looks Iron Lots most likely Ill
keep an eye out follow me She leads you guys
down the switchback path once more down to the
Iron Lot the bottom shelf of the city There
upon keeping an eye out Rissa is looking back and
forth On the outskirts of the Firemark Facility
shes like No I dont think theyre going to do
much as far as tar goes Honestly a lot of its
probably based somewhere in the Assembly Yard
Thats where theyre making the bigger constructs
and having to piece together wood exteriors
 No its on the northern side of the bottom
shelf She leads you guys over to the outskirts
and there is a big fence that wraps around the
Assembly Yard where a lot of these thin standing
skeletal towers of metal are placed against some
constructs that are in partial levels of
construction Others are empty and not currently
in use Other ones seem to have been near
completion and theyre in the process of
preparing and breaking down the various siege
engine for transport to the east Whos keeping an
eye out to see if theres anything that could be
used like tar Whos looking for this
 All right make a perception check please
  not too bad You take about five minutes
or so to case the vicinity and looking between
the gate you can see two towers over there is one
partially constructed wide boltthrower cart that
only has one thats currently bolted to it You see that
theyre taking leather elements and tarring them
around the edges to prevent any sort of impacts
from splintering the wood thats carrying it It
looks like from there they go with a leather case
and put metal over that and bolt it down But in
the process they do have what looks to be a couple
of small pails that have some thick black
tarlike substance that theyre putting around the
edges
 Theres probably within current view of the
open portion of this side of the Assembly Yard
about  or so workers that are in the middle of
focusing on their work at hand But its in an
open space with maybe  to  feet open between
each project tower So its pretty open Youd
have to be creative
 Correct
 As you do so  across it
Rissa goes Ah And you look at the nearby
tower maybe  or  feet ahead to the north of
you one of the gnomes at the top of the tower is
currently hammering away at one of the large
constructs siege towerlike structures Looks
over pulls the goggles up Hello
 Piss off Puts the goggles down

 The nearest the one little part of the
yard that theyre currently using this material is
about  feet away from you  to  from your
immediate guess at a glance
 Okay
 Make an investigation check
 Ten You take the ten minutes to look
through but this part of the gate is pretty
solidly locked in Its about six and a half
seven feet tall and its just metal bars with
almost a crosslattice of even thinner metal
strips that are about a quarterinch thick The
openings are about that big so you can still see
through like portholes but its not quite large
enough for most of you to slip through You might
be able to if youre careful and squeeze since
youre small enough
 Gnomes and you see a handful of dwarves
but the dwarves seem to be mostly doing oversight
supervision
 So you complete your spell ritual You
summon your Unseen Servant
 At which point Cleff goes Oh Were going
to see a performance
 And the range on that is It cannot get
more than  feet than you right
 Okay So what are the two of you doing
 All right So
 There are large metal poles incrementally
about every  or so feet In between there it
looks like there are cross lattices of an inch
wide and a quarterinch thick metal bars that
weave across to form the fence
 Probably not
 All right You guys are prepared
 I would like you to make an acrobatics check
with advantage because youre being aided by
Yasha
 Ten As you reach down grabbing the foot of
Mollymauk with one big  you lift him and
he tosses in the air gracefully arms out almost
like a reverse swan dive into the air You land
and 

 Land legs open you manage to miss the vital
areas but it definitely wracks the inside of the
thigh a little bit a painful landing
 You manage to do so but it lacks the
presentational and grace element of it Make a
performance check but with disadvantage from the
impact
  okay Still pretty good So in spite of
the  impact you slowly stagger back up
to the top balance yourself
 All right youre turning it around Its
starting to work into your advantage As this is
happening Schmidt is slowly dragging on its own
the Unseen Servant is dragging this bucket three
feet at a time 
 None seem to be noticing the bucket at the
moment but you do see about three or four that
are looking over at this very colorful flashy
performing nearly wracked tiefling who is in the
process of juggling swords in the air and doing a
series of completely spontaneous performance art
for no reason
 You see two of the nearby workers start
looking over confused start talking to each
other You can hear the muttering One of them
runs off to one of the supervisor dwarves whos
about  to  feet off to go tell him whats
happening He looks over and eventually you hear
as Schmidt is getting closer and closer the
bucket of tar is maybe  feet from the
fenceline and you hear a voice go Hey Hey
What are you doing Get down from there Get go
on get get get
 Straight acrobatics for this
   Landing right onto
Yashas shoulders She catches you there and
youre still from their perspective you jumped
off of the fence and landed behind the fence and are
 Make a deception check
 Nine okay Its not that they dont buy it theyre just
more caught offguard by your presence and not
listening to the words youre saying The one
supervisor who keeps rushing forward goes You
know lad you dont have permission Show me
your At which point you see Cleff looking
nervously steps forward and goes Hello there
Cleff Tinkertop were all right Theyre with
me The dwarf comes to a slow jog to a stop and
goes Cleff what the fuck are you doing down
here Schmidt drags the bucket about  feet off
to the side and it is near the base of the fence
 Okay
 Yes they are looking
 Its about  feet to the left but
theyre currently focused on your group which is
gathered at the edge of the yard where they
assemble all of their very powerful military
weapons
 Right so it was about  feet well say
So are you attempting to
 All right
 Its actually right now with that final
scoot from Schmidt its right up against the
fence on the opposite side
 Okay At this point the dwarf rushes up to
the edge and peers through and goes So strange
arrivals you got here Cleff and a couple of
loonies diving off the outside of our very
wellprotected fence but sure Cleff whats your
business with these assholes Hes like Were
making our way to try and make right some mistakes
Ive made certainly hopefully He glances through
with a bit of a tightened gaze and goes All
right Well just keep them off my fence
 Turns around and starts walking back to his
post
 Make a sleight of hand check to see if you
can make the right timing and do so swift enough
to where nobody seems to notice
 With that as soon as the dwarf turns around
and all the rest of the workers go right back
simultaneously seeing that this encounter is
over turn back to their work  Without
a sound rises over the fence and is now at your
disposal on the opposite end
  Rissa goes All right thats the first
part of it Whats next
 She takes it and slowly puts it inside It
will fit in the larger one so it slips inside the
bag She closes it Okay Are you sure it wont
turn over
 I dont want to ruin my bag
 I paid good money for it and its so
pretty
 Carefully hands it to Yasha
 Rissa continues pushing you now away from
the Assembly Yard back into the Iron Lot and
towards the exterior of the Gearhold Prison
There on the outside of this doorway theres
about a dozen crownsguard mostly gnomish two
human It looks like theyre both currently
decorated with a bit more detail probably sent
from the capital or at least are given a little
more of import to the outside of this guarding
post As you approach you can see these large
metal doors There are two of them and they open
in the center and there are a set of smaller
doors built in the base of each of the sides As
you approach some of the crownsguard look over
curiously at this interesting wayward group
making their way towards the outside Three of
them begin to approach and one of the humans in
the more intricate crownsguard uniform approaches
throwing the cloak over his shoulder and you can
see his hand resting on the handle of his
nowsheathed sword Hey who goes there What is
your business
 Cleff pulls the hood back a bit and goes
Hello Guy takes a moment and looks Make a
persuasion check with advantage because Cleff is
helping you
 The guard steps back a bit looks you over
All right Hold tight a second Im going to
summon the warden Just a moment He steps to one
of the small doors that opens and he disappears inside
 Theres the two large main doors about 
feet tall about  foot wide and then theres
smaller doors normal personsized almost
gnomishsized doors built into it from that
point You actually watch as the human crownsguard
has to duck a little bit to go through the smaller
door frame Hes gone for about five minutes or
so and then returns and says The Wardenhelm
would wish to speak to you if you wouldnt mind
stepping inside Dont mind the escort its
common business
 Its Wardenhelm Poppin Drokrusher
 Poppin Drokrusher
 Hes like Gnomish names
 At that point you guys are led inside the
dark interior As soon as you step into the shadow
of the entryway of this prison you go from the
industrial and somewhat colorless Iron Lot that
youve been traveling through to this very
lowlit reddish almost oxidized iron interior
that is just shadow and torches You can see these
large support beams of metal put against the rock
and stone that has been carved out of the interior
of the mountain Its just one long hallway that
splinters off into a number of hallways to the
right and left before it reaches the outside of
your current visual range to make any more detail
out of it At this point as you enter about five
more of the crownsguard follow behind you and keep
you all as a small pack traveling At this point
he begins to move forward and gestures for you all
to follow saying This way Leads you down the
hall scooting to the right and heads to the right
at the very first branching hallway of the
interior of the prison Heading further down
theres a few doors that are open and on the
inside they appear to be empty or theres a few
other guards On the interior you dont see much
in the way of crownsguard you see a different
type of guard Similar garb but more drab and
you get the sense that theyre this is an
internal prison guard this isnt part of the
paid trained citywide guard These are the
interior Hupperdook prison guards No more than
maybe another  or so feet down theres a
doorway thats open that leads into an office On
the inside of this office which itself is also
super darkly lit you see two ember torches that
give this very dull red glow on the inside of the
room so it has this somewhat ominous and dreary
interior presence to it as you step into this
chamber The desk is facing away from you and
there you see an older and grizzled gnome who is
in the process of wearing these series of robes
and cloak over him with these goldcolored tassels
and epaulets that shoot off the sides seems to be
giving out an air of station and importance even
though its just in the process of filing what
looks to be either prison transfers or people that
have been arrested and figuring out whos to be
put in here and why or whose business is going to
come to an end soon Hes in the process of
shuffling through papers before turning around to
you and goes All right so you have come to my
prison Stands up and turns around to you
clicking his feet together as he does so at
attention arms crossed Hello Im the
Wardenhelm Poppin You have bothered me from my
work and I would like to know why As you look
at him you can see his hair has receded almost
entirely to the back and what bits of clustered
gray hair on the sides hes currently attempted to
slick and comb back and one large part of it is
trying to cover the massive bald spot but as he
spins around and talks to you with any sort of
movement it wobbles and has to settle itself back
into place
 Respectful I appreciate that
 Rissa has backed away to the doorway and is
like and doesnt want any part in this
 Wait what are you And he looks over
towards the cloaked gnomish figure to the side
What
 He leans forward and as the cloak is pulled
back Cleff reveals his face a bit He goes
Hello there Its been a while How are you
doing Poppin Hes like Interesting riffraff
youre bringing to my home this day
 I was referring to Cleff Cleff why do you
come and bother me with my days work What do you
want Youre saying something about your little
mistake your problem
 He looks at Cleff Is this true Cleff
nods Actually yes I know its been a problem
for a while and I figured about time I cleaned up
that mess myself if you dont mind The
Wardenhelm stops for a second and looks amongst
the rest of you Right okay You have what
appears to be an interesting crew of exterminators
youve brought to me What do you want from me I
assume you have come here for trade or for looking
for some sort of recompense I would like to know
what that is before we move further into this No
one steps inside here wishing to do us how you
say Charity work
 Make a persuasion check with advantage
with aiding from Beau and a very persuasive
argument actually
 Oh buddy
 Well perhaps we can discuss but I would
like to see possibly this deed you wish to do done
first I do not wish to talk contracts with those
who are about to die if you know what Im saying
 Very well He looks past you to the escort
of guards that have followed you in Lead them to
the subterranean sealed chamber Allow them to
encounter our issue and should they survive
return them to me with proof of the deed Should
they not survive we will not speak of this ever
again Good luck I will be here waiting to hear
of your successful endeavor Now leave me to my
work He goes and sits back down in his chair
 Cleff and Rissa balk there as you guys are
having this conversation Rissa goes If its not
a problem Ill stay here with my dad and well
just wait to hear what happens Were not much in
the way of charging into the fray
 Of course Cleff pushes past and goes But
before you go I just want once more to express my
extreme gratitude for your putting yourself out
there for my wellbeing A Tinkertop never forgets
these deeds and should you return safely I will
be in your debt He bows and the cloak 
onto the groundand he goes Oh He picks it
back up and bows a little less this time
 Be careful
 Oh it doesnt have feet It rolls
 You guys currently have a group of six
crownsguard from the outside and a couple of
prison guards that will lead you there
 Jester goes Well dont die and if you
fall over Ill try to get you not on the ground anymore
 How is she out of spells You guys took a
long rest
 She used two Locate Objects I know that
 Theyre ndlevel I think Isnt it
 Yeah Locate Object is ndlevel
 Shes used two ndlevel spells
 So well mark those in there If she had
another its fine Shes not here to keep track
 Well it only lasts for a minute
 The guards have led you away from that end
of the chamber down the hall back to the main
hallway that enters deeper into the Gearhold
Prison Following that down for another  or so
feet that main open hallway comes to an end and
there are a number of other small hallways that
protrude The guards lead you down the one on the
left You can see two immediately that branch off
on the far end of that main open way That
leftside pathway leads to a set of stairs that
spirals down to a second floor Then a third
floor Then a fourth floor The fourth floor is
the bottom of these stairs and youre now
probably guessing from the time its taken you to
descend the spiral staircase maybe an additional
 to  feet below the entrance and the actual
level base of the mountain At this point you
continue down a hallway and there are cells to
your right and left As you enter the space the
cells are very wellfortified and behind the
bars in the dark dark red emberlike torchlight
that faintly glows and lights elements of this
hallway as you continue down you can see shapes
humanoid shapes locked behind bars of all shapes
and sizes As you begin to pass one on the right
you watch as a figure lurches up to the bars
pushes up to the edge and what faint bit of red
light you can see illuminating a face that looks
scarred by a large heavy clawmark down one side
the eye glued shut from the healing process You
see this toothy rotten grin underneath as a nasty
smell of breath emanates from its heavy breathing
and as you pass by it says Hey Are you going
to come back are you Where are you going Where
are you going Come back And you walk past One
of the guards takes their shortsword and clangs it
across the metal and goes Keep back keep back
 To what name
 Schuster Okay You listen Make a
perception check
 Okay You listen out and you hear a few
voices chuckle and some shifting of people that
are now making their way to the front of the cell
to see what this arriving group of strangers is
but nothing out of the expected ordinary reacting
to that name
 A few other figures push their way to the
face and you can see men and women you can see
decrepit halfelves that look poorly nourished
You can see humans that look like theyve smeared
themselves with their own foul excrement You can
see a whole nature of people that are in the
process of dealing with being locked down here in
the subterranean basement level of this prison
And then at the end you come to what looks to be
an iron door that is currently sealed shut with
what looks to be rung after rung after rung of
chains pulled through across bars locked with
three padlocks
 The main guard sitting there goes Aye it
is He pulls out a ring of keys
 When we sealed it
 About a little over two years ago
 It leads down splits in the middle and
has two more sets of cells in the back side
 I dont know
 Damn right
 With that one latch and one lock comes
free pulls it off and hands it to the guard
 Second lock comes free
 You take a moment to concentrate on it
 All right So with that the bucket of tar
is now being held aloft from the floating
spectral Mage Hand that Nott is controlling
 Correct
 Correct
 Correct
 All right So being careful not to destroy
the bucket itself which while it is made of
metal youre uncertain of its structural
integrity but you do focus on a little slow burn
of this flame controlling the Fire Bolt to be a
gradual burn As you do you watch as the metal
iron of the bottom of this bucket begin to heat to
a dull orange into a brighter orange And after a
few moments of concentrating you can see a faint
 The tar seems to be heating and to a
fairly more liquidy consistency than its rather
cold and more solid form that you found it in
  At which point the third lock comes
off The guards begin pulling the chains through
the various loops until eventually the door is
exposed  opens And on the inside
theres a few steps that descend into what looks
to be a double door beyond that One of the doors
is partially opened and it is darkness with a
faint red glow beyond that
 Theres probably some light but it
wouldnt hurt to bring your own especially for
that one And points to Caleb
 So as Fjord touches the front of his chest
armor you watch as the cold air solidifies
getting this mist and bits of ice crystal
protruding from his leather armor
 You got it
 As all of you are ushered past the metal
door the guards all gather on the opposite side
and the lead guard of the unit goes Very well
May the Platinum Dragon guide you Closes the
door and you hear the chains on the opposite side
being locked as you all turn back looking down
the six or seven feet of descending stairs before
it levels into the double doors partially opened
and the darkness beyond And thats where were
going to take a quick break
 Well were going to dive into that just
because if we go into a battle it might take a
little while Well take the break now before
that and then we can dive into it immediately as
we return
 Perfect Shiny blade balls are easy to talk
to
 All righty guys So well be back here in
a few minutes were going to take a five or ten
minute break to get ourselves comfy  food
water and other releases of functions
 And well see you guys here in just a
moment so hang tight in the chat if you want to
Well have a couple of fun videos to watch and
once again if you havent seen the Kickstarter of
these awesome minis you can go to critrolecom
for all that information They have the links
there to the Kickstarter The guys at Steamforged
have done an amazing job and we hope you like
them All right well see you here in a few
minutes

 And welcome back Wow

 Indeed So welcome back Coming back into
the game You have all descended down and reached
the double doors partially open and stepped
quietly into the interior chamber of this sealed
portion of the Gearhold Prison There is what
looks like a faint flicker of those same
emberlight torches that give off faint bits of
red glow but a number the walls seem to have been
damaged Actually as you step inside you get a
quick look The doors that are behind you and the
walls around you are scraped and gashed from
hundreds and hundreds of blade marks It looks
like whatever in here has spent a lot of time
grinding around and looking of a means of escape
or patrolling with its blades out over and over
again Parts of the walls have fallen in a bit and
there is rubble in areas where its starting to
erode away the interior of this sealed chamber
along the ground all you see are hundreds and
hundreds of bladelike grooves in the stone
 Without your massive intelligence roll you
werent able to discern that information unfortunately
 That is a ndlevel spell if I recall
 Both of them
 Okay
 Over here
 All right It is a set of prison bars There
is a gate that is currently locked The bars
themselves once again you can see rows and rows
of gashes and scrapes across the metal Theyre
bowed in a bit from impacts repeatedly Its
slightly bent inward You can attempt to pick a
lock if youd like
 Go ahead and roll Thats proficiency bonus
plus dexterity
 A   Its not triggering the
lock These are not easy locks to get through
Theyre designed to hold prisoners unfortunately
so theyre fairly hardy locks You spend a while
with it and are unable to hit those tumblers It
looks like its not going to open Make a
perception check as youre looking through the
bars
 All right
 Not with that perception roll no You see
bits of rock You see some cloth on the ground thats it
 Yasha you have the torch right No Caleb
has the torch
 Start scooting this way
 Yeah These are the painted prototypes to
give you a little bit of a glance of what these
will look like There are a few changes for the
final designs of course but these will give you
an idea All righty Theres Molly on that side
Caleb as you hold the torch up at the bars and
look through make a perception check with
advantage As youre following off Notts lead and
its small chamber you can make out quite a bit
of detail
 Good Glancing inside you see that whatever
scrape marks that mar the interior of this main
chamber there are none within this cell Whatever
this creature this Gearkeeper construct is it
did not manage to breach these gates However on
the opposite side you see three different bed
setups for prisoners Some that seem either they
were trying to claw their way out or the impact
of slamming on the other walls caused bits of it
to fall in and collapse There are piles of stone
and fallen earth on the other side You see three
skeletons They look like theyve been decomposing
for quite some time Probably prisoners that
couldnt escape and had no other way out
 Make a perception check
 Your dark vision is  feet correct You can
just make out the details of another interior
chamber Looking within portions of the walls
inside are also equally scraped apart Edges of
the fine wellset stonework have been marred with
repeated gashes all over It looks like beyond
that there was another prison cell but those bars
have been breached as they are currently bent
gnarled and twisted and pulled out of place The
cell beyond it appears to be open
 Anybody else moving anywhere
 The door is open but there are bars on
this
 Yes and its partially bent inward from the
impact It looks like it sustained quite a bit of
brunt force to it over time
disadvantage but the rest of us could take pot
shots at it from in here
 Make an intelligence check Caleb if you
dont mind
  Okay You were referring I believe to
the spell Arcane Lock right
 Yep It can still be forced open its just
a higher DC to do so Its possible but it makes
it a much harder door to break through
 You have a valid point to what youre
saying yes
 Go for it Make a perception check
 Seven Unfortunately even with your
darkvision its hard to look past that way You
can see another chamber At your current vantage
point its a little bit out of the way It looks
like theres not enough information Youd have to
get a little closer to make out the details
 There are some piles of rubble and portions
of the walls that have collapsed inwards
 So what are you guys doing
 Yasha where are you moving to
 Right here
 Beau youre moving over here as well
 Its going to be hard to hide and climb it
as well We can do about there as good as we can get there
 Molly are you staying there
 She doesnt yet
 So where are you sending Frumpkin
 Moving back in the corner with Beau and
Yasha Right about there well say
 You begin to focus and Frumpkin heads to the
right side of the fork into the chamber youve
already looked into towards the open cell doors
that are currently pried off that archway As
Frumpkin glances past make a stealth check for
Frumpkin
 Thats okay
 Rolled a  Okay
LIAM Yeah Lets go with that
 All right Frumpkin glances inside this
busted cell and sees what Im using as an
interpretation of a large spherical metal object
thats about eight feet diameter on any side It
looks like a series of overlapping metal plates
that look clustered together at odd angles
Elements of it look scraped and dented It looks
like its been doing some serious damage to it
over time As it sits there resting and Frumpkin
approaches you watch one of the tiny little metal
plates  open a lens pokes out towards
Frumpkin withdraws back in The plate closes and
about six of these long bladelike spider legs
stick out of it as it pulls back and begins to
roll forward at a very extreme pace
 It rolls forward Frumpkin just manages to
bamf out of this dimension as the object slams
into the opposite wall You guys feel the entire
chamber suddenly  from the impact and you
hear this scraping of metal in the distance
 It rolls across the way and disappears into
the other chamber
 Go ahead and make a stealth check please
 Nott where do you want to go
 Here
 You do hear the same object shifting on the
other side
  Okay
 Nott as youre there at the edge and
Beaus there You glance in now that you guys are
close enough you can see shifting in there You
pay attention and you can see this other chamber
is open with another cell off to the side It
slams into that door spins around and one of the
lenses peeks around the corner right at where Beau
had just moved into the far corner
 Wheres Fjord going Because were about to
go into combat
 Jester can back up there
 I need all of you to roll initiative
 You throw the ball bearings out clattering
As that happens the legs which are still out
rear backward and they retract as it runs itself
rolling forward in your direction ricocheting off
that wall The ball bearings as it grinds across
the bottom get fired off like small impact
bullets from the grinding of the metal plates and
the force of it hitting I need both Nott and Beau
to make dexterity saving throws
 
 Not with advantage Just a single roll
 You guys both manage to just duck out of the
way they dont seem to hit you Its only a
handful of them that upon the impact of it hitting
stone and being pressured beneath they shoot off
in your direction
 Initiative rolls guys Roll for yourself
Beau and then roll for Jester and Fjord as well
  to 
  to  anybody  to 
  to ten
 All right Ten to five
 Caleb and Jester are in the same
 Seven got it Top of the round as you see
it come riding and curve around the corner and
slam into that wall the stone bends inward even
further and bits of the masonry flake and fall off
to the ground clattering and small bits of stone
It turns and you can see now the six spiderlike
blade legs sticking out of it Six more shoot out
of the top of it and all begin whirling around
and begin spinning There amongst this chaos you
see the lens sitting right there just barely
peeking through its armored shell Yasha youre
up first
 All righty
  You just barely get into its
range with your barbarian speed You rush in
anger on your face You draw your Magicians Judge
blade in the air
  unfortunately does not hit Your blade
scrapes across its armored exterior not finding
purchase in any of its innards
 The first attack that hits
 Correct
 Yeah you get that every round
  hits Roll damage
 You roll d for the weapon d for the
Divine Fury Oh no its additional half your level
 d plus three right
  and then your rage damage which is
two
 Well no its the first attack that hit
Thats what Im saying You get Divine Fury for
this hit because your first one hit this one does
get it
 Okay With that
 The first strikes off The second one you
bring down The blade carves down and one of its
metal arms bends off to the side The blade digs
into the gears Yashas blade finds its way in
Sparks go streaking off and the blade gets
jettisoned off You have to hold it before it gets
shot off the side of it the clockwork pushing it
out of its innards The armor plate clicks over
and guards its space
 It looks like its bent back a bit That
ends Yashas turn Fjord is up next
 The robit is ahexed
 You have a concentration on Fjord for this
 Like a fromthehipshotgun I like it
 Thats two shots Fire twice
 Seven plus eight  You fire the blast
hits and disperses against the armor It does not hit
   does hit Roll a d plus four plus
another d for Hex Not a d plus four damage to
whatever you roll on the d
 The second one does manage to pierce some of
its armor Within the interior of it theres a
flash of green on the inside You see it curl
around from the interior looking like cracks in
the armor are suddenly glowing and then no more
That finishes Fjords action and bonus action
 Is Fjord going to stay where he is
 Beau doesnt go yet because its now the
Gearkeepers turn
 Thats okay
 Thats all right
 Beginning of its turn its going to attempt
to roll over Yasha to go into the chamber Yasha
you need to make an athletics or acrobatics
check
 Youre raging so you have advantage on your
acrobatics check
 No First off you suffer
 Seven points of piercing damage as it rolls
over and the blades kick into you
 It is halved An additional three points of
bludgeoning damage as you are crushed beneath its
weight and you are knocked prone
 It was seven before three So itll be ten
halved so you take five points of damage
 It does roll past here stopping at this
point Itd be about here I think As it spins in
this direction the things that drew its attention
originally which is Beau and Nott in that corner
Nott you do get an attack of opportunity with a
melee weapon if you have one but you
have your crossbow out
 So yeah you dont do much of an attack
there
 Roll an attack Improvised weapon for a
melee
  just hits
 You get a point of damage on it
 Your hand crossbow as you slam into it you
look back and it looks like some of the wood is
splintered somewhat Youre like Oh Its not
enough to the point where it looks like its not
going to function maybe but its going to need
some repairs
 Well there you go As it turns around the
front of it where the lens is the lens retracts
in The plates in front suddenly open leaving
this open black vacuous space like a mouth or a
gate opens in front You hear this very high
whirring winding sound You see sparks inside
and a blast of heated shrapnel shoots outward in a
 foot spray
 Against both of you right there
 I need you both to make a dexterity saving
throw please
 Success so you take half damage
 That is  points of piercing damage to you
Nott
 Correct
 Now you know about the reactions
 Of piercing damage and halved for you so
you take 
 Its shrapnel blast is done Thats the end
of its turn That brings us to Beau Youre up
 Over this way
 Yashas prone on the ground
 Oh so around here
 Youre moving into melee
 Got it
 Go for it
 Ten misses The first strike with your staff
just scrapes off of its armor no impact
 The second one you strike again This time
one of the blades swings outward and thankfully
the blade doesnt hit the staff to cut the wood
however it does the backhand impact it and
prevent the blow from actually striking its body
 Thats not fun
 You go and punch the armored sphere
 Go for it
 It just misses Well not so much a miss
You hit it but you go  Oh You
can feel that from the knuckles right to the funny
bone
 From there you have ten feet
 Okay Finishing Beaus turn that brings us
to Nott and Molly
 Its lens appears to be out currently just
surveying the scenario yes
 Ill say for the purposes of aiming on
this with your intention go ahead and make a d
attack roll adding your perception bonus
  Ill say for the purposes of that
because its not armor youre trying to strike
through its just trying to aim for a position
that will be enough The tar with a toss
 all across the lens You see the
sticky still warm thick tar spray onto it and
get inside the interior of its armor for the
moment The lens starts  and you
hear what previously was now that its close to
you you can hear theres hundreds and hundreds of
small clicks and winding sounds on the inside
Theres now a rapid  as the
lens is trying to find some sort of direction It
is currently blinded

 Technically you are ten feet from it
 The blades have a bit of reach so you are
technically in melee
 You can use your action to disengage yeah
Disengage generally is an action
 Which direction
 All right You can get there You can go one
more if you want to
 All right there you go You can still keep
it in your visual range but thats  feet back
Now you spin around with your crossbow not
suffering any attack of opportunity All right Molly
 You may yes Well you can try and
inspect
 At the moment it hasnt taken a lot of
damage and its hard to see if any
 The only plate thats open is the one that
has the lens visible but its really close to the
body and right now theres blades spinning in its
space
 At the moment not really Its still fresh
in battle and its armor plates are pretty much
protecting all of it
 Where are you going to attack its
construction
 Oh with the lollipop All righty Youre
going to be right there on top of the door
 All righty take your attacks
 Nice Make your damage on that and roll the
second attack Thats
  points of damage Nice
 Correct
  does not but first strike carves through
and some of the armor bends inward As you cut
through plates bend inward and have to try and
retract to protect but theyre locked in place
Youve actually bent them to the point where they
cannot reform this armored mesh Its trying to
correct itself but busted in place The second
strike as you come down one of the blades
catches and parries it off to the side No impact
on the second blow
 Go for it
  does not hit This is a tough mother You
go to strike a third time You do hit but it just
doesnt cut through The blade shakes a bit You
pull back cursing yourself
 For those questioning even though it is
blinded it lowers its attack because some people
are like Attacking things with blindness have
advantage Because it is nothing but a spinning
whirring of blades and technically it has
multiple forms of sight it is not granting
advantage on the attacks against it
 All righty You try and move this way
 All right youre hopping up this edge
 Okay so that will be probably over here
best you can for this
 You manage to scoot yourself up to that side
and climb away It does swing out towards you It
does have disadvantage on the attack because of
the blindness That will bring it to a  to hit
 You manage to duck out of the way
 That ends your turn there That brings us to
Caleb and Jester
 No it is surrounded Theres Beau to one
part of it its about ten feet from Yasha and
about  feet from Molly
 Strength save That is a  What is your
DC
 Five points of damage got it It is held in
place
 That it does That ends your turn Caleb
Are you going to stay back in the corner where you are
 You are backed up into the current corner
as far away as you can get That ends Calebs
turn Jesters up What are you guys doing with
Jester
 That was  to hit
 That does not hit The lollipop swings down
and then bounces down off the armor The Spiritual
Weapon is not able to penetrate its armored hide
Thats your bonus action Jester still has an action
  definitely hits Roll damage on that
 Yes and the next attack on it has
advantage
  points of damage Nice As the released
Guiding Bolt slams into the side of it the blast
of divine energy explodes Some of the plates dent
inward and now you see this glittering energy
thats entwining its body giving you a glimmer of
some of the weak points to help you hit where
itll hurt the most Does that finish Jesters
turn She going to stay where she is or is she
going to move
 Okay so she tries to move into the
doorway
 Yeah
 Sounds good So that finishes Jesters turn
Top of the round Yasha
 Thats half your movement so you still have
 feet of movement
 Right there You are now flanking with Beau
Your first attack has advantage anyway because of
the Guiding Bolt
 You cannot discern any sort of rear end or
exhaust port
 Youll find out Im sure
  hits Roll damage on that first strike
  points of damage Cutting through bits
and pieces of it Nice Thats your first strike
on it As you jam down grinding off some of the
metal plates pull away from it and once again
lock unable to push back into place Theres
small places where youre starting to buckle parts
of its exterior armor so its AC actually does go
down by one
 Thats your first strike You get a second
attack
 You do because youre currently flanking
with Beau
  does hit Roll damage
 Correct Just d plus five
  points of damage Nice Yasha busting it
out All right that finish your turn
 Oh because its restrained Right
 Good to know That finishes Yashas turn
Its now Fjords go
 Go for it Make two strikes with the
falchion First attack with advantage
 All right that hits The first attack
thats a d plus
 A d plus four plus Hex
 No
 Booming Blade is a cantrip that only gives
you one attack as part of the action
 Thats okay
 All right thats  damage
 Its been a long day I know Fjord comes up
holding the falchion hand swings down carving
through the shadows of the Hex helping the blade
dig in that much more You have a second attack
 Yep
  points of damage That hits again With
that with Fjord carving into it twice with the
blade each time the falchion is carving through
each section more and more armored pieces are
pushing inward Its not enough to lower its AC
but it is taking more and more damage Slowly
youre piercing its heavily protected exterior
 Fjord would have yeah
 Ten more feet
 One or two steps
 All right Still in melee
 Its a ten foot range That ends your turn
 All right That brings us to the Gatekeeper
construct The lens has retracted back into its
armor and you hear this sound  the lens
comes out and it has cleared the tar from its lens
 The lens retracts and pops out the back
side immediately scanning the source of whats
currently clutching it and its dirtdriven arcane
paw The blade arms on the top retract in and
instead these two heavy iron spears lock into
place and both go firing outward towards Caleb
 They have disadvantage because it is
restrained With disadvantage its going to be an
 to hit for the first one
 All right
 All righty Second one  and   plus
eight its going to be 
 The first one the shield  It
ricochets off and floats off in the background
spinning The second one however pierces through
the shield and hits you in the chest
 Thats going to be  points of piercing
damage
 And you are pinned to the wall It actually
pierced through your chest and is now holding you
into the stone Your movement is zero and you are
considered restrained against the wall
 You do So go ahead and make a constitution
check With the damage taken it has to be at
least a ten or higher
 No and with that the paw is broken
 No its gone Youve lost concentration on
the spell And it did recharge its shrapnel blast
 That being the case thats going to finish
its turn Its going to stay put Because the
blades now grind out again and begin whirring and
spinning around its orblike body That brings us
to Beau Beau at the top of your turn because
you are within five feet of it you automatically
take whirling blade damage by being in proximity
 That was yes
 Yes So at the top of your turn youll take
it as well Thats six points of slashing damage
to you Beau Now take your turn
 Fuck you Sam
 You do because youre flanking
 A four and a six
 Okay That dice is weird for that because
then you rolled the d twice
 All right So roll the second one
 For the second strike
 The first roll you had was a four on the
top so roll for your second die
 Just keeping it kosher
  hits yeah Go ahead and make your strike
with your staff
 Four points of damage
 So thats eight As your staff strikes
across it the wood of it while damaging doesnt
seem to be having as strong an impact as youd
hope against its armored form
 It seems to be resistant to something that
is not magical
 Sure Lets go ahead and Im pretty
sure
 Im so sorry
 By the rules as written because it mentions
the ki of the inside of the body there is no ki
but there is a magical core Ill say that when
you strike the body intending to stun it while
youre not affecting the ki of a soul the ki that
youre expending might interfere with its central
energy core So it has to make a constitution
saving throw
 Thats going to be a  Whats the DC
 Its a  plus five Im sorry
 You have another attack
 You do
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage for
that Second strike with your staff
 All right six
 It takes five points of damage as the second
strike is still somewhat deflected by the
armor of its body
 You can You spend a ki point Since weve
changed or errataed it it does not make a saving
throw You just get to learn
 At level six you get to learn two things
 The lowest saving throw ability it has would
be charisma

 Not against some spells
 Okay go for it
 Yep
 That hits
 Five damage reduced to two This time you
hit with your fists Again it scrapes through the
armor and youre bleeding at the knuckles from
the impact Its hard to break through its shell
 This is a rough fight for a monk at level
five unfortunately
 That finish your turn Beau
 Okay that finishes Beaus turn Nott and
Molly youre up
 Go for it
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 It is
 Eight points of damage reduce that in half
because its a nonmagical source Thats four
points of piercing to it
 It gets stuck in some of the gears You see
some sparks from the inside but it doesnt fully
pierce its shell
 Go for it That is a magical bolt
 The bolt doesnt impact It just glides off
the armor It lands somewhere in the distance You
dont know if its retrievable or not yet
 Molly youre up
 All right you move in Go for it
 First strike it dodges it moves out of the
way The second strike actually makes an impact
so roll for that
  points of damage all righty Carves
through with the second strike
 This is your offhand so its not a magical
weapon
 Correct so the extra rite damage is
magical but the actual blade will be halved
 So roll the d for your blade
 Five reduced to two So two damage plus
this doubled Well no sorry the two is doubled
because it was a crit So it would have been four
plus three which is seven
 Sure its five damage
 So  points of damage Now the armor is
reduced to  as youre carving away at its
armored shell Its starting to look pretty hurt
You see it shifting rapidly trying to figure out
its situation and tactically maneuver best it
can
 If you back all the way up to here you can
Or all the way up to the top
 At the moment no
 Okay
 Sure
 Caleb and Jester youre up next Caleb
youre currently pinned to the wall Youre muted
also I cant hear you
 Yasha does
 Yes Yasha Fjord and then the thing
 As the paw reaches out once more to grab
it that is a   plus five Sorry man
Youre still maintaining concentration but it did
not seem to grasp it at this moment All right
that ends Calebs turn Jesters up
 Okay so step back through the door a little
bit there What level
 So a d plus four to Caleb
 Caleb you heal seven points Thats a bonus
action from Jester Whats next You can only use
a cantrip since youve cast a bonus action spell
 Spiritual Weapon is a bonus action spell
Youve already used the Healing Word unfortunately
 It doesnt work that way
 No
 Or a cantrip
 But Calebs healed a little bit
 Constitution saving throw
 Wisdom to Toll the Dead
 It is wisdom you are right So that would
put it at a  Because it has no wisdom modifier
  so it takes the damage Go ahead and
roll
 Youre level five so it technically
 Its a thlevel character so its
 Not bad for a cantrip
 Its not too bad All right thats going
to finish Jesters turn Does she want to move
 Back into the door You got it Jester is
just on the side there All right finishes
Jesters go Yasha youre up
 At the top of your turn you take blade
damage because youre in proximity to it Thats
ten You take ten points of piercing damage So
reduced to five
 There are a couple of pockets where you can
see inside of it but you dont see the power
source Its risky
 So youre just taking a strike with it You
have advantage because youre flanked with Beau
 Some fights arent great for every class
Im sorry
  hits Roll damage
 Yep  AC
  points Carving past with the blade You
have a second strike if youd like
 Yeah it is because youre flanking
 Yeah that hits Roll damage again
  points of damage in one round Yasha
doesnt mess around That finishes your turn
 Fjords up
 Correct you can do that
 So an additional three damage per strike
 Yeah but now you know
 No Youre not flanking with anybody
 So first attack with the falchion
 Thats two attacks there
 Yeah both will hit so roll damage on each
So a d plus
 d plus seven on each attack plus a d on
each So roll that
 Nice Starting to look pretty rough now as
parts of it are breaking down a bit Its shaking
and you see little sparks on the inside as gears
are starting to connect where theyre not supposed
to and grind against each other That finish
Fjords turn
 Five feet or ten
 One more and itll take an attack of
opportunity Up to you
 Technically if he takes it
 No he can move farther than that
 Okay its not going to take an attack of
opportunity Its currently focused on everything
else around it
 That finishes Fjords turn
 This entity is going to attempt to shift
back this way Which means Beau and Molly both get
attacks of opportunity against it
 You do not because its still in melee with
you
 No because its moved out of that range
  hits so roll damage It does not move
  reduced to six got it
 Nope he gets stuck there The bane of all
GMs everywhere
 No he did not technically move out of
its sticky Its one of those weird things where
he doesnt technically move beyond the range but
he tries to
 Ill let you have it sure
 You have no advantage
 Currently no You would need something
right there in that corner to flank
 That hits Roll damage
 It angrily is going to open to do its
shrapnel blast
 It was that powerful I need Molly Beau
Fjord and Caleb and technically Jester as
well
 She didnt close the door there She stepped
into the space to maintain eye contact
 Dex save please
 Thats a success
 That is a failure
 Success Oh youre not there Nott
 Fjord and Jester if you could
 Okay so everyone saves except for Fjord
Sorry Jester  points of piercing damage
halved to be  points of piercing damage to
everybody
 You rolled a
 No you do not so you take the full 
points of piercing damage
 No shit
 And still pinned Jester took a full 
 She rolled low for her dexterity check 
points of damage
 Thats its action It is locked in place and
it cant move Its speed is zero frustratingly
Caleb I need you to make another concentration
check please from the damage you took
 I thought your other cat hand
 It failed but can you still try it for
every turn after or is it a onetime cast thing
 But youve recast it
 Right but when you create it in space it
stays there
 Yeah and then as an action you can cause it
to try and do things
 Make a concentration check to see if you
maintain the spell
 Higher than a ten
 All right you succeed You maintain
concentration That finishes your turn Beau
youre up first
 You dont have to roll You take damage from
proximity to it so you automatically fail a death
saving throw from the blades carving into your
nowunconscious body nearby
 Yeah whatever you rolled on your death
saving throw
 Yeah so thats a failure and a success
That brings us to Nott and Molly
 Thatll do Roll damage with sneak attack
 Five points of piercing damage on the first
strike Do you want to bonus action attack as well
  Go ahead Thats d plus
 Halved to three all righty Sparks are
flying Its starting to shake Molly top of your
turn the swirling blades spin around and you take
eight points of slashing damage Its your turn
 At the moment for you if you move over
Beaus body Its a tough call I mean Ill let
you do it if you want to Youll have to be
standing over her unconscious body
 Probably not
 Its up to you
 Go for it Take those shots Molly
 That hits
  points of damage all righty Next
strike
 Yep roll damage on this one
 Ten points of damage How do you want to do
this The blades are spinning grinding around
 The edges of the armor scrape against your
flesh pushing and cutting past skin causing
blood to drip down your arm but this is a natural
state for you As the arm pushes into the center
theres a flash of blue light and the interior of
its armored shell  Its
like a glow on the inside of a cracked dark orb
as all the individual sections where the plate
armors meet suddenly glow with a bright vibrant
bluewhite light and then go dark and the whole
metal object hits the ground All the legs go
limp and it rolls a little bit to one side now
inert and no longer functioning as a construct
 The negaSnitch
 I love it
 Well see how it fares
 All righty You all take a moment Beau is
bleeding out
 Jester runs up
 Yasha puts her foot up on the wall and with
one big yank pulls it out of your torso Caleb
It was about two inches from the side of your body
and thrust through your abdomen You begin to
bleed but Jester comes over and helps close up
that wound before you bleed out too much further
 Glancing into the chamber that is another
closed gate that is bent inward from the repeated
slamming of this centurion trying to make its way
in Looking past the inside you see four
decomposed bodies
 Make an attempt to do so
 These prison locks are a pain in the butt
You havent encountered something quite so heavily
fortified as these cells
 Okay make a strength check
 No you have to force it
 It is not budging
 You go over see where Molly has failed and
you go and try to fill that void Make a strength check
 Okay Its a little late but Ill allow it
sure
 Why not Go for it
  okay As Yasha comes forward and slams
her foot into it it jostles the lock just enough
for you to slip past the tumblers and with a
 it opens a few inches on the inside The
bottom of it is scraping against the stonework
the way its been bashed and bent has actually
forced it out of the frame of the door and its
going to take a bit more force to push it open
enough to move inside but you manage to do so
 Okay
 Make an investigation check
 How many ball bearings did you throw out
 Your entire bag
 Okay You get your pouch back and you manage
to scoop up you have well say  ball bearings
  Most of which because its such a
ridiculous item
 Okay
 Sure so you make your way to the opposite
end
 Make an investigation check
 You find at first you think its dried
compost but you eventually realize no its just
very old human excrement
 You found prison poop
 Yes Yasha you head off to the other side
where the gate is open and as you go inside you
can see the interior of this chamber is as scraped
up as the rest of them from where this sentry was
attempting to scan and break out On the inside
make an investigation check First time for you
  okay Looking around on the inside you
take a glance and there are these little pieces
of things everywhere some hard some soft and
you start pulling it up and you notice that a lot
of these are tiny torn slivers of blanket or sheet
or pillow and the other hard pieces are tiny
shards of bone Whatever prisoners who were in
here who could not keep this at bay their remains
have been time and time again ground battered
and destroyed by this creature as it ran through
It has torn apart their bedding and their bodies
but beyond that nothing else of interest
 Fjord pats you on the shoulder next to you
and goes Hey I just wanted to let you know I
appreciate what you did taking the brunt of it
because it didnt even hurt me
 And thats because of you
 I know All righty so what else are you
guys doing
 Okay While Calebs taking a moment to
finish his short rest you begin to peer inside
and pull back some of the loosened armor plates
Now that the machine is open theres not tension
holding it together and you see that each of
these armored plates on the inside are attached
to its own armlike pole Once it collapsed all
the armor plates went limp and fell open Its a
tensionheld bit of armor that it could expand
and push out different areas to leave openings and
then retract again Its a pretty ingenious
design and you can see why Tinkertop is a
talented man though flawed sometimes in his
designs This is pretty revolutionary
 Similar to that I guess you could say
Looking inside its hundreds of these little
poles and gears and little servos and a lot of
them are ground bent and damaged from the impact
that you left inside There in the center you see
a cracked open and partially destroyed bluish
crystal sphere That was where your final blow
impacted to destroy it
 Its yanking and bending pieces pulling
them out and  On the inside with the
damage youve done its not too hard to pry a few
off but you manage to get to it and there is the
cracked and shattered crystal core
 Thats just part of the miniature That was
my representation for it I did not have a mini of
a spherical ball made of armor Im sorry thats
the best I could do for size and intimidation
Ive been very busy didnt have time to make an
entire mini of a tiny spherical metal ball covered
in blades
 Sorry no Its fine
 You do a scan of Detect Magic through the
room over the next  minutes or so You do a
thorough pass around Nothing magical catches your
attention Most of the interior here is
Actually no thats not true Very faint magical
auras from two ember light torches that are on the
wall That faint red light that youve seen is
essentially a very low light Everburning torch
 You pick yourselves up and make your way
back to the heavy metal door On this side you
can see the heavy scraping across it as this ball
has also been pushing repeatedly into this one
exit point As you approach it is still closed
and presumably locked
 You hear some shifting behind it and
eventually hear the familiar grinding of chains
against metal  It opens slightly and
the guards peer out You alive
 Go check it out A few of the gnomish
guards push past and head down Another one of the
gnomish guards goes Well fucking A Is it
done The other gnomes rush past him and say
Sure enough They killed the thing Hes like
Oh all right Ill lead you back to our boss
Come on follow me
 Fireman carries you
 Make an insight check
 Okay Go ahead and roll for that
 Five
 Make an investigation check as you glance
around the space
 Because its a small space you do manage to
recover it so you get one bolt back It did not trigger
 If it hits an intended target possibly or
something hard enough You rolled low enough where
it didnt seem to truly impact
 You guys slowly make your way guided back
by the various guards of the Gearhold Prison to
the office of the Wardenhelm where both Rissa and
her father are waiting As they walk in you
glance over and can see Cleff Hes like So
howd it go Any luck with the thing Oh you
broke it
 Im simultaneously impressed and kind of
sad but impressed mostly
 Its more for when its raining I didnt
think it would be for tar but good to know He
takes out the note in his little pad
 At this point you see turning in the office
vicinity Wardenhelm Poppin turns and goes It
appears my guards say you are successful in this
That is very good I am impressed What is your
names if I might be of curious
 The Mighty Nein All right Good to know
that The Mighty Nein can be relied upon in such
situations Are you staying in town for quite a
while
 Right While you were down there I got
approval for about  gold from the Starosta for
payment I hope that is enough
 I am curious as to what you are referring
to
 Oh Of course great deal Ooh sternum
its a bit pain Go ahead and make a persuasion
check with advantage
 A six
 Why you keep leading these social
encounters
 Well you got a talker but thats okay He
takes a keen look at you goes over and starts
thumbing through papers Goes through his books
picks one and goes Schuster Schuster
Schuster All right I found the report here He
turns the page That looks like they were
arrested for false idol worship That is not a
minor offense
 The Schusters are still to serve a twoyear
sentence both of them To pay the amount to bail
them out would be at this point about  gold
With the  that were offered that would put you
at a  bail amount should you wish to indeed pay
for these very important friends of yours
 And they will because its still
technically commissioned originally by the prison
so we own the rights to its carcass However the
moment of negotiation is over This is my price as
it stands Either you receive the  and walk
away or you can continue to pay the bail and they
will be released That is up to you
  gold
 Thats true
MARISHA Fjord says You know what To keep them
out of that orphanage
 Look at that Its beautiful
 At this point he
 Its true
 He accepts the coin shouts out to he
says Micahl And this female halfling comes
rushing in He says I would like for you to
write a writ for me of success in clearing the
lower regions of the prison under the watchful eye
of the Wardenhelm Poppin Drokrusher I thank you
And also could we please have sent up immediately
a he leans forward Gilda and Wallace Schuster
They are on the second level in cell B They
have had their bail paid The halfling rushes
off some of the guards leave with her and about
 or so minutes later you hear the footsteps
return and there you see this couple They pull
forward dirty sallow not very wellfed but
alive and they both look bewildered The man
whos got a thick graying brown scruff and the
hair a bit shaken from his form he glances up at
the rest of you I dont understand whats happening
 The woman looks over She has this long
curled and tangled brownishred hair She goes
Is this true Were free
 With that you guide the now
nolongerprisoners outside of the Gearhold
Prison and as the small door opens to lead them
out into the late afternoon air the sunlight hits
them And you see them blink and wince and then
look up and smile as this is probably the first
sunlight theyve seen in six months You can see a
bit of glimmer as tears begin to form at the edge
of their eyes and the two the couple look at
each other and smile and hold each other and
look back at the group of you and say Thank you
but why
 Are they all right Where are they
 They look at you and look both frightened
by the words you say and then equally frightened
by the creature they now realize that is saying
it and go Right right
 Thank you
 Thank you very much Can we go to our
children please
 With that you guys all make your way back
up the switchback path to the Idleworks Shelf
just as the sun begins to hit the mountains the
skies turning to the oranges and reds of the
coming sunset At this point the people of the
city begin to rise in energy once more as the
whistles of a days work come to a close The city
beings to liven up once more into an air of
celebration music blasting around you on all
sides
 As you guys push through the streets now
the celebration expanding and exploding throughout
the vicinity your stilllingering hangovers from
the night before mixed with your physically
damaged selves make you less jovial in this
space Eventually you make your way to the back to
the location of the previously boardedup butcher
shop It appears to be left alone closed locked
and as you left it
 
 You hear some shuffling and the door opens
Austin and Gail look past and open the door As
soon as Gail can say Youre back they look
and you can see their parents right there smile
back at them With that they rush out Gail and
Austin and wrap their arms around their mother
and father Behind them skittering Layla and
Jude look past and they run up as well and hold
them Now this family unit of six all brought
together again as filthy as they may be in their
current garb and lifestyle hold themselves
amongst the glowing of distant fireworks going
off an unknowing celebration that the city holds
for this family Behind you see Kiri shuffle out
see whats happening then also come forward and
put her arms around the family and looks back at
you with a smile  Yes I am a good
girl
 Kiri steps away from the group looks at the
rest of you takes the dagger out steps forward
and goes  The Mighty Nein
  Okay
  Ja
 At this point theyre barely paying
attention They look back and say
Im sorry what
 Fjord steps in next to you as well and
goes Look no children should be without their
parents and were happy to have brought you back
together Be more careful Make sure that if you
do anything that could put your kids at risk
dont He looks over and defers back to you Caleb
 The parents look at each other and down at
the kids The little girl Layla with her curled
red hair goes Does this mean she can stay and
looks over at Kiri Kiri looks between them and
you and looks temporarily conflicted and
confused but you can see a bit of understanding
wash over Kiri reaches over and takes from her
pocket the dagger steps forward and turns it
around handle forward Holds it out
  Yes I am very sweet She
reaches down and pulls out the music box Slowly
opens it after winding it

  Shes a pretty good egg
Looks up at Caleb and rushes forward and gives a
big warm hug
 She accepts it wideeyed I dont know
what to say
 She steps back and they look like theyre
in shock still from these strangers that have come
to their aid so heavily Kiri pulls back and looks
to you  Dont eat humans okay
 Jester you see her arms twisted up and the
eyes filled with water and she goes Oh Were
going to come back right
 She gives a big hug and goes Kiri youre
going to be so beautiful as you grow up and this
family is going to take care of you and is going
to be your new mother and father and youll have
this whole family here for you Remember that no
matter whats happening and what you are doing
the Traveler is always looking over you and we
are always always thinking of you with love
Jester turns around and you can see the tears
welling up in her eyes
 She takes you in there Fjord steps forward
and ruffles the feathers on the head and says
Youre always a member Maybe one day youll be
able to come back and use that dagger for
something thats alive Kiri turns back and looks
to you  Yeza was his name
 She gives you a hug
 Looks to Molly and gives this distant
stare
  Take care of them Looks to
you and comes up and cuddles up against your
chest where she had slept the night before and

 The feathers fluff up a bit
  Okay
 Kiri turns back and steps beside the kids
The family looks out and goes If theres ever
the opportunity to pay this back or forward we
will Thank you
 More fireworks go off and the whole family
looks up again and theres a moment where the
family as one single unit pulling Kiri into it
Gilda looks at them all and says Its been a
long time since I felt the need to celebrate How
about we all wash up and go out and take you for
flowers The kids brighten up excited and Kiri
looks up happily and curiously looks back They
all shuffle into the house The last look
as Kiri looks back over her shoulder
 I am Kiri The door closes
 Fjord as youre walking along back to your
inn goes Now I know yall did this because I
asked you to and you werent sure if you wanted
to I want you to know thats appreciated You
went out on a limb for me and these kids Ill
remember that Anyway come on As you guys make
your way back to a more solemn evening the
celebration is wild The Blushing Tankard Tavern
is in the same crazy energy and music you possibly
can expect but you are too exhausted emotionally
and physically You get a drink find your way
back to your room and crash out hard
 Long rest to you all The next morning you
come to consciousness your first morning not
hungover for a lot of you here in the city of
Hupperdook Now the city is yours to make your
final business with
 Well you havent gotten back to Tinkertop
for your half of the deal
 As you hold it up it goes 
 All right You get another set of ten
 I think it was two copper
 Thats amazing Awesome As thats
happening you guys have reached the exterior of
the Tinkertop Inventions shop
 Highquality provisions for the rest of the
trip
 If you drop a solid two gold
 You have good road meals thatll last
 Oh for the whole group For the whole
group put five gold down and Id say you guys
have some of the finest fucking food you could
have on the road going north That is good eating
 On the outskirts of the Tinkertop Inventions
shack you make your way on the inside and you
see in the process of feverishly sketching out
designs Cleff Tinkertop barely look up from his
page Oh Hello good to see you all again Thank
you Thank you for helping with that I think
based on some of these new designs Im coming
forward they might be interested in a new
version Perhaps a new design Perhaps an update
if you will based on the notes you gave me so
heres to hoping
 Can I help you with anything
 Ha ha Right sorry I forgot entirely
Ill be right back He goes back and rummages and
pulls out the fantastic previously displayed
Tinkertop Boltblaster  and goes Thank you
for your help I hope it serves you well By the
way if theres any problems if you wouldnt mind
making notes and feel free to mail them off to me
so I can perhaps improve on the next iteration
 If you dont mind Thatd be fantastic
 Of course and thank you as well Wherever
youre off to safe travels
 I think something can be arranged Ill be
here
 Thats a very curious series of words
youve strung together but Ill keep an eye out for you
 Course
 Well if youre leaving you should say
bye Rissa Behind him Rissa sits up with her
goggles on She was in the back currently working
on something Goes Oh right youre off
already Youre leaving
 Oh well its been fun
 Do Thank you for showing me a good time
and for getting this old coot back to some sort of
interesting means of constructive work
 She goes Well I mean drinking by proxy
Ill certainly take that
 Well Next time Ill owe you a round
 Well be safe Take care And til the next
time As you guys exit you hear her say I
dont think this designs going to work Dad He
says No trust me And the door closes behind you
 At this point well no you slept through
the night and youve woken up the next morning so
its pushing close to midday
 Fjord musters the cart the horses
retrieves them from where they were stored during
your stay here
 Looks like it unless you guys have anything
else planned
 Yes
 Make a perception check as you make your
way through the bottom end of the city
  Glancing through there are two
crownsguard that walk by both gnomish One of
them appears to be carrying a heavy sword on the
back The other one does have some sort of strange
contraption like a firearm pistol at its side
 Make a sleight of hand check
 Up to you
 All right
 Sleight of hand so your proficiency
modifier plus your dex
 Well no sleight of hand is Im sorry no
its a sleight of hand check
  yeah My brain I was thinking of
unlocking It glides past over you The guards
none the wiser
 It is loaded with a single shot
 So you have a singleshot pistol with no
ammunition
 Yes
 All right With that
 In those final dark moments This campaign
goes really dark suddenly With that you guys
head out past the fences the artillery
construction ranges the plumes of smoke and
steam the dualshelved levels of the gnomish city
of Hupperdook with the people adventures that
you met and left behind and forge your way on
further up the Crispvale Roadway heading towards
the Glory Run Road that heads north towards
Nogvurot and the Shadycreek Run Heading on for
the next better half of the day you make a fair
amount of travel before the sun eventually sets
before you can reach the crossroads Eventually
having to pull off to the side of the road to make
camp for the first night there You head off your
general curious range there you set up a small
camp Whos taking first watch
 Okay Nott and Caleb if you wouldnt mind
rolling a perception check with advantage or both
of you roll it individually
 No he rolled and now you
 All right You guys take your first watch
Nothing Though youre not paying much attention
nothing seems to transpire during that first watch
period You finish it without issue The second
watch come up Fjord goes ahead and says Ill
take it
 Youll join as well Yasha
 All right You guys take your second watch
Fjord and Yasha are currently situated there Two
of you are up Its now pushing past maybe one or
two in the morning The fire is burned low to
embers at this point and youre both staying
close for heat Fjords sitting there looking and
goes Im kind of proud of all this you know
 Yeah A lot of these folks have surprised
me A little voice goes like  Some
people are trying to sleep
 But Im awake now Fjord goes like Lets
take a walk Fjord stands up Jester stands up
and the three of you step away for a minute Fjord
looks up at the stars and goes Dreamsve been
weird For all the visions the darkness out
there its good to know that somehow maybe were
all putting a little bit of light in there too
 Who knows Maybe well find ourselves a
path somewhere along the coast in the long run
Could show you some of my hometown Maybe some of
yours but maybe not quite as well put together
Jester interjects at this point and goes Well
if we do go back I could show you if it is safe
depending on what my mom says the places where I
grew up the beautiful shorelines Have you been
to the Menagerie Coast before
 Oh it is so beautiful It would be
incredible
 Her mouth isnt making noise You go to
talk No sound comes out of it either Theres a
look of confusion amongst the three of you I need
you to make a wisdom saving throw Yasha
What did you roll
 In that moment of panic you go to reach for
your weapon and suddenly your muscles seize up
and your body is unable to move Your eyes glance
back at Fjord who seems to be in the same
position The falchion apparates in his hand but
he is unable to move Jester is the only one who
is like As she turns to run for the group and
impacts the chest of a dark humanoid figure whos
standing there who grabs and holds her in place
Four other dark figures emerge from the shadows
around and grab and immediately put their arms
around you You try and resist from the spell In
fact make another wisdom saving throw
 Fjord maintains it but all this in absolute
silence There is no sound just shadows and
starlight As youre now being grappled by two
men the spell breaks from you However theyre
still holding you As you feel a gag pulled over
your mouth from one of them the other one begins
to throw rope around you Youre looking over the
side and you can see another gag showed into
Fjords mouth Manacles are being shoved onto his
arms and legs Hes unable to move Jester tries
to break free off the opposite not with a
natural seven Shes kicking and screaming but
there is no sound coming out and as shes pushed
down another figure comes up and throws shackles
onto her arms behind her and her legs Shes
yelling and yelling and a gag is pulled over her
mouth What are you doing
 Theres two people that are now coming to
grapple you
 All right You pull your weapon Make an
attack if you want
  hits Roll damage on that
  damage Oof You have a second attack if
you like
 Your first one impacts one guy and theres a
splash of blood silent Once again no sound
here The second one swings wide and the other guy
captures it He grabs your arm and pulls you in
Hes going to make an athletics check against you
Make an athletics or acrobatics check to try and
not be grappled
 Thats not going to make it He grapples and
holds you in place The other one takes and slams
manacles onto your wrists and pulls it back
wrenching the blade from your grasp Your arms are
now locked behind you into these metal manacles
 You go ahead and scream Make a straight
wisdom check
 In that moment as you try and scream out
your vocal cords strained by the sheer force of
your voice no sound comes out Looking up in the
sky there isnt a single cloud in sight Probably
for the first time in weeks since youve been in
this side of Wildemount it is a clear night No
sign of clouds No sign of storm In that moment
as youre screaming out the gag gets put into
your mouth and tied behind your head You glance
over and you can see Jester being dragged Now the
manacles affixed to the back of her ankles and
shes being pulled through the grass Fjord a few
feet behind her Still unable to really make out
the shapes of these hooded figures that are
pulling them through and you are shoved to the
ground
 Your ankles are about to be manacled
 Make another athletics check
  all righty With that you manage to
kick free and they cant quite get ahold on it and
one figure steps forward shorter than the others
stout looking and goes Oh for the and his
voice dissipates as he gets closer I need you to
make another wisdom saving throw
 Youre still kicking and breaking free
Theyre going to try to restrain you once more
Roll one more athletics check
 No thats not going to do it As much as
you struggle right now youre by yourself Now it
looks like two figures holding you down and the
third one that is frustrated that you have
resisted a spell a second time They get the
manacles on the back of your legs Your arms are
held behind your ankles are now pulled up towards
where your hands are and you are face down in the
wet grass in the middle of the night as you feel
your body now being dragged by the chains
Dragged dragged Your mouth is filled with the
taste of the sweat thats poured down thats
soaked into the gag thats now forced in your
mouth Grass and grime and mud are grinding
against your face All you can see is the dark
shadow there and the bits of star and sky ahead
until eventually youre lifted upright right back
once more Immediately you can see a series of
wide carts large travel caravan carts that are
low set covered with piles of goods Looks like
sacks and a couple of crates fairly
sparselooking for travel caravan crates but what
you see travel up and down the roads all the time
There are three of them with horses to the front
of them You can see about eight other figures
around these carts As youre up held there with
your mouth gagged and your arms and legs bound
you look off to the side and you can see Fjord and
Jester also struggling and unable to find their
way about Jester begins to flex against it and
you can see her strong physique pushing against
it and she gets smacked upside the cheek by one
of the men that pulls her and holds her in place
You hear a voice speak up and say Hey look what
we found eh You see a dark figure step closer
to you Glancing up through the minimal light a
human man tall and brutish His head is
completely bald on top revealing a scarred and
tattooed design across one side that curls down
into his lightly leathered armored chest His
thick brow hangs over two cold uncaring eyes He
nods in approval to these three acquisitions that
you are revealing a number of golden teeth
between his cracked lips His muscular body is
mostly obscured by a cloak and hood beyond that
armor The thug goes Lorenzo your instincts are
sharp Looks like we found ourselves a sudden
bounty The heavy figure who hasnt spoken at
this point kneels down and grabs the chins of
each of you Grabs Jester who is now shaking
with anger and fear in her eyes looks both sides
of her face goes to Fjord and lifts the chin
comes to you and grabs
 The gag is right there so you 
Looks like this ones got some spirit too
 Our prospects are good with this find
Two divineblood and one halfbeast Im pleased
Toss them in with the others Well head back Our
cages are at capacity now He stands back up and
turns around and heads back to the carts as
youre all being thrown to your sides again and
being dragged through the wet grass and dirt over
rocks You can feel gashes being pulled across
your face and shoulders as youre being pulled
through the dirt Youre righted once more and two
more goons lift you up towards the back of this
mostly empty cart It seems just small piles and
boxes and then suddenly your vision shifts as if
youre being pulled through a curtain and these
carts are piled high with cages And the opened
one that the three of you are showed into clangs
behind you this five feet by five feet box As
the three of you are jammed into each other
uncomfortably you look about inside under what
looks to be a darkened tarp that covers the cages
Glancing out the side of your eye you can see in
the one next to you that there are other dark
humanoid figures quietly whimpering and not
moving You hear Heyup and the horses begin to
pick up speed as the creaking of wheels turning
get faster and the feel of the cart beginning to
move And thats where were going to finish
tonights session

 Its possible
 There were some struggle
 Its going to be interesting
 Love you guys
 Well she didnt take her haversack with her
when she parted with you guys

guys thank you so much for coming with us We
love you and is it Thursday yet Good night

 And welcome back
 So Welcome back Last we left off The
Mighty Nein were making their way north after
making a deal with the Gentleman in Zadash They
had completed the first of two tasks for him the
second one requiring them to make their way to the
northern city of Shadycreek Run outside of the
Empire to meet with a business operative of his
who had been busy with some other elements and
needed some help to reconnect about what their
business together was Along this journey you had
made a stop in the gnomish city of Hupperdook
where you discovered the workhardplayhard
gnomish society got all your money taken from
you got it returned to you as you found out the
thieves were the young children of a family the
parents of which had been arrested and had been
imprisoned for a while You went to the prison
helped destroy one of their longhaywire
guardians and paid off the rest of the fine for
those parents to set them free returning them to
their children and decided to leave your
temporary companion for a while Kiri with them
as a safer means of continuing her journey now
with her new family
With that you gathered your things found
yourself a better crossbow and began heading back
on the trail along the Crispvale Road and making
your way northward There you had set up camp for
the evening about a days travel outside of
Hupperdook and during the night while Yasha and
Fjord were taking their watch wakening Jester
with their conversation and the three of them
deciding to step away from the camp as not to wake
the rest of you they were Well they went missing
 We begin todays story as morning slowly
creeps over the distant mountains The cold
frosted dew on the tops of the nearby grasses
glistening like tiny crystals the bits of
sunlight begin to just break past the ridge The
sky previously clear the night before showing the
stars above now is matted with cloud cover and
small breaks that show the blue sky above The
cold weather is definitely shaking you awake as
you all begin to come to rubbing your eyes
Glancing about the cold atmosphere you come to
the hard dirt ground patch that you had cleared
out for your evenings rest your packs and tents
ready to be reassembled But its just the four
of you
 Make a perception check
 Looking about there is a faint mist that is
still burning off that clouds your vision far
enough to the point where you cant quite see some
elements of the mountain range you had just come
from but glancing about around you theres no
sign of your three companions Theres no visuals
that guide you to where they might be
 As you go about to their sleeping
arrangement spaces everything except for whatever
they had on them as they took their watch is still
there The haversack is left behind the rest of
their goods lying on the ground where they were
left
 Yep
 The falchions always with him
 He would have a belt with pouches and such
but no that was on him at the time
 Those are not there unfortunately
 Essentially everything but the equipment
they had on them in fact if you look you can
see Jesters shield is there currently
untouched
 Yasha doesnt have much on her Whatever she
does have she generally keeps on her so she
hasnt left anything behind
 You dont see any weapons Yasha keeps her
weapon on her at all times Fjord from what you
understand weirdly never seems to have need But
Jesters weapon is left next to the shield as well
as you begin to rummage through
 Make an investigation check
 All right then As you begin to rummage
around in the nearby grasses tossing over the
remains of their left behind materials even
pushing through the fire just in case some of them
may have fallen in no sign
 Youd make an investigation check then
 Not within the next mile or so
 Okay
 Okay
  So as you are both losing
yourselves amongst the nearby grasses and trying
to look for any sign of where they may have been
you are focusing on your spell What are you
doing Beauregard
 Go ahead and make an investigation check
 This is amazing
 Knocking it out of the park yall
 Well get them out now In the time that you
guys have begun to shout youre continuing to
shout their names out and forge through the
nearby grasses Caleb you complete your spell
and Frumpkins form suddenly slowly shifts then
with a puff of steam and smoke turns into the
falcon Lands on your shoulder 
 You watch as Frumpkin takes off into the sky
and does a few loops Go ahead and make a
perception check from a birds eye view which
makes it a little easier
 There you go When humanity fails bring in
the hawks
 With a quick singular pass overhead you
watch as Frumpkin sends you an immediate bit of
information You focus through the eyes and
glancing down you see a clearing where a large
portion of grass maybe about  or so feet from
where you guys are has been pushed down And you
see tracks and drag marks and grooves in the dirt
 All right You guys rush over and there you
can see on the ground this patch of disturbed
grass that has been pushed down along with the
dirt that has been jammed and shoved up into small
side piles and trenches that were dug in Theres
definitely signs of a struggle here At a quick
glance looking around footprints and signs
there looks to be somewhere between five to eight
sets of footprints you can see from all different
angles And you can see three grooves being
dragged through the dirt into the grass towards
the road a little bit northward
 Yeah You guys go ahead and follow these the
best you can eventually making your way to the
outer side of the Crispvale Road the path that
you were on already but a little ways north of
where you were And there you can see the grooves
end and a number of sets of heavy wagon wheels
begin or at least have previously pulled off the
trail and then pushed themselves back onto the road
 Its hard to tell which direction wagon
tracks go in necessarily Make a survival check
  Could be going north Could be
going south Youre not entirely sure
 Northeast or southwest
 Youre not entirely certain The tracks seem
to be traveling either in the northeast direction
that the road goes that you were traveling or
heading back towards Hupperdook What you do
notice though and what keys you in that this has
something to do with this is the tracks grind off
the road by about five or ten feet and thats
where the grooves of these dragged individuals or
sacks stop And then it pushes back onto the
road
 Make another investigation check
 Its better In looking through near where
these cart tracks begin theres no signs of
blood Going back and following the grooves
through the dirt you find a few small traces
 No just standard dark dustedover blood at
this point
 Make a perception check
  As you look off looking for any sign of
change theres the fog at the far peripheral of
where youre watching Nothing on the road except
for a couple of tufts of scrub brush catch your
eyes until you see a dark shape on the road to
the south
 Moving It looks to be a shadowed outline of
a person
 They run out in half an hour Its like a
Game Gear
 I think Mollys already off
 So youve nocked your bolt into your
crossbow for the first time As it winds back you
crank it and it slips into place You hear this
faint spring tension
 As youre preparing for this Molly and Beau
start rushing up
 Okay so you head off into the brush
 Make a stealth check
  okay Good to know Molly as you get
closer the shape takes more form As the mist
fades and your proximity grows closer you see a
squat figure Wide and muscular armored with a
sack over the shoulder Ashly if you want to
enter
 Ashly Burch joins us at the table
 So Ashly if youd like to describe what
Molly sees as he approaches
five oclock shadow a cigarette hanging out of
her mouth extremely battered bloodied rusted
armor full armor and short greasy hair And she
has a big ol axe in one hand and a big ol
hammer in the other Does she see these folk now
 Roll a perception check for me
 Oh We should get that for you
 We got plenty
 Yes So roll a d add your perception
modifier
 So you see one figure coming towards you
difficult to make out gender of lavender skin
curled horns filled with jewelry big long coat of
multicolors maroon but then it goes into a
rainbow pattern almost with two glowing scimitars
to each side staring you down Behind that you
see two figures a little bit beyond your sight to
make out all the details but one seems to be a
tall humanoid the other seems to be much shorter
and smaller probably halfling gnome And then
off in the bushes not hiding very well you see
another figure keeping low to your left
this over with And then she holds up her
battleaxe and her warhammer
 The deescalation has begun
 This tiny figure hooded with wrappings
and a creepy porcelain doll face that covers
 A giant falcon  lands
 Its harsh but functional
 Walked over as you poured the drink
 Make a history check
 You have not heard of the Iron Shepherds
before You have some base knowledge of some
families that might do business in the outside
but the information youve been given so far the
Iron Shepherds dont ring a bell
 There it was I was waiting for it If
someone else wasnt going to get there I was
going to do it So thank you for taking it
 There is an aspect of that name that does
 At which point you look over past the camp
where they are and theres a cart and there are a
number of horses that are currently hitched to it
at the moment For a brief moment youre like
Oh the thought of not having to travel on foot
sounds fantastic
 As you guys pack up your goods get the rest
of your material packed up couple things to keep
in mind Looking at the map if you want to pull
it out and get an idea of the direction youre traveling
 As long you guys can see it is more the job
here You can travel with your horses
 With your horse and cart
 Look at that Timing
 You guys are currently right here So you
just left Hupperdook youre on the Crispvale
Roadway making your way to the Crispvale Thicket
which is the large forest at the crossroads You
can travel about  miles per an eight hour day at
a normal pace with the horses and cart you can go
 miles at a fast pace and you can force a march
to go for another hour or two or three afterward
but you start making constitution saving throws or
take exhaustion points at that point But you can
get quite a good distance depending on how fast
youre going The cart keeps you at a slower pace
If you were to leave the cart behind as an option
you could go faster
 You have six horses between five of you as
long as one of you takes the horse head you can
have a pack horse essentially Its going to be
hard to direct it unless someone keeps it hitched
on the side Having an additional horse right now
how are you going to get that to come with you at
a fast pace without a rider
 You can probably carry a few things You
still have horses to help carry things most of
your gear you can still put on yourself Are there
any large things Youre not carrying a manticore
head anymore
 The main pack Id say you can Im going
to say the shields not going to fully fit in it
unfortunately Its a fairly wide shield and wont
quite fit
 A tent you can probably mangle and push in
there and you manage to get the tent in But the
shield someone will have to wear on their back or
strap to a horse
 You can put the shield strap it to a
horse its fine because its just an additional
thing youre strapping on to it Its up to you
 Its just the additional horse is going to
be a problem if youre going to travel at a fast pace
 No there is the Crispvale Thicket ahead
which has the crossroads but theres no town
there Hupperdook behind you or honestly
Nogvurot or Shadycreek Run
 So which one do you leave behind then
 Welcome to the Mighty Nein
 As you say goodbyes to Loaf
 You strap your materials to the horses you
are taking with you
 So youre going at a fast pace Thats 
miles
 You travel in day Which will get you well
within the Crispvale Thicket As you guys are
riding whos guiding this trip Whos keeping an
eye on the road ahead of you as you go
 You can do that Sure
 This is the one thing you see strapped
laying over the back of his horse This giant
rolled up thick blue and silver tapestry
should say So you cant really see my face
 As you take the full tapestry or just a
piece of it
 All right so yeah its you are just
 Yeah
 There you go
going
 Okay Youve traveled this path before so
its well known Whos keeping watch
 Okay Go ahead and make a perception check
for me Beau
 All right as youre heading down into the
center part of the northern side of the Marrow
Valley Keeping a look ahead you can see just as
you crest over this one little embankment the
Crispvale Thicket ahead of you This beautiful
cluster of darkgreen trees The clouds have
completely taken the sky back and its this low
gloomy gray as the air gets chilly as the day
progresses onward getting closer and closer to
dusk You manage to get to the outskirts of the
thicket itself You see the trees growing thicker
and the actual canopy of dark green pine trees
starting to gather You now have the opportunity
if you want to you can travel into the crossroads
and head north or you can skirt around the forest
off the path Those are your because you
havent youre basically having to go to the
center and then back north but youre on the road
the whole time Or if you wanted to skip past it
youll travel a little slower basically a
similar pace
 Well you dont know
 It just depends on your
 Make a survival check
 Looking about you gather the faster route
would probably be to skirt around the outside of
the forest Because you dont have to switch back
even though the terrain isnt quite as well tread
However youve left the cart behind which means
the one factor that wouldve really come into
that is no longer an issue
 At this point in the main road there are a
number of tracks Whether it be horse foot and
cart and wheels of all different sizes Youre not
able to really tell whats the freshest from a
glance If you want to get off your horse and
inspect you can try
 That would be survival
natty one
 You glance down From atop your horse you
look down and see these smattering of patterns
and as you get down closer it just becomes dirt
and you have no idea how to discern what came when
going
 So which path do you guys wish to choose
 So youre going through the thicket or
around the outside of it
 Okay So youre skirting the outside of the
thicket
 Okay As you start cresting around the side
of the forest within the first mile or so you
see an abandoned homestead Maybe  feet or so
away from the forest on the northern side It may
have been at one time a small farmhouse but part
of the roof is caved in There once was a window
that had pane glass that has since been shattered
and you can see jagged edges along the bottom side
of its sill
 Right now Id say its probably close to
four or five in the afternoon You have a couple
hours before dusk really starts hitting
 Frumpkin could yeah And its a one story
farmhouse Its a modest home Single story maybe
from first glance three to four rooms and the
partially collapsed roof on one side shows you
thats its been in disuse for some time Who
knows how weathered it may be on the interior
 About four or five in the afternoon
 So you guys continue
 You didnt get close enough to inspect
 Yeah
 You can certainly try
 Yeah Frumpkins wingspan in this form is
pretty wide wider than the window So Frumpkin
would have to land on the window and then probably
gingerly step in
 You guys watch as the horse rides off to the
edge Keg leaps off the horse
 Stomps up and just kicks the door open The
door is already partially ajar so it  and
it falls off the top end and leans against the
back inside of the farmhouse Theres a brief
moment where you feel a couple things settle a
slight creak and the fall of dust and as you step
inside you can see the furniture is in disarray
There is a layer of dust everywhere There is a
smell of old rot and mildew And glancing inside
you can see theres another window on the opposite
side thats also been busted out This place is
pretty thrashed
 Are you looking for
furniture
 Well you make an investigation check on
that And you make an investigation check to look
for things And if you want
 Yeah go for it
 Oh Sadly no booze
 What did you roll
 Hard to tell in this space
 A lot of the furniture looks damaged some
of it looks burned weirdly As you looking around
on the inside youre rummaging around for any
possible books or anything that can be useful You
dont find any books you do manage to find a
bundle of unused torches five You have a handaxe
thats a little old and rusted but its still
functional Its well made That was left under
one of the shelves that had fallen over And you
find a mostly filled oil lantern While the glass
of the actual lantern is broken it still is
pretty filled with oil So if you wanted to if
you had a container you could fill it and have a
flask of oil
 Then you can go ahead and fill it with oil
 Now you have a flask of oil at your
disposal
 No crests You glance and you do see a
small iron symbol that looks like a star or sun
You recognize it to be the symbol of Pelor It
probably was a mantle of worship here but its
looking on it the metal looks scarred strangely
Its almost like elements of as you pick it up
and glance at it the pockmark scarring on it is
strange And the mantle around it you can see a
lot of the wood and stonework seems to have been
smoothed over in its damage
 Yeah It snaps off
 You get a torch and you get a torch
 Okay So how long does it take for that
 Ten minutes okay
 Wait
 As a ritual I believe its ten minutes
correct
 All right so Caleb youre having this
moment where youre waiting as hes just poring
over this tome and drawing a circle on the ground
and inscribing strange symbols in the air It
doesnt make any sense Youre like Ah magic
stuff
 Everybody else roll a perception check if
you dont mind
  what did you get
 Beau and Keg you guys hear some noises out
back The horses are getting a little restless and
nervous Theyre like  and you
see two of them are starting to clomp back a bit
away from the house Starting to pull at the reins
that have been hitched off to the side of the home
shit Theres something going on outside
 At that point trying to take in what is
sending these horses into a weird tizzy and you
feel this faint vibration in the ground this very
subtle quaking
 Okay still utilizing the same perception
checks you have looking in both directions
nothing There is youre maybe a little over a
hundred feet or so from the tree line Which is
what you were staying close to to not be out in
the middle of the open field But you dont see
anything coming or going
 Okay
 You do Theres this faint 
and it seems to be moving in shifts or in pulses
of intensity getting more intense and some of
them longer and some of them shorter
 No thats what youre sensing
 Okay you guys are headed for the trees
 Spells lost Molly and Caleb start running
out of the home to the tree line And youre just
going up on the roof
 Youre still on horseback you can jump off
your horse
 Right right So youre leaving your horse
there and if you can try and look up on the
roof Part of its collapsed You dont know the
state its in but you can try
 Okay  You start heading back to
the tree line What are you guys doing
a we just can feel the ground rumbling
 You cant you havent sensed anything
Everyone has just started getting nervous and
rushing for the tree line You can hear the faint
rumbling and it is getting louder
 Youre about  or so feet from the tree
line
 Okay Your horse begins to head in a
southward direction
my battleaxe and my warhammer Im going Come
out you piece of shit
 So youre staying by the house
 Make a stealth check
 Caleb and Molly you guys are riding towards
the treeline
 First thing you notice is a splash of dirt
to the south You see a small detonation out of
the earth in the direction of where your horse had
been traveling off You see something emerge from
the ground and your horse ride up and hoof down
and begin to run back in your direction away from
it It seemed to cut it off at the south As it is
running towards you
 You see something spray or splash in its
direction as it turns and it whinnies in horrible
pain before it collapses onto the ground
spinning
 It lies there on the ground making this
horrible  sound As youre watching
from what you can see in the distance its flesh
burning
 It looks in a really bad place At this
point in time Molly and Caleb you hear the
vibration as the ground bursts to the right and
left of you Let me get the map since thats
where were going now
 Yeah were going to move this map out of
the way
 There is Caleb Theres Molly just on the
outskirts of the forest this way Bursting to
each side of you you see these large insectoid
creatures that burst out of the dirt and ground
Beau you are right over on this side as you left
your horse on a southern direction there Both
Nott and Keg are about  feet that direction
 Your horses are currently
 Yeah
 While you guys are over by the house you
watch as this is going on and there doesnt
appear to be any action immediately near you so
youre quite a distance away
 You can If your horse is still right by
the No your horses rushed off towards the
 Your horse is still there thats right You
still have your horse there You can jump on your
horse and head that direction if you want to
 All right so you rush onto that I need
everybody to roll initiative please because we
are now in combat
all these oneshots
  to 
 Beaus up first  to 
 Mollys up next  to ten
 Caleb what did you get
 All right And Ooh
 Not so great for Keg Thats all right Top
of the round Beau
 Theres a third one down that way thats
maybe about  feet away from you that is heading
your direction Its up to you if you want to
pursue that or come help out your friends
 Yeah you should Yeah you can easily get
there
  hits
 That is a six a five plus one It does not
save
 As you rush up to the side you look for
what and what you see now at a close look is
this massive almost eight to nine feet tall to its
head insectlike large cockroachtype creature
Its chitinous armored body is segmented in places
Theres large antennae and these massive pincers
come out of its mouth with its strange insectoid
eyes this gooey saliva thats dripping out of the
center of its mouth As it spins around towards
you you see a moment where between its plates
and its body seems to be a soft musclelike
underbelly You jam your fist in there and attack
and it seems to lock up its body for a moment
Roll damage
 All right so thats your first strike
 Nice The first strike ends up as just
enough to cut past its defenses to stun it As
its reeling from the impact your other blow
crack with your staff to the side hits it and
part of its armor cracks inward exposing more of
its tender underbelly
 Okay you want to learn three things from
it What do you want to learn
 Dexterity saving throw is zero Plus zero
 Plus one
 No vulnerabilities
 Still have a bonus attack
  Technically your attacks have advantage
while its stunned so you get to roll again
 Does not hit Even while stunned you swing
back with your fist and your knuckles glide off
of part of the armor that is still hardened and
it hurts your knuckles and you pull back a second
but its not immediately able to do anything back
at you Thats your turn I believe
 All right that ends your turn
 Molly youre up next
   so youre just out of range
of it but you can use your movement to move up to it
 There you go
 You do You watch as Molly fades out of
existence and then appears Nightcrawler
teleportstyle right behind Caleb
 Go for it
 Yep
 So  damage
  hits
  points of damage All right thatll do
it With that you teleport next to it and carve
it asunder It screams as you slice through it all
three times and you bisect it in the center of
where its thorax begins Falls to the ground and
crumples into pieces its greenish blood spilling
into the dirt and floor of the forest underbrush
 All right ends Mollys turn Nott youre
up
 You do You have  feet of movement
 Perfect There you go Finishing your go
Nott you are way off that way
 Youre about  feet away yeah
 Thats  feet You could dash as a bonus
action if you wanted to
 It does seem to lose your stealth
unfortunately
 You could be low in the brush but youre
not moving quiet carefully
 Well say at that point thatll get you
about to the edge of the board there
 Keg is going to be catching up to you at
this point
 Okay Got you That ends Notts turn Its
now their turn As one of them that previously
killed Beaus horse
 To that side there Another one bursts from
the ground
 On this side and skitters over this
direction This ones going to move up to there
If your horse is there it cant quite move to
that space which is frustrating it Thats fine
Itll pull back a bit then and stay there
Actually no because you killed the fourth one
so its not present As they all turn around and
watching its one friend get cut down they begin
to line up all three of them pull back and its
pincers open as it releases this splashing stream
of deep greenlike liquid that sprays out in front
of it for  feet five foot wide
 Nope this is a saving throw scenario I
need Molly and Caleb to make dexterity actually
for this one its just Molly and the horse
because it doesnt quite get to Caleb on that one
 Yep
 Okay so you take half damage There you go
You take seven points of acid damage
 As it streaks across your body Your horse
does not make the saving throw Your horse gets
sprayed on the side and makes a horrible pained
neighing sound as it falls to the ground its body
now acidically burning away
 Its not surviving this
 This one right here is going to spray you as
well Molly Another dexterity saving throw please
  does not succeed You suffer  points of
acid damage as another stream blasts into your
back and shoulder burning through your flesh and
the side of your face begins to pull away and
smoke Back here this one is going to shoot in a
stream that hits Beau Caleb and the horse I
need you to
 Dex save yes
 Your horse made it though
 That is  points of acid damage to both of
you The horse takes seven Its hurt still
surviving Thats going to end their go Its now
the horses turn
 Yeah
 This ones running Yep And its going to
run off the battlefield there
 Hes dead
 All righty Thats going to end their go
Caleb and Keg you guys are up
 On horseback
 Thats a fairly good distance speed of 
feet
 Thatll get you up to well say up to
there Pretty much right to the edge of where that
is there
 Ill say because a horse doesnt get any
attack on and it would normally get an action
Ill let the horse dash
 So thatll get you right up next to this
one
down with the axe
 Yeah Just for the hell of it make an
acrobatics check for me
 What could possibly go wrong

 So as the horse is galloping you watch
 You watch as Keg gets up on top holding the
reins  Pulls the warhammer out and
then at the right moment just leaps off while
pulling the battleaxe out doing a flip in the
air landing and coming down with both weapons Go
ahead and make your attacks on the opposite side
of it
  hits
naturally
 Yeah that hits So go ahead and roll both
those damage

 Six and 
 Nice Still have your bonus action
 Yeah because youre dual wielding So you
attack attack and then attack
  Still hits
 Yep Armor class of
 Nine points of damage Oof So as you come
down both weapons  clanging onto it you
hear the armor crack from underneath and you watch
as its light green blood begin to seep through the
wounds you left As it turns around this weird
clicking sucking sound out of its face you laugh
 and slam it in the side of the face with
your warhammer  It pulls back and its
now bleeding out of its jaw as it looks pretty
hurt
 It is yes
  misses unfortunately  The bolt
streaks off actually it hits the side of Kegs
armor
 Shearing off
 All right Caleb youre up
 All righty
 All right So you are Hasted there Youre
going to move as far as you can to Nott
 There you go
 That finishes your turn Top of the round
Beau youre up and hasted
 You step around the trunk of the tree
 You get three base attacks correct
  Haste 
 That hits
 All righty
 Nice Third strike
 Yep thatll hit
 Seven points of damage on that fantastic
And you still have your bonus
 Two more attacks

 Hasted monks  Just full on Wang
Chung over here
 So you do get one more hit So roll damage
for that
  damage
 Thats okay
 Thatll do it
 You just spin around the adrenaline pumping
through your veins from Calebs spell instilling
you with unnatural speed You rush forward and
just  and just do the fastest full on combo
You watch as she basically pummels this giant nine
foot insect creature into submission
 It falls to the ground as youre just
pummelling its face until it eventually collapses
and sputters out the remaining breath before it
stops moving
 Fantastic You still have
  feet of movement
 Because youre hasted
 Oh yeah
 You go around the tree and then tap it on
the shoulder
 Just to be a dick
 All right That finishes your turn Beau
 All right Molly youre up next
 All righty
 So move over and push into this space
 Because its an ally Ill let you move into
the horses space there
 Thatll hit
  points of damage nice
 Thatll hit
 Advantage is nice
 All right
 No its still alive

 That one hadnt taken any damage
 Oh wait no Oh sorry I was writing that
down under the wrong one
 My apologies Yes it is dead
 I was writing it under the wrong one So as
you dart off behind the first two strikes you
unleash carve it into two pieces You watch as the
creature as its turning around to hiss and rear
back its pincers about to carve into your face
you watch as the head just rolls off of its body
and there behind you see Molly standing there with
the blades out
 Okay youre going to right there
 Okay That finishes your go Molly Nott
youre up
 The inner range is what
 Its just out of your  range
 So mysteriously
 Perfect All right so As the image of Beau
appears before just standing there quietly
shifting holding its space
 You can use your movement to go behind and
then hide if you want to
 All right so go ahead and roll a stealth
check
 You teleport through campaigns Youre
somehow in campaign one
 All right That finishes Notts turn
 All right
 So its now that guys turn Currently
surrounded by Beaus
 Too many Beaus Its going to go ahead and
see if it can gather which one is the real threat
Rolls a natural  So even with its low
intelligence it can discern the nature of which
 Really Puce Its going to go ahead and
make a bite attack towards you Beau
 That is going to be a  to hit
 Yeah It just reaches out with its pincers
You manage to go ahead and duck out of the side
and slam your bo into it causing it to just
completely miss you It rears back It does not
regain its acid spray and thats its turn
 Both horses just go running off the board
into the fray Or away from the fray
 All right that brings us to Keg
 You can
 Nine damage to that one
will smack him and then Ill smack him one more
time and thats going to be seven damage
 Seven points of damage The first one swings
wide no impact The second one slams as a
backhand into its armor causing it to crack
Using that opening you pull back with your
battleaxe and jam it into the wound carving in
deeper Its looking pretty hurt but its still
standing Anything else you wanted to do in your
turn
 Youre going to hang back
 Thats what happens when you get Emmy award
winners at the table You get that
though
 Yeah thats about it Youve peaked at this
point were done after this Its all downhill
 Well work on it That ends your go Keg
Caleb youre up
 As you finish your attacks you glance over
your shoulder as you hear this sound You look in
the distance you see Caleb who at this point
has been this dirty hobo in the background all
of a sudden fire these three mystical arcane
missiles that glow and arc off animemissile
style through the woods avoiding trees and all
three slamming into the sides of this creature Go
ahead and roll damage
 Ten total  It sits there
for a second after the impact leaving these large
craters in the side of its chitinous armor where
its cracked and bits of liquid are spilling out
of it It looks heavily wounded but its still
alive
 Youre going to stay where youre put
 Revealing her position
 Thats all good That finishes Calebs go
Beau youre up
 That just hits
  does not hit
 Unfortunately no Nothing is actually
flanking it
  hits
  points of damage on the first hit
 Beau how do you want to do this As you and
Keg are both there clamoring on two sides of it
the image of yourself on the opposite end what do
you want to do
 As you crowbar off a large part of its
exterior insectoid armor skeleton it exposes this
horrible yellowish sinewy muscle interior as all
the striations are pulling off of the armor As
its exposed it tries to go in to protect itself
but youre too quick and you zero in and plunge
your fist into its body as it falls to the ground
with a horrible sucking guttural slimy death and
pull it out
 Technically
 Okay
 You can go ahead and make a medicine check
 No the shield was strapped onto one of the
horses
 Youre not sure but it looks dire
 Sure if you want to go ahead and step up to
the horse Make a medicine check
 Unless this horse gets some serious
treatment its done
 Instantly mercy killed
 Nott you do manage to catch up to the other
horses They didnt go full sprint into infinity
They slowed down and once they got a safe distance
from the action you manage to recover two of
them Theres still your horse by the house you
still have three horses
 You can go check
 Go ahead and make a medicine check as you
approach
 Water Closet looks not long for this world
 Okay Water Closet is still technically
holding onto life
 No Water Closets final horrible moment is
its riders cutting its tongue out
 Correct
 Its possible
 As you guys begin to try and work out your
arrangements and the horses unfortunately due to
the heavy nature of your armor and the broad form
and heavy body of Keg it looks like you wont be
able to fit Keg and one other individual on a
horse But there are other combinations that might work
 You and Molly can do it yeah
 Kegs about as dense as two of you
 Unless I am mistaken
 Im going to go ahead and check one element
of this because it will
 The battle was pretty quick You still have
probably another hour and a half two hours
before sundown
from those bugs
 If you want to go ahead and take a shot at
trying
 Yeah
 New toys
 Ive wanted to have a setup like that since
high school And now I can
 Youve never encountered these creatures
you dont have much of an understanding of their
anatomy beyond the experience you had extracting
the aspects from them which actually would give
you a little better idea of their physicality in
some places Because you looked at their
constitution and dexterity Ill say that you know
that the tendons and some of the muscle sinew that
they use in the inside of their body is very
strong and very tight and can be used as cording
It can be used for anything that would involve a
very strong piece of cord or rope
 That could possibly be harvested Its a
dangerous process you can certainly try
 I dont know you can certainly try Its
trying to carefully remove a giant sac of natural
acid from a creatures body You want to roll the
dice
 All right Well you have to pull it out
You have to remove it
 You watch as they pull this pack out and
Beau reaching in pulls out this strange
sided construction It looks like its some
sort of an opaque crystal almost like a marble
type of color Its grayish and its undulating
with some slight pulsing light like a faint
heartbeat with these golden handles affixed to
it As she pulls it out and begins to focus on it
theres this moment of distant meditation before
she comes back with a breath and places it back
in Its a strange sight
 Do you have a blade to harvest
 Super bright right now
 I will say because of your understanding of
its body from extracting the aspects of it do you
wish to utilize nature or medicine for this roll
Giving you the choice
 Go ahead and make your check
 Just a straight check Skill check with
medicine bonus whatever that may be
 Youve seen Beau be pretty precise in combat
and pinpointing the weak elements of an opponents
body This is almost poetry The surgical
precision in which Beauregard takes the dagger and
cuts pulls rips pulls and lifts Tucks finds
cuts removes and within a matter of about a
minute a minute and a half there is a sac about
the size of a basketball the ends have been tied
off and feels like a water balloon
 Make a dexterity check just a straight
dexterity check
 Thats good You do not just puncture a
balloon while looking directly at it You manage
to find one of the areas that taper within this
organ whatever it is that was removed and manage
to siphon it off in a way where you can fill the
rest of your vials however many empty vials you have
 Yeah You have three vials of acid now
 Its more of a tossed weapon or used to
dissolve things
 You guys have taken a short time its
taken about half an hour or so for you to go
through this process of extracting that and
carefully filling these vials and discussing
amongst yourselves who would get what You have
about an hour until dusk hits
 About an hour until dusk
 Yes about here is where the forest begins
and that is where you began your confrontation
Youre right on the edge of the forest
 Make an athletics check
 Yes
 Like a monkey that was raised in the jungle
you watch Beauregard leap from branch to bough
effortlessly diving through this forest
 The afterglow of Haste
 You make it up into the canopy Make a
perception check
 Even at the tallest tree most around you
all you can see are other trees of varying
heights Looking in the northeast direction
beyond where you just came from you can see the
house you can see bits of natural rock that maybe
had either been left by some longago volcanic
detonation in the distance or pushed up through
the ground by tectonic movement youre not sure
You see elements of stone that have broken through
bits of the grass and open fields part of the
natural fields here You havent actually traveled
this far north so its unfamiliar topography to
you youve only heard about it but its
interesting to see that the further north you get
the more rocky the terrain seems to get in the
direction youre traveling You do see far in the
distance what could possibly be the road that
youre getting to but its a ways off to get to
that direction
 You guys continue for the next hour or so
skirting along the forest
 You guys gather some kindling get back to
your three horses and your comparatively
uncomfortable riding arrangement and continue on
for another hour on the outside of the forest
before the sun does eventually vanish The graying
sky is getting darker and darker the faint bits
of orange that poke through its not a beautiful
sunset you only catch the faint hues that manage
to push through the gloom but the sky grows dark
enough to the point where you think you should set
up camp Are you setting up camp at the edge of
the forest on the inside of the forest on the
outside of the forest whats your preference
 Okay You guys set up camp Whos keeping
first watch
 You guys want to both individually roll
perception or one aid the other With the help action
 Go for it
 Plus
 All righty As everyones settling in
begins to find their initial portions of rest you
guys have your small fire there on the edge
Molly you glance off deeper into the forest
and your eyes even at this distance catch a
faint glimmer of matching flame You see a faint
bit of firelight sparkling about  feet deeper
into the forest
 It is dark yeah Its probably pushing
 Owls are nocturnal yes You would know
that
 Okay
 You dont have your long rests yet so dont
mark that yet
 Okay So as Frumpkin begins to crawl through
the forest in the direction of the fire were
going to go ahead and take a break

ASAP Well done Youve won the first giveaway in
the new studio I am excited for you to try it
out its quite delightful All righty Bringing
us back into where we left off Frumpkin wanders
off through the darkened forest
 One two three fuck you As Frumpkin
begins

 Yeah Were in a forest at night guys
Frumpkin makes his way through the dark tree
bottoms eventually coming upon actually this
would be a more creepy setting for this I think
Thats better Frumpkin slowly comes upon the
warmth of this distant fire closer and closer
until coming around the corner seeing a small
fire heating a cauldron of some kind some metal
bowl A bit of steam is rising off of whatever
liquid is in the interior You see an elderly
woman in darker tattered clothing that drapes off
of the body hunched but tall very tall like six
and a half feet tall at a hunch Make a perception
check for Frumpkin please at this distance with disadvantage
 Yes
 The skin of this woman is a faint gray
color almost a grayblue tint The hair is this
matted mess of tangled white and gray that is
pulled back and tied behind the head where it
cascades over the shoulders The ears are long and
pointed out to the sides a bit The nose is wide
and pressed up into the face She is going back
and forth from this little hovel thats on the
large thick one and another that seems to have
fallen and come to rest at an angle next to it In
that small cranny between the two trees you can
see this little hut built of thatch and sticks and
rope to construct this little home Its almost
like an arch thats holding it up Near the ground
of this cauldron you see a child of some kind
that is sitting on the ground holding knees to
its chest It looks to be a boy
 Yes
 At the moment no It looks like she is
going to and from this little homestead and
putting things into this cauldron
 Okay You watch now as the woman takes a
small clay cup and dips it into this cauldron and
pulls out this steaming mass of liquid that shes
contained within it turns to the child walks
over and kneels down beside Places the long
fingers along the shoulder and hands the cup to
the child The child takes it looking at her and
slowly sips from it Burns the mouth a little bit
 Beauregard youre leading up
 So not stealthing
 Roll a stealth check Beau
 Who else is following Beau
 Stealth check from you
 Nope
 A short rest You didnt call it out
 I will allow a short rest before you guys
went to bed Its fine Ill allow it
 The two of you have branched off and are
stealthing you think What are you doing Caleb
 Okay and whats your stealth check
 Okay What are you doing Keg
medallion hanging from the bottom of it and I look
after them Natural 
 You have disadvantage however in your
armor
 The antiWheaton has been found
 You can never touch Wil Wheaton or you guys
will cancel each other out like the bad guy in
Time Cop Oh my god Strangely the stealthiest of
all of you is the dwarf in plate armor
 Exactly All right Molly youre staying 
feet back
 You all slowly begin to approach this fire
seeing the shapes and the figures described by
Caleb previously Beau you step forward and your
foot catches an under root and stumble for a
moment You hear the scrambling of her arms across
the bottom of the forest floor the moving and
shifting of leaves and branches The old woman
looks up in that direction and looks back at you
immediately making eye contact with you about 
feet away Her arms immediately jump up in your
direction as she begins to shout You You will
not take any more of us I will sooner die
 Make a wisdom saving throw
 Yes
 You feel some sort of magical force suddenly
penetrate your mind and this sparkle of colors
begin to spray in front of your face that
completely distract you and obscure your vision
momentarily but you blink out of it and find the
effect drift off of your brain The old woman goes
 and reaches down and puts herself in
front of the boy between you and the child
 Make a persuasion check
 Her immediate tension drops slightly Shes
still maintaining a very defensive position in
front of the child One hand is still up but it
seems that shes pulled back a bit from the
aggressive stance she was previously in As she
lifts her face a bit you can see a bit more of
her expression in the light as the hair pulls away
as she lifts her chin You can see that the face
is humanoid but with a wider nose The skin is
grayish almost a blue tint with bits of a soft
fur It takes you a second to recognize where
youve seen these features before This appears to
be the same type of race that Pumat Sol is
 It is a firbolg
 You can see there is a series of necklaces
that looks to be bones and rocks and stones that
have been polished that dangle around her neck as
adornments and trinkets A few bird skulls hanging
on it as well The child also you see is a
young firbolg as well Knees tucked against his
chest You can see that the child looks scraped up
and bruised and appears to have been injured
 Not my son but we have lost a few yes
 Looks past you for a second to Molly who
is not being stealthy either How many are you
 Very well
 Okay I apologize Ive been on edge for a
number of days You seem to know these people or
have heard of them at least
 Im sorry I am Jumnda Im a healer in my
aged years for the Guiatao Clan We are small in
number and now yet smaller still
 Guiatao
 GUIATAO
 This little one is Umbo He is awake now
which is good fortune Ive been trying to bring
him back to health for a couple of days
 Yes he is under my care now
 The woman Jumnda looks around for second
and takes a deep breath Three days back the
clan was in celebration for the coming of age for
young Duma Roasted boar was prepared and the
twenty of us were dancing around the fire when the
murderers came Slew Toffah and Wolya with their
arrows as they danced together Others fought
Fennis died protecting me and I managed to grab
Ombo here as he had been beaten within an inch of
his life to unconsciousness We fled But I
watched as they grabbed others in nets pulling
them away as they screamed and yet made no noise
You know exactly who and what shes talking about
The methods are very familiar When they left I
returned to nurse those I could back to health
Nila by some luck was off when the attack
happened She returned to find her love and child
taken
 Nila went off to find them alone I begged
her to stay else she join their fate but its
impossible to stop a mother when the child is in
danger So I fear for her life but I understand
her drive So here I am here he is and a few
survivors care to what remains of our village a
ways back that direction She points deeper into
the forest So you know my story whats yours
 They were lucky
 Had you been awake you might have had the
urge or instinct to defend them
 Well youre as brave as Nila
 She was I dont know where she is or if
she has fared well if theyve found her I think
she overestimates her capability
 Her son was Dua
that shes telling the truth
 You may
 
 Well if we indeed have an enemy in common
you are welcome to stay with us And she glances
across you I can perhaps maybe tend to some of
your wounds We have tea thats ready that may
help you in your journey ahead
 Im afraid that is beyond my capability
 Well if there are more of you they are
welcome as well I do not know if I have enough
tea for everyone if there is more but
 No
 I see that you have encountered some of the
ankheg variety
 You gather over to their space Its a nice
livedin space You get the sense this is the home
for this medicine woman who doesnt live directly
with the rest of the village She inspects your
wounds has some balms and natural remedies to
help prevent infection The tea while it is not
necessarily delicious by any means it is very
herbal and medicinal it does fill you with a
sense of rest and relief and what restlessness
you may have been struggling with through a
nights rest is absolved
 As you guys manage to say here for the
evening you get the benefits of a long rest You
come to consciousness Now in the morning day
which is a little more peaceful
 You awaken Over by the fire the little boy
Ombo is sitting there currently with these two
small wooden pikes that are jammed into the side
and some squirrellike critters that are hanging
on them that are put towards the fire cooking As
you awaken Ombo turns and smiles Doesnt say
anything but looks over and inspects them and
then brings them back and hands them out to you
 You dont see her at the moment but you do
hear a bit of rustling in the actual little hovel
in the tree archway
make sure everything is copacetic
 You can
 You notice that the horses have actually
been brought closer Theyve been hitched together
to one of the local stumps to the circle here It
seems that in your rest your very deep rest
through the evening a lot of things have been
tended to and taken care of in your presence
 As part of your long rest and the tea which
you took in the evening you do have advantage on
perception checks for the next eight hours
 Okay He freezes on the arrival
 He seems to smile again looking up at you
looking up at Frumpkin Stays frozen in place At
which point the doorway opens from the hut and
Jumna emerges with a small pouch of some kind
Steps up to the rest of you I see you have
awoken I know youll be on your way shortly but
maybe this can help She pulls back the top of
the leather pack and reaches in and pulls out a
cluster of moss that has been dried and holds it
out to whoevers closest or wishes to take it
 Should you find yourself in a wounded
state this should help you with some rapid
recovery of the wounds It acts as a greater
healing potion but it takes a minute to
administer so its a noncombat scenario
 No it is crumbled and then ingested You
can also put some in the actual wounds if you
like but it is meant for ingestion
 Just north is what I know North
northeast
 If you find her and whatever state you find
her if its not a good state will you promise
me to at least bring her back so we can give her a
proper burial
 Thats all I can ask
 Anyway I thank you Ombo thanks you
And
 No not at all
 He does have a giant owl on his shoulder and
is currently preoccupied with the owl
 Ooh Make a sleight of hand check
 Eight Okay It happens but
 The trick is very visible what you did the
kid still seems amused
 Smiles Frumpkin ruffles his feathers looks
a bit spooked
 Thank you for hopefully doing some good in
a very dark world
 Uh that does not ring a bell
 I apologize I do not
 As you guys gather your things get the
horses ready Ombo approaches and gives a little
wave You watch as Jumma approaches from behind
and rests her hand on his shoulder Looks up to
you and says Please be safe
 Charming adjacent
 As you vanish into the treeline Ombo the
child seems transfixed by the owls behavior
before disappearing behind the trees and you guys
find your way back to the open fields of the
northern Marrow Valley So Now back on horseback
what pace are you traveling at Are you still
going at a fast pace
 All right Are you going at a normal pace
or a fast pace
 Sure
 All right It is absurd There are sketches
across the spectrum of sillyfaced interpretations
and caricatures of the people youve met of each
of you There are little notes to The Traveler
throughout You see people that youve liked in
the past looking beautiful with tiny bodies you
see people who youve hated in the past getting
stepped on by a poop monster Its childish in all
the delightful ways that youd expect from
Jesters capability
 There are notes  I will say Laura
is not here to specify necessarily that there are
passages in Common to The Traveler What languages
do you know
 And there are a number of passages in a
language you dont understand Meatier passages
Longer ones
 So you carry on at a pretty good pace and
youre traveling rather swiftly Though traveling
at this speed its harder to perceive things at a
distance Thankfully this renewed vigor from the
tea that you had for the evening may help you in
that endeavor as well So who is keeping watch on
the roads ahead of you
 All right Go ahead and make a perception
check with advantage and minus five to whatever you
 Correct
 Okay then
 For the next eight hours or so you guys
continue on the trek on the outskirts of the
Crispvale Thicket Eventually coming to meet up
with the Glory Run Road that heads northward to
the direction of Nogvurot You can see theres a
road sign that specifically points up to Nogvurot
southward to the crossroads Following the map and
the path youve charted out in your experience as
well you travel for quite a ways along Glory Run
and then just head straight north towards the
Quannah Breach so youll be going off into just
grassland and scrubland at a certain point
 Essentially About then eight hours hit you
have another hour or so before the sun begins to
go down You can continue to push for another hour
if youd like to and all take constitution saving
throws its up to you
 You can do the one more hour or you can
stop and set an early camp and get another
evenings rest But you do not spot anything along
the way Its a beautiful open field
 You probably have maybe two days more travel
before you get there
constitution is 
 No you travel for another hour of
additional movement which will get you probably
another six miles ahead then well see if you get
a point of exhaustion
 You push for the ninth hour I need you all
to make constitution saving throws please
 Caleb you take a point of exhaustion The
rest of you do not
 On ability checks thats all
 As the sky grows dark the still gray clouds
that have taken the sky overhead the temperature
is dropping significantly It looks like its
going to be a particularly cold night Do you wish
to continue pushing on
 Make a perception check
 Youve push now past hour nine so you
cannot have advantage
 Nine
 Best you can find looking around there are
a few small boulders or pieces of natural rock
formations that have pushed up out of the local
hills as you are moving through this more hilly
area of the northern valley but theres no
alcoves or caves that youre catching a vision of
that would give you safe and out of the public
eye
 Theres only one way to find out
 You can travel for another hour
 Okay Make a perception check
 Its the owl technically not him
 At this distance it looks like its
straight moving rolling hills and bursts of stone
 First watch is you two Do you wish to
combine your perception checks for this watch or
take them individually
 Roll individually
 First watch manages to go by You both keep
a very sharp eye out in the distance Nothing
seems to catch your attention though the night is
getting quite cold Towards the end of your watch
snowfall begins to slowly descend upon the
northern valley
 All right So Molly and Beau taking the
second watch would you mind deciding whos making
perception checks please
 All right both roll
 Okay As you guys go to bed the both of you
keep an eye out for the rest of the evening For
the rest of your watch at least and seemingly
uneventful
 Yeah
 The rest of your watch goes uneventful
leaving to Caleb the final watch
 All right Make a perception check Actually
you and Frumpkin can both make separate ones Ill
let you do that
 I can pull those up pretty quick
 All right so that would be a plus one
 That rely on hearing or sight so you have
advantage on it though because the owl does have
keen hearing and sight
 Thirteen okay Looks like this watch is
uneventful as well You guys had a clean night
 They all seem pretty asleep
 
 Your watch comes to a close just as the
morning light begins to crest into the sky
Theres a mild break in the clouds on the eastern
horizon over the Ashkeeper and the Dunrock
Mountains Youre still getting a mostly cloudy
sky but there are occasional bits of morning
light faint light blues and yellows and soft
white The snowfall that has come throughout the
evening and packed up the very chilly cold night
is beginning to faintly thaw but it is still a
very cold morning As you all begin to come to
consciousness and gather your things the clouds
close once more and you look off towards the
northeast side of the valley and you can see
another darkened cloud coming with more snow and a
less forgiving turn of weather Although its a
ways off you can see it this far away You pick
up your things horses at the ready Do you
continue your journey Anything you want to do
before you head off
 Okay You have to set two horses side by
side and use your staff there to give you pull
ups Theres not any trees here but you manage to
pull it together
 On the road while youre Youre just Chuck
Norrising it between the two horses 
aroused
  Always pulling up
Always
 Pushing on at what pace I imagine
continuing at your hurried pace
 Pushing on for the remainder of this day
who is keeping watch
 Go ahead and roll perception for me
please
 Yes minus five because youre traveling at
fast pace
 Still an  Thats good About three or so
hours into your journey Molly you look up ahead
and you can see a cluster of horses and a couple
of carts heading your direction heading
southward
Youre not quite there yet but youre
getting close to where the direction you should
continue on breaks off of Glory Run but youre
still on the road You do see a small caravan
making their way southward in your direction
 Okay You guys move off to the side
theres anything off about it
 Make a perception check
 Glancing off as you approach you begin to
make out details You do not recognize this
troupe and the cart seems like there are tarps
and cloths laid over large bundles They are
obscured from view specifically so the contents
cannot be seen which is not what youre looking for
 They dont want anyone to see whats under
the tarp which is not the usual operation that
youve seen The folks that travel southward
not of a wealthy regard but those who probably
bring common supplies things from the northern
side bringing them southward It looks like they
have supplied up for a trade run and theyre
heading southward As they ride past you guys to
the right side they give a nod
 The next rider gives a nod
 With the perception roll you made its hard
to see because theyve covered it specifically
You can see underneath edges and pieces that are
pushing out and the shape in places It looks
like theyre bringing farming supplies It looks
like theyre bringing possibly grains and foods
It looks like things that would be easy pickings
Theyre not the kind of people that can defend it so
its maintain mystery and keep pushing
 Okay You continue on On this next leg of
your journey were riding on your perception roll
off the road your natural  Ill let that stand
for a bit The pace that youve been keeping on
this without being kept by your cart has gained
you quite a bit of ground and about another two
hours or so into this afternoon your eyes catch
another cluster of carts facing the same direction
you are
 You may
 It takes you a moment of getting close and
youre about Id say a quarter mile back from
this troupe You can see the familiar two larger
carts one smaller It stinks of familiarity to you
 Theyre moving yeah
man fighterlooking guy
 Its midafternoon at this time Youve been
traveling since shortly after daybreak so its three
oclock in the afternoon You have another hour or
so before you hit your eight hour mark and your
horses start tiring and you start tiring
 Youre a couple days travel or so from it
at this pace
 Yes it is Im going to have to ask you
Keg to make a wisdom saving throw please
 That is not a success You feel strangely
though it is out of character for your intent
magically compelled to offer up a fair amount of
information that would seem useful in the coming
scenario about these individuals
 As much as would seem useful for this
 Yes Interpret that as you feel necessary
 You do know that he walks with this
nastylooking glaive Its a polearm with a large
hooked blade at the end of it that he uses as both
a symbol of station and a very dangerous weapon
if need be Gives him reach gives him range
human barbarian Shes not as bad as the rest of
them Thats all I know
 Youre pretty sure theres a sorcerer
youre pretty sure theres a druid You dont know
a lot about magic stuff but you know one of them
seems to be more naturebased and the other seems
to throw spells but is cocksure and
charismatic
 The halfelf is a very short pointed pixie
cut that is ashy blonde
 The spell comes to a close now because you
have fulfilled the suggestion
 Okay Frumpkin takes off and begins to coast
at a fair enough distance to keep an eye down Make a
perception check for Frumpkin with advantage
 Yeah hes an owl still Owl has keen sight
and hearing
 Frumpkin getting a nice view from this
distance makes out that there are three carts
There is a figure at each cart The two larger
ones have two horses at each front the third one
has one horse There is a rider on each of the
horses or at least there is a rider on the
smaller horse and there are two that are sitting
at the front of the carts that are currently
holding onto the reins of the other two You do
see sitting next to the individual at the reins
at the front a very thick muscular man bald
with tattoos across the back of his head
 With the glaive resting at the side staring
ahead Everyone else seems to have hoods up and
are trying to keep their image obfuscated
 Lorenzo he has a cloak on and stuff but
right now he has the hood back You really dont
see anybody catching their attention He seems to
be enjoying the air across his hairless head
 You see seven figures
 As far as you know most of that process
happens once they take them back because usually
its a grab and run type scenario But they do
usually have them manacled hogtied manacle style
and gagged
 About two days yeah
 Two days at your pace probably three days
at theirs
 All right

 So keeping your distance behind them pulling
your pace back to just the normal even slow pace
its up to you Probably normal to keep in pace
with them
 It was going to happen eventually
 About a few more hours sundown hits well
say for the purposes of the narrative here They
pull off to the side of the road and begin to set
up camp Keeping an eye on this in the distance
you watch them Keeping far enough away making
sure youre not in eyeshot of them as part of
that I will say two of you helm a stealth check to
see whether or not they see you on the road behind them
 Well it lasts for a day
 All right you take your fragment of
possibility So go ahead and roll
 Its afterward You can roll it and then
choose to Its like a luck point
 All right
 You guys stay back and watch as they pull
off and make camp With that as the cover of
everencroaching night becomes your ally you
begin to arc around on the opposite end of the
road going behind one of the larger hill grades
which manages to hide your horses as you speed up
and take off ahead To do this its going to cost
you an hour of pushing past so everyone make your
constitution saving throws please
 Okay
 All right so Beau and Caleb you both take a
point of exhaustion So youre going to have
disadvantage on ability checks
 All righty So pushing forward on this you
come to a point how far ahead of the road of
them do you want to set up your ambush
 foot Maybe
 Right So whos taking a look for a good
ambushing point
 So roll for disadvantage because it is
night Even though you have night vision its only
a short distance
 Correct
 All right you find a place

 I mean its a road So you guys have an
evening to what do you want to do for your
ambush
 Three carts two larger ones and one
smaller
 All you saw was just goods in the back
 You havent inspected them for weak points
youre not the brightest bulb in the shed
necessarily when it comes to these things Theyre
cages theyre made mostly of metal and they seem
to hold They got locks
 Keeping an eye on the area as youre having
this conversation you glance around and theres
an area not too far ahead that you can just see a
little bit of the moonlight breaking through the
clouds The snow has not quite arrived yet But
you can see there are these two small hills that
flank the sides of the road not far ahead where
you can see there are some boulders that protrude
it looks like there is a tree stunk stunk
tree stump and an old rotted tree thats sitting
on another one
 Its not a very big tree If it were to fall
it would just hit the side of the hill and be on
the side of the road
 No theyre not very high theyre maybe
seven ten feet tall at the highest And it looks
like theres been some erosion on the sides where
theyve just slipped on certain edges
 Okay
 Both of you make a dexterity check Well
this would technically be a grapple so it would be
athletics for you
 and then it would be athletics or
acrobatics for you
 Completely pulled out of your grasp
 They cant see them from what you know From
what Keg told you theyre magically cloaked until
you get there
 No from what your experience would be they
would probably go to the hideout to their little
homestead deeper into the Savalierwood They would
drop off their payload and celebrate probably
for an evening of revelry and then come back the
next day to begin the process of preparing them
for delivery which involves breaking them
Run who would love to see them dead
 Presumably There are also people that
would
 would help them They have allies
 I mean theyre working for one of the tribe
families so yeah
 To set the alarm Okay Im going to pull
out the map of the location so you guys can plan
out positioning
 Well the location of hills if you were to
use that one I have multiple
 I have multiple maps prepared depending on
where things happen
 I have multiple maps with different
scenarios
 This is the scenario that youve found
 This is the path heading in a north
direction These are the two hills This is the
tree How would you like to set this up How do you
want to do this
 I could see you probably do something like
that sure You have a little bit of time
 So where are you going to fluff the bushes
up here Like what are you doing Point it out to me
 
 All righty
 You can try You can certainly try
 Make a strength check This would be
athletics actually So make it athletics because
this is you not just lifting it but also
bringing it along
 You begin to drag it actually You watch as
this burly dwarf woman with a fiveoclock shadow
that is now coming into actual faint stubble grabs it
 begins just dragging it through this big
groove in the ground as you pull it over Where do
you want to put it
 And you have this tree here
 That tree is actually somewhat hollow Not
completely all the way through but there is an
alcove in it where some of it has rotted out
 All right So Nott Ill go ahead and mark
you as this will be where youre hiding just as
a note there
 Im excited Weve been gone for two weeks
Im like lets do this
 That tree is maybe  feet  feet
 Actually that one would be  feet tall
 That you can do
 You can certainly try
 Go ahead and roll an athletics check for
this one
 Just
  okay So youre able to carve into it
and use your knowledge of where to hit properly
and where the strength should be applied you
manage to cut a few wedges into it It begins to
move slightly and youre like nows the time to
stop
 Okay so Molly youre going here
 Beau
 Bush two here
 All right Beaus going to be here
 And youre going to be behind the tree
 All righty
 Thats the north side
 The leading cart yeah
 The carts are about that wide
 Theyd be going through one at a time
 You have no idea
 I think it lasts for an hour or until
 Yeah it ends for a target that attacks or
casts a spell But itll last for an hour
concentration yes
 Yes it does Its still you concentrating on
the spell
 They both are
 You can only have one or the other
alarm go off
 Its like 
 Okay
 Are you guys happy to pull the trigger on
this
 Okay then
 You have your placements Youve set the
scene The evening requires some rest if youre
to prepare for this by the morrow
 So you set up a small camp here without
light Without fire
 Youre setting up camp without fire for the
evening Or are you lighting a fire for warmth
 You set up the tent behind the hill You
spoon for warmth
 You muster through an evening of
uncomfortable but necessary closeness which its
a very cold night A faint bit of snowfall greets
you in the morning Not enough to coat the place
in white yet Its these soft little flakes making
their way down A ways up on the road a few miles
out there is a front of gray heading your way It
looks to be a wall of snowfall that probably is
going to be coming about midday or so in your
direction Theres some mist in the distance You
come to you shake it off Youre a bit stiff from
a night of not necessarily comfortable rest but a
long rest is had You lose your exhaustion points
As you take a moment Caleb the bells go off
 You do if you want You would have to redo
it again Whoever wants to do it has to do it now
 Okay You guys arent treating it like a
 Whippets from Xhorhas This is great
 As you guys are in your places the first
cart comes up
 All right As this one comes through you
notice the person whos guiding it is your friend Protto
 Continues to push it along and they
separate as they see the coming pinch of the road
Behind that you see the central one This has the
one figure that you dont recognize whos driving
the cart and walking alongside it is Lorenzo
This one begins to continue forward and this
pushes forward as well
 On the sides of this there is the halforc
druid Thats Dwelma and Ruzza whos the
halfelf
 In the back is the small singular cart
thats being ridden by one figure and there
helming the end is Juam the human ragefilled
warrior the one that youve had the better
experience with
 Correct Pushing forward until about there
 Are you doing this
strength check
 Roll a strength check
 The tree immediately falls forward off the
side snapping at where it was left
 Actually all of these tree pieces were sent
by our friends at Steamforge as gifts I was like
I get to use these at some point and you guys
are using them tonight Falling and snapping right
at the front half of the cart breaking through
Im going to give Protto an attempt to try and
dodge out of the way He succeeds with a dexterity
saving throw because hes quite dexterous He
jumps back into the front of the cart and you
watch his lower half vanish as he stops there
stump
 You dont know Actually thats a valid
point Im going to have you guys all roll stealth checks
 Yeah Ill say in advance
though
 All of you are pretty stealthy except for
you As the tree falls onto the ground all the
horses suddenly rear up and youve actually
broken where the horses are attached to that cart
The axel snaps
 At which point the carts back up at this
point Theres a shout in the back and you hear
Protto go like Boss what is At which point
youre doing what
 First for the sake of order here because
we are engaging in a series of aggressive actions
lets all roll initiative please
 First order of business here for initiative
Im going to sit down for this one real fast
write it down  to  anybody
 Beau and Nott up first  to 
  you said Caleb
 That brings us to
 Whatd you get
 As the tree snaps and hits he shouts back
Immediately the group looks out at all sides
taking this as a means of assault Lorenzo
glancing over and directly locking eyes with you
Keg Theres a look of taken aback and surprised
Before any reaction happens though you do get
your action You are casting Slow you said
 How many can you target with this
 Up to six Thatll be quite a lot You can
get all of these guys if you want to
 Well lets see because its  
yeah This whole section here
 Theres six people there
 Theres the one whos helming this horse
the one whos helming these horses the back of
the cart and then those four
 For the two thugs that are on the horses
two and a three Natural two and a three They are
both slowed
 Ruzza does not succeed Ruzza is slowed
 The druid does save The barbarian the
barbarian does not save
 And Lorenzo that is a  Saves
 This all happens Combat has begun Starting
 Oh Got you I put them in the wrong order
 Okay thats your action
  He looks at it sees you dart
by
 Okay He cant make an attack of opportunity
on you
 This big one there
 You dart in and as soon as your vision
comes through you come facetoface with a metal cage
 Right there in front of you For you who can
watch the back half of Nott is still visible The
entire cart is filled with cages Front to back
 The cages are blanketed by some sort of
illusion
 Correct but just the front half It looks
like Nott vanishes partway through like youve
stepped through part of a doorway On the inside
you see a very sweaty human man who is gagged and
leaned up against the cage like  He
looks up towards you
 Thats all youve got
 You can just get to the druid at  feet
 You do have to get down there
 Make an acrobatics check
 You manage to land without losing your
footing You get right up to the druid there
 That is
 That is a natural  plus three is 
 Go for it
  total Okay
 All righty
  Whats the DC
 Okay going into defensive mode That
finishes Beaus go
 All right Its now Ruzzas turn who is
slowed
 It doesnt go off until the next turn
 Ruzzas going to step back looking towards
Lorenzo and goes Boss this is so weird Its
weird to hear this sloweddown deeper voice
coming out of this female halfelf but
nevertheless here we are As she steps away and
begins She does give a bit of bardic inspiration
to Lorenzo because shes technically not a
sorcerer
 Thats as much as you know
 Oh thats right So theyre not doing
that
 Still saying that phrase but not in an
inspirational way Is going to cast glancing over
in your direction as the source of it
 Once you cast the spell you reveal yourself
buddy Thats how it works unfortunately
 This is going to be Yeah lets do some
Hypnotic Pattern Why not
 He begins  and slowly
backs to here getting up on the hill climbing to
get some better visual perspective over the
battlefield Thats going to end Ruzzas turn
Molly youre up
 You can get right there
 Thats  feet there
  feet
 Flanking To there you mean
 Yeah you can do that
 Yeah
 Go for it
 You do
 I assume you had your rites prepared
 Seven points of damage All righty
 That hits roll damage
  points of damage Youre carving through
Shes not slowed by the impact of the spell and
taking these wounds hurting her quite a bit
Shes not horribly maimed but is starting to show
some wear from the strikes that shes suffered
That ends your turn That brings us to Lorenzo Hmm
 Lorenzo watching you and your friends
shouts out in your direction and goes
 Well hes not slowed
 Keg I dont know what youre trying here
but I think the lines been drawn Hes going to
step over here pushing through the horses
leaping over in the direction of where Nott is
there and is going to shout out Hey Move
aside and holds his hand out in front of him
Thats going to end his turn
 Protto is currently like freaking out by
this sees this all happening narrowingly missed
the tree slamming into him goes and pulls out his
bow and nocks an arrow into it and is going to
take a shot Lets see the one he saw dart that
ways going to be Molly Hes going to fire at Molly
 Whats the range on it
 Yeah
 Is it a  or  foot range
 For your Blood Curse of the Eyeless
  feet Yeah thatll do it
 Amplified so disadvantage on He gets two
strikes
 First one with disadvantage is going to be
 to hit Whats your armor class
  so that hits Because youre adjacent to
an ally of his he gets sneak attack bonus on that
 Thats going to put him
 To be fair its a shitty sneak attack roll
Thats a total of  points of piercing damage
from the first arrow into your shoulder
 The other one is going to be
 He did yeah
  on this one
 Because it was an  and a ten he rolled 
and its plus six on his attacks
 Okay the other one just deals six points of
piercing damage
 Hes going to jump off and move over here
up onto the top to get a good view since hes a
ranged guy with his arrows Hes keeping down and
getting ready for that
 Thats going to go ahead and that was his
action surge and everything so hes done Next
up Bear with me guys There is a lot going on
right here
 Caleb your turn
 Yeah you had the ambush round technically
because it was the trigger Slow and then
everything happened at once The tree triggered
the ambush seeing you so the only one who got a
round off was you for the spell
 Okay go for it Roll for attacks on that
 Minus two to their armor class
 Goes wide
  hits
 That would hit
 Okay so two hits Its d
 Not a bad opening round
 Yes To maintain
 They still have to make a concentration
check to see if they can finish with their
casting yeah That is a  plus two That is a
 So yeah theyre fine
 Is that the end of your turn Caleb Staying
where you are
 Okay You go prone Caleb goes prone Okay
now its the thugs turn They are slowed so they
cant move too far This one is going to move
back Thats as far as he can move and hes going
to pull out his crossbow and he gets one shot
because of the Slow spell Hes going to take it
towards you Caleb with disadvantage because
youre so far away
 The bolt goes wide This guy here is also
slowed Hes going to attempt to back away
 They do not Hes going to attempt to use
the edge of the tree for some cover as he takes a
shot at Beau
 Yep And that is going to be a  again
 Now it is Juams turn who is slowed and
right here next to Caleb is going to take a
strike at you Not technically only gets one
attack so the first one wouldve been 
 Oh you did Thats right you do not
 Ill have to double check
 Thats the two thugs turns Thats Juams
turn Keg youre up
 No it makes sense Weve all done it to
some degree
 Which the armor that Lorenzo is wearing
youve seen it before Its studded leather but
its straps and hooks The theme of it resembles
very much elements of his profession or at least
reminding you what he does So the oil weirdly
does make it strangely erotic Its your turn you
have  feet of movement so thatll only get you
about five squares of movement
 Are you running towards the action or away
from it
run towards those horses Im going to run that way
 Make an acrobatics check to leap down
 Okay so you lose the last five feet of
movement Thats your movement there
 Your javelin has a pretty decent range Does
it have the ranges next to it in the app Thats
okay I have it here The javelin its  and
 feet So it can go  feet without
disadvantage and  feet with disadvantage
 So you might as well
feet
 Protto is Right up there on the hill
getting his arrows nocked
to throw at Protto With disadvantage Five
 Completely passes over
no I cant
 No you cant Thats where you are You can
take another javelin attack because you have
three javelins
 You get one more swing at him
even bother
 Both javelins miss Youre shaken by this
experience
 Its now Dwelmas turn Dwelma is going to
cast Dispel Magic
 Not unless you have the War Caster
 Mage Slayer I mean
 The magical effect which is the Slow
effect
 If its any spell third level or lower the
target ends so Slow fades
 Not from being stunned she couldnt
MARISHA Oh well cool Feels really good about
failing it twice now
MATT Sorry Shes going to move to this side
Actually and is going to run So you both get
attacks of opportunity on her
  is not going to hit Not with Barkskin
sorry Actually no She doesnt have Barkskin
because of the ambush She hasnt had time to cast
it so its an AC of  You do hit
 She is stuck there
 No she circled around Its when she leaves
the range so she gets stuck there That ends her
turn Now Lorenzos turns going to trigger
 I think it just misses you Its right
there
 As a Cone of Cold bursts forth from
 Lorenzo smiles as his friends have
come out of the way and this burst of freezing
cold arcane energy swirls in front of him
flashfreezing everything in front including the
cart actually
 Nott has to make a reflex save Beau and
Molly have to make sorry dexterity save Oh
thats a relic
 Nice
 Go for it
 Oh buddy All right Okay What did you
roll
  okay Nott you take  points of cold
damage
 Okay so you use your reaction to halve
that
Okay
 Molly you take that would be  points of
cold damage
 Beau you take  points of cold damage
 Yep As it triggers and the frost finishes
off in the space there Lorenzo grinning looks
over his shoulder back at Keg and goes like Am I
going to have to make a lesson here
 That brings us to the top of the round
Nott youre up
 Go for it Make your lockpick check
 Dex and proficiency so it would be seven
yeah
 Its not enough You spend a moment and the
lock is not going These are pretty intense cages
and you look over there and Lorenzos standing
there with the glaive
 You move through a very small gap theyre
pushed up against each other Make a strength
check to see if you can push through you might
not be able to
 You cant push through it the cages are too
close The small gap there you try to muscle it
but there are two to three people in each cage
and you cant push though
 You could try youre partially obscured
 Lorenzos eyeing in that direction
 Okay make a stealth check
 You appear within your mind to have
vanished from the current sight
 All righty That brings us to finishing
Nott Beau your turn
 Go for it
 Oh snap
 Ten damage Oof Dwelmas looking rough
 Yeah
 Although technically when the Slow spell
finished a Hypnotic Pattern may have gone off
Yeah that would have gone off So make your
wisdom saving throw if you dont mind
 Yes
 Glancing around the area it looks like the
people that were right on the outer edge of the
cages are frozen
 The guy whos near you hes fine They
blocked the impact there It was your latter half
that was sticking out that got blasted
  all right so the Hypnotic Pattern does
not affect you Well done
 She goes down
 Like unconscious and bleeding out
 Yeah if you want to
 You could
 You are
 Okay Make an acrobatics check
 You get over the horses Where are you going
to stand on the cart Theres not a lot of room
here to stand to fight and youd have to get
over
 Ill say you can get back right here
 Sure why not
 So youre on the horse
 Yeah
 Yes you are
 That ends your turn
 That brings us to Ruzza Ruzza who watched
the druid go down sees you over there being
really defensive and looks around Hes going to
attempt to cast Hold Person at level three I need
Mollymauk and Beau to make wisdom saving throws
please
 Completely resists it Shit
 Back up around the tree trunk there That
ends her turn Molly youre up
 Thank you for sticking with us I know this
is going late but I want to see how this turns
out Weve been gone for two weeks Consider it a
bonus episode
 Its possible
 You can climb over the cart if you want to
 Its up to you
 Okay make an acrobatics check to try and
get over the cart without issue
 Ten You lose some movement but you still
have enough to get right there Thats as close as
you get Lorenzos technically supposed to be in
that space
 No you do not
 Take your damage
 Nice
 Ten does not hit
 That first strike carves past You see blood
spatter across the edge of the hillside Lorenzos
like All right I see what youre doing One for
one Slams the glaive onto the ground That ends
your turn Molly It is Lorenzos turn Lorenzos
going to go ahead and make two glaive attacks
against you
 Youre still level five
 First hit You guys watch as Molly falls
back unconscious Lorenzo looks confused His
vision still obscured the blindness
 Yeah Actually youre not flanking because
youre at an angle Youre on the horse So no
The first strike slams down into Mollys chest
the blade actually sinking about seven inches into
the chest Blood spatters out of your mouth You
can use your reaction to make an attack
 As Sentinel you can yes
  does not hit so it misses there
 Lorenzo looks back over towards Keg Looks
up at you Beau and says An example it is
Molly in the brief moments of consciousness what
do you want to be your last words
 No
 This is done
 Molly you have a brief moment As the
consciousness and life leaves you what are your
last words
 As it slams into his face Respect and
then twists the blade The life leaves Molly
 Its now Prottos turn Protto is going to
take a single shot because he used his action
surge Now that hes gotten two javelin tossed
hes going to fire at you seeing that youre in
the proximity Thats a natural two misses off
your armor Youre not even paying attention
Youre looking over at this and you feel it
deflect No impact Caleb your turn
 Okay The thugs take their turn Both of
them are going to
 Theyre both going to back up and take two
crossbow shots at Beau You have your Patient
Defense on
 That is still a  and a  they rolled
 Thats right First one you deflect out of
the air
 No she already used her reaction And the
other one is
 You use your reaction to do it But it
rolled a  to hit You watching this happen
hear it deflected off The other one you catch and
drop still looking down at Mollys notmoving
body As Lorenzo now grins back at you and says
Is it time for another or have you learned your lesson
 Then another life it is All right that
ends thugs turn
 He does not see you
  Youre the closest there The
barbarian goes pulling in is going to use an
action to move up into melee with you but thats
their turn This is not looking good guys Which
brings us to Keg Keg youve seen these
situations before What are you going to do
 Can you reach who
 No
 With the tree there about there is as close
as you can get You can use your action to move
but you wouldnt be able to do anything else
 You can You move up over the log and it
gets you there
Stop Just stop attacking them
 Make a persuasion check
 Okay thats your turn Dwelmas bleeding
out Nott your turn
 You hear Keg shouting and midbattle
parleying
 Okay You pour acid on the lock Its going
to take a moment Acid isnt an immediate thing
if youre not going to splash it on somebody It
has to eat through metal
 You would know that as an alchemist
 All right
 I think the signs are pointing in a
direction What are you doing Nott
 Beau its your turn You see Nott run
 With just your movement
 Right there
 Beau you see Keg rushing to parley What do
you do
 Okay hes going to make a dexterity saving
throw
 I know He fails
  Roll a d damage He is on
fire
 Just d fire damage
 Four points of fire damage Theres now
flames curling off of his body Hes taking it
 Roll for it
  Hes not even looking at you Hes
looking at Keg
 She has his attention
  does hit
 Okay
 Theres a reflex for him to go ahead and
take an attack of opportunity on you with his
glaive and then he flickers and looks back to
Keg seeming more interested in what she has to
say That ends your turn
 All right Ruzzas going to walk up
 The moment she does anything what were you
going to cast
 Okay As youre watching her very
carefully Shes going to do it Shes going to
step up and cast Cure Wounds
 Mollys dead Cure Wounds isnt going to
affect him She reaches out and touches Lorenzo
and he heals up a bit She starts to try and pat
the flames out a little bit and he shoos her off
Now it is Lorenzos turn because Molly doesnt
have a turn Lorenzos looking at you and says
Looks like we have an eyeforaneye scenario
Points off at Dwelma who at this point has bled out
 Well say yes shes bled out at this point
You say you want to be an example huh
 Sure Puts his hand up flames still
curling up and burning his body which roll
another d
 Puts his hand up with the glaive in the air
and you watch as all the other thugs looking off
pull back their crossbows to the side The
barbarian in front of you Caleb this woman whose
face is twisted in absolute rage panting
snarling puts the hammer down Lorenzo says
Were going to make an example of our old friend
Round up what you can You walk with me Keg and
leads you back over to where the rest of you are
As the warrior steps back still burning takes
and leads you here They begin to move forward and
push the carts begin to push the log off of this
to the side and the warrior woman grabs the front
of the cart where the horses were and begins to
drag it forward As it begins to pull away
 Its a flash freeze and then it goes away
Its not like it keeps it there As this one pulls
forward one of the thugs grabs the body of their
druid and throws it over the top of the cart where
she seems to vanish except for a leg dangling out
the side of the illusion They go forward Grabs
your shoulder and pushes you down onto your knees
Do you do anything
 Looks at the three of you The Iron
Shepherds have a reputation and I expect you to
tell everyone you come across what happened here
today and what a mistake it is to turn against
us Pulls the glaive back slowly and leans into
your ear and says Thats a bit too quick I want
you to live with the memory of what you did
today and kicks you in the back and knocks you
onto your face Turns around finally pats out the
flames Were moving on If I see any of your
faces again  Well at least youll be
able to see your friend on the other side
 Fuck me indeed and he turns and joins
the rest of the caravan as it begins to pull back
on the path leaving the four of you beaten
bruised and glancing off at the lifeless
bloodied body of Mollymauk Tealeaf And thats
where were going to leave tonights episode

 Uh sorry
 No this is part of the game
 That was a terrible convergence of events
 It does
 Wow Im going to sit down
 Well thank you guys for sticking with us
this long I know its been a late night Our
return after a week off and the drama has
certainly kicked in Well pick this up next week
Lets use this week to love each other
 No please dont Everyone here is playing

it was circumstantial and this is how the game

fucking villain now in your campaign Oh this is
going to be delicious Be kind to each other We
love you all very much Lets take a week to
remember Mollymauk
 Not with what you got
 On that note once again we love you guys
Have a wonderful week and is it Thursday yet
Good night

 Okay then Last we left off The Mighty Nein
were making their way northward across the
northern side of the Marrow Valley toward the
city of Shadycreek Run to fulfill the second of
two jobs they had accepted from The Gentleman
while they were in Zadash Along the journey
while they were leaving Hupperdook in the middle
of the night three of their members had been
taken It was discovered in the morning when they
were nowhere to be found that they had been
captured by a group of slavers traveling north
back to the city of Shadycreek Run itself Upon
investigating the details of this capture you
encountered an individual coming up the road with
a similar aligning interest Keg In discussing
the means of traveling to find these individuals
responsible and discovering that Keg had
information on them you decided to travel
together making your way around the Crispvale
Thicket Encountering a number of indigenous
insectlike creatures known as ankhegs near the
longabandoned farmlands that were once built in
the outskirts of the forest Camping inside you
encountered a few members of a firbolg village
that had long existed hidden from the world
within this thicket that had been assaulted by
these same slavers known as the Iron Shepherds
You encountered an elder protector of this tribe
along with a boy who had survived this encounter
and were sent off on your way Traveling northward
on horseback you managed to catch up and actually
make ground on the Iron Shepherds Comparing your
intel and through a few surprises as to what they
were carrying a plan was hatched to set an
ambush to halt them in their tracks and assault
them Upon the plan taking off things were going
in your favor but through a series of bad lucks
A bad lucks the plural its an actual English phrase
 They were bad A series of moments of bad
luck and a toolate realization of the
overwhelming power of the foe you faced one of
you fell Mollymauk lies slain in the middle of
the road at the hands of Lorenzo the leader of
the Iron Shepherds Making an example pushing Keg
onto the ground leaving her with the knowledge of
what he perceives as her fault to live with it
and to spread their name and the terror of what
they do and not to let anybody else get in their
way You all watched quietly unable to really
have a moment yet to digest what has happened as
you see the carts slowly quietly make their way
your eventual destination And thats where we
begin Theres a faint bit of snowfall thats
still coming down from the clouds above you there
in the valley The flurry the storm that has been
encroaching is not that far off You look down
past the somewhatmuddy tracks of the wheels of
the carts that had headed away from you your
horses still stashed alongside the outer hills in
which you had set this ambush You look down to
the bloodied still body of Mollymauk as the snow
slowly begins to fall and rest upon his form
 Do you resist
 Yeah the tapestry of Bahamut is still
rolled up and strapped over the back of one of the horses
 About two days travel and its maybe a two
hour journey into the forest north of Shadycreek
 Easy enough to find You have to go through
a few pockets on the inside of the jacket but you
eventually find where he keeps them
 Okay so you have the periapt of wound
closure
 The only things that you would know of
Shadycreek from your experience would be
whatever miracle workers that would exist there
are owned by the tribes and weird tales of
strange hermits that live in the forest beyond the
city
 Not directly no
 From the beginning
 Close to  or so days since you left
Zadash
 Okay on Molly you find  gold pieces and
 silver pieces amongst a cluster of other knick
knacks and trinkets if you are so interested
 Near one of the hills
 No he took it with him
 There are branches to the tree that you had
cut down some of the logs that are there there
are some pieces of branch that could be utilized
 Okay
 Id say given the size of the claw and its
earthen attachment it can make in that minute
that it has a fairly functional hole
 Okay As you guys carefully and respectfully
take the tapestry of the Platinum Dragon Bahamut
and use it to wrap him comfortably the spell ends
and the hole is complete
 Okay
 I mean theyre both pretty fancy but one
of them is a brass gold color Its the one that
you had found not too long ago
 The Summers Dance
 Caleb youve stormed off a bit around the
way to the little bit of scrub and a few trees off
to the side where the horses are set Theres a
new horse standing there one that wasnt with the
rest of your trio
 Medium brown in color
 Yeah Its looking right at you
 No other person that you see no
 It clomps up meeting your step with each
step you take
 Its outer shoulders and welltraveled
muscled body begins to shift and change before
you Its form in some ways pulls in others extend
outward Sumalee if youd like to join us at the
table please

 Right
 Welcome
 Make sure you scoot in enough for the
camera there
 If youd like to describe what Caleb sees as
the horse is no more and theres now a person
standing before him
sevenandahalffoot tall firbolg I weigh about
 pounds and Im wearing some
Mongolianinspired almost like a shepherd I have
a round face a wide nose No pointy ears though
My ears are soft and floppy I stand tall
strong My shoulders droop a little forward Im
looking with big round eyes at all of you
 You glance over and you see the extremely
tall female form of this firbolg humanoid with a
face that comes to a deerlike shape to the front
floppy ears looming over looking right at Caleb
whos taking a step back and looking up towards
her
 Its early morning
 Apparently
 The fight was right at dawn
 Its maybe an hour after sunrise at this
point and the sky is still mostly clouded and
becoming lighter The flurry is coming closer
there is a gentle snowfall coming down at this
early hour
day
 You gather the last of your things retrieve
the horses and head out
Im going
 Okay
 Yeah you had three left after the previous
battle
 Correct You guys can double up
 Until you take a rest
 As you guys gather up onto your horses Keg
takes the lead and you all begin your trek
northward once more Both memory of Mollymauk
behind you on one shoulder and the image of the
face of your vengeance before you You continue on
your journey for the next hour or so before you
catch a glance Keg at the road above You see
three shapes in the road
 Perception check
  You get a little closer and you look and
it looks to be three figures that are left in the
road People left in the road
 Not moving
 Swoops down and does a few loops over it and
within a moment of scanning can see it is three
bodies A human man appears to be in his forties
a younger halfelven man in his twenties and a
young human woman probably in her twenties early
thirties or so They are all slain but there is
no sign of traumatic wounds or any damage to their
body though they are damp
 Damp
 There is snow on the ground You can see
theres bits that are gathered on them
 Okay make a medicine check for one thing as
you glance at the bodies
 Not too bad You recognize the man as the
one you saw in the cage before you and at a quick
glance you can see elements of flash frostbite on
parts of their skin You gather they are probably
the ones that were in the cage in front of you
 You manage to pull the bodies off the road
into the grasses on the side
 You do know Keg looking at the road
youre about at the point where you diverge from
the path to follow up the road but continue on to
Nogvurot but to head to the Quannah Breach and
eventually Shadycreek Run is due north from where
you stand
front gates Is there any sort of circumventing I
could do
 Unfortunately not without adding another
week or so travel through the mountains
 Its possible but its a treacherous
journey to move through the Dunrock Mountains to
get there
 From where you are now its a little under
two days travel
 You do know that just beyond the Breach
there is a gate that is guarded by one of the
families of the tribes There is a toll thats
taken as you pass through
 That can help them hide if they want
 If anybody wants to hide it does help out
 Keg leading on to the north you diverge
from the Glory Run Road heading into the high
grasses of the North Marrow Valley You continue
on for the better part of the day taking breaks
as necessary and for you to recover your forms
You continue pushing on not at a breakneck pace
for fear of catching up to your quarry but enough
where you know at least you are keeping pace
Eventually the light of the sky begins to grow dim
as the evening calls to you at which point the
flurry has come The snow begins to get heavier
the darkness is darker than normal at dusk and the
air gets bitter cold What do you wish to do to
set camp
 You can see up to a foot distance I
believe and its a dim light
 Make a perception check
 Pretty decent The hills here you dont
see any structures per se but if you take a
moment to walk around you do see one hill that
has a bank that is eroded and there is a bit of
an outcropping that may be about three or four
feet outward If you were to all crowd in it
might be able to prevent piercing wind andor
continuous snowfall but it would be pretty cozy
 You guys gather up here on the underside of
this outcropping of the hill Whos taking first
watch You Keg Make a perception check for your
watch please
 Looking out towards the distance as
everyone else is silently sleeping in a cuddled
spoonlike position at times you glance out and
see a few shapes moving past You see a few stars
blink out as shadows move past You quietly lean
forward and begin to inspect and your eyes focus
at the outset of your darkvision You notice a
small set of goats that are roving the plain
making their way The snow is falling and theyre
trying to find themselves to warmer climate
 You dont know that
ASHLY Dangerous violent weregoats
 You dont find any other threat or anything
during your watch Next watch
 Beau make a perception check
 Everything seems pretty kosher
 During your watch is when the heavy part of
the storm begins to hit No thunder Its just
very cold and you can see your breath and youre
having to involuntarily shiver as the cold kicks
in You can see now the snow piling up and youre
thankful at this moment that you found this
outcropping in Kegs vision because the distant
hills that are open are now heavily piling with
this soft powdered snow Its starting to fall
and the wind is pushing through and some of its
hitting the left side of your face Its starting
to go a little numb and you have to brush it off
every now and then and try to do your best to dry
up the biting cold water that is melting against
your cheek Nevertheless your watch comes to an
end without an issue Who wants to take the final watch
 Make a perception check for me please
 Well youre lucky because nothing of note
happens during your watch You are nervously
keeping your eyes out just in case waiting for
another reverse ambush but nothing seems to catch
your attention As the morning comes to because
you guys managed to cuddle I would like you all
to make a constitution saving throw with
advantage please
 Constitution saving throw
 Ill say the winter clothes and the
closeness of the group sure Ill say youve
avoided in your hearty goblin form Youre used
to rough weather anyway
 Keg in full metal armor not so much
 You do add your modifier
 Yeah youre fine You shrug it off without
issue
 Caleb your warm coat keeps you warm
 Exactly Youre used to these Zemnian
nights
 Thats enough to withstand it not a
problem
 While the forest definitely keeps insulation
to the storm your body is well suited for extreme
weather as well Actually tricksy winter
clothes but you got it
 No you got them for a reason Thats what
theyre there for Because of the body heat and
everything Ill allow it
 As you guys continue your trek northward for
the next day you slowly push forward and watch as
the rolling hills of this northern valley begin to
even out The high grasses growing dense and
dusted with snow in the wake of this snowstorm
that has passed through the night Its now this
beautiful ice topped wonderland before you As
the storm is past breaks in the clouds begin to
slowly emerge and show you glimmers of blue in the
sky With sunlight comes a welcome comparative warmth
and this dusted field of diamonds begins to slowly
thaw over the middays journey The looming peaks
of the Dunrock mountain range approach closer
engulfing your horizon almost like a toothy jaw of
some ancient titan that surrounds your peripheral
You can make out as you get closer the craggy
break in the mountains ahead familiar to you
Its like a spiral fracture of a bone where
suddenly what was once a solid mountain range
seems to have torn and sundered into two separate
ravines that seem to share a similar shape This
you recognize as the Quannah Breach You guys
begin to approach by mid to late afternoon the
front of the breach where you can see six
crownsguard in a small outpost built at the base
of the Quannah Breach These as you know are
usually folks that essentially warn people from
traveling into the Breach and if they do let
them know that any return is going to be probably
highly searched and highly inquired They enforce
it unless you slip them some coin Then its not
an issue on the way back Theyre more there to
make money
 As you approach familiar to you a
crownsguard begins to put a hand up to the
approaching horses and say Hail
 Where are you traveling to
 You have business in these cursed lands
move along
 Well your life is your own as is your
business but you must understand that coming back
is no easy task A thorough search and inquiry
into your person will be required
couple of coins and you let us on our way please
 Very well How much do you give him
 Customary to your experience and the times
that youve traveled with the Iron Shepherds its
usually about two gold to just pass
 He takes it and quietly lets you pass Per
person
 Well eight because she pays herself
 As you travel through these winding ravines
choosing the one to the right which you know to
be the wider of the two the low howl of the wind
thats traversing these sheared twisted walls
like a haunting whistling and moan sound It
accompanies the brush growing more dense The air
grows colder still as white banks of snow and ice
frame various ledges and outcroppings along these
strangely curved and smoothly sheared cliffsides
It feels like a giant had grabbed a mountain range
and tore it in two and theres an even break on
each side It winds and curves Its like a
natural labyrinth A few miles through this
strange maze youre met with a makeshift wall and
a tenfoot wooden gate Your eyes at first
notice a few dozen wooden poles carved into spikes
that emerge from the ground pointed in your
direction from the base many of which are stained
dark while others still bear the weathered skulls
of warning Three armored folk stand there two
human men and a halforc woman all bearing weapons
and watching you carefully as you approach
 This is the gate
 Youve reached the edge of the Quannah
Breach and turned to the final bastion outside of
the Empire
 Its the gate into the region of Shadycreek
Run
 This is
 Well theyve noticed you begin to turn and
approach
 You would know this is coming because youve
traveled this before
corner
 Im describing it as you or youre
describing it as youre about to turn the corner
 Depends on if you pay them on the way
through
 You know that the previous gate Generally
you dont have to pay them the one you entered
It just helps you with no questions asked issue
This is the gate run by the Uteloch family of the
tribes and they enforce it both as a means of
making money and to know whos coming and going
 So its an equal price to what you were
paying previously
 A single horse you can do
be me and Beau Or me and one of you
 With Beau its possible Not at a full run
but at a travel journey you could probably do it
 In this shady ravine just as it comes to an
end before entering this next valley the shadows
seem to coalesce and cling to you and where
previously the light itself is shaded and dim
Its almost like youre stepping through
moonlight
 Well meaning like looking at those of you
in the radius its like its nighttime where
youre standing The shadows are heavier The
blacks are crushed
us look like
 Like Robert Duvall good
 Okay perfect
 Those of you who are trying to be
inconspicuous which would be Beau and Keg go
ahead and make general stealth checks
 That is what the spell does
 Okay as you guys turn the corner you now
see the gate and the spikes and the warning skulls
and everything
 As you approach the halforc steps forward
and goes Hey you Where you headed today
 Well you pass through the breach you pay
the toll
 Good Pay up
 Two gold each
 All right Let them in She steps back in
line with the two other they pull the two gates
and pull open as the wood clacks against the sides
of the gates You all make your way through as the
guards watch as you pass in For a nervous moment
you see the eyes pass over the two other riders
but make no issue as you continue inward You hear
the gates  behind you Now looking
ahead you can see the curvature of the ravine
opens up into a widening valley You see a
limitless forest of climbing pines sprucelike
trees only the common green you expect stands
instead an unexpected purplegray in color This
wide blanket before you of this deep valley of
fading purple and gray color at the tops of theses
trees Along the tree line you can see a
sprawling and matted line of snowcapped
buildings hovels and mudcovered streets that
vanish into this dense forest The city does not
keep the normal cohesive shape of most instead
being a long line built along the tree edge and
some sort of river or creek that it has been
constructed against It is a weird crooked long
town that vanishes into the branches and leaves
Youre no longer within the Dwendalian Empire
Welcome to the Greying Wildlands
 And to the lawless town of Shadycreek Run
Anything you wish to do before you head to the
city proper
 Obscured in the sense that youre
inconspicuous in dress
spell is for an hour Okay
 This little
 A short ride you eventually hit the outside
of this township Walking into the main street
you can see theyre slick with mud and dirty snow
Ragged peasants clutter the alleyways looking
your way with hands extended for some sort of alms
theyre hoping to find
 An emaciated dog growls at you from a nearby
doorstep and then darts off down the road behind
where you passed A wagon appears stuck in the mud
as you pass it roughlooking folk tugging at it
and stopping to stare you down as you slowly move
past They continue their work You nearly step
over someone with your horse who appears to be
passed out face down in a patch of dirty snow A
bit of crimson rests at their side Theyre not
moving As you circle around them you watch as two
roughlooking fellows in hide clad armor come and
inspect him As you glance over your shoulder you
watch as they rummage through his pockets lift up
his not moving body and dump him in one of the
nearby alleys and keep on walking You see no
Crownsguard
 This is the first town any of you have been
in that has no watch No law keepers The road
doesnt go far north from where you enter as most
of the town is this long stretched bar so within
 minutes youve hit the plaza The central plaza
to the town that you know as the Clover Plaza You
see log benches dotting the open area while a
four story tower of motley colored stones stands
vigil over the area Two balconies and a top
housing crossbow and longbow wielding roughnecks
You know these to be Taskers Youre heading
towards The Landlocked Lady Easy to see On the
eastern side of this plaza there is a very
beautiful two story complex that comparably
seems ostentatious against the buildings
immediately to the right and left of it which look
to be in serious disrepair and rather rundown and
colorless Just bland woods gray and brown Here
you can see the second story above the main archway
a curved top arch there is a false bow of a
ship that is emerging outward This beautifully
carved mermaid in the front that is clutching the
piercing front of the ship There it rests with a
sign dangling from it saying The Landlocked Lady
 Comparably yes
 Its like Shanghai China everything looks
different
pass by them
 Youre skirting around the outside of the
main Tasker tower Theyre scattered around and
as you guys are walking around you see most of
the people that live in the city are in absolute
squalor and are here out of necessity are here
because they came seeking some sort of fortune and
failed or theyve come to indulge in vices that
have slowly crushed them The other half of the
populace are usually armored to some extent
whether it be patchwork hides chain leathers
Almost everyone here is armed even on a scale of
poverty there seems to be a general sense of
needing protection amongst the chaos Some folks
look like theyre trying not to be seen many
parade their thickened arms You see one female
privateer looking individual that comes through
the streets and spits on somebody whos huddled by
one of the stumps Growls at them before
continuing to walk on Its a very unique and
curious motley group of people that call this
place home
 If you talk to
 No ones close enough to you you think if
youre quiet enough
the only other people in this shithole that might
be of use
 What you can tell about the Taskers is they
wear chain shirts with one leather shoulder
pauldron that is painted blue I say painted blue
because most of their uniform is whatever they can
put together to create some sort of consistency
There is no built uniform What youre used to
seeing with Crownsguard and any other royal
military where things are built with fine
craftsmanship everything here is put together and
slapdash That one uniform mark is usually the
chain shirt and the one blue shoulder armor Some
people paint it completely some put a line on it
and leave it there like a Fuck you Im not
going to finish it
 Kind of For the most part theyre keeping
an eye out in the sense that they dont want
complete anarchy
but theyre slightly less assholeish than the most
 Theyre not going to stop someone from
spitting on a peasant but if all of a sudden a
giant riot breaks out they will break it up and
beat everybody up till it stops
 You do keep your mental stats in beast form
Ive seen it argued back and forth and Im pretty
sure when we had you in your elemental form last
campaign people were saying that you could still
technically talk in that form
 Thats right Youre unable to actually
speak in the animal form but you can still communicate
 Its a fairly decent sized tavern Its one
of the more populated areas
 Every now and then
 The Sour Nest is northeast of where you are
in the city Its beyond this city into the
actual Savalierwood About maybe two hours
travel
 Beyond the city The northern half of the
city is almost entirely within the forest itself
 No The Sour Nest is beyond the city Its
its own little stronghold that exists separate
from the city itself
 Its noticeable Its half a mansion half a
small stronghold It has gates around it heavy
walls that have spears atop them

 Hey youre in a town
 Its two story and theres a subterranean
basement floor to it They do have hired guard
that keep watch on it while theyre away and
occasionally while theyre there I can eventually
provide you with a layout because you would know
Youve been there a number of times

 There is an alley off to the side that if
you wait for a moment for nobody watching you
guys would be able to step out
 You have the opportunity to revert if you
wish
in this crazy place
 As you guys hitch the horses to one of the
hitching post off to the side you make your way
into the brothel And thats where were going to
take a break
regroup
 Were going to take a little break here
Well be back here in a few minutes guys The
giveaway we have today we have a Bolivian
rosewood Hero Vault with Celtic knot It looks

 Forever No but well come back from the
break with a winner here for you guys and well
see you here in a few minutes

 Hello everyone and welcome back First we
have our winner for the break The winner is
Wundur WUNDUR Wundur congratulations
Chandra will whisper you and get your information
and get that sent out to you Well done Getting
us back in As you guys step through the archway
the double doors opening as Keg pushes and leads
you inside The first thing that hits you is a
fresh smell of lavender a vanilla incense that
strikes your senses stinging your eyes with its
potency On the inside you can see a handful of
round tables of which two patrons are currently
eating a meal that has been placed before them
something else
 Possibly or a live one You can see candles
that are placed at the center there these fine
silks have been placed Its such a stark shift
from the dreary and generally muckcovered
exterior of this city to step into what seems
oppressively luxurious Though the closer you
look everything is frayed at the edges
Everything seems to have been here for a while or
seems to have been weathered through travel or
use The immediate shine begins to fade as you
begin to see how much of this is probably a fair
amount of work to keep the upkeep of the facade of
luxury To the left of you you can see a carved
windowlike bar or a desk and there behind it you
can see a human man probably in his late s His
hair very short and the male pattern baldness is
just starting to set in You can see a bit of the
shine of the back of his head begin to poke
through He has a very well kept handlebar
mustache that curves out very wide to each side of
his face and a pointed Van Dyke matching beard
point that comes to the bottom He has a vest over
a light green billowing shirt that has a wide
collar that curves out to the sides As you enter
and take in he immediately glances over to meet
your gaze and goes Why hello everyone glad you
could make it Welcome Welcome to the Landlocked
Lady How could I be of service Oh you are a big one
 Wonderful are you looking for work
 No worries Well youre here for a reason
I presume Do tell me what do you seek We have
rooms for rent companionship to join as well
What do you seeking
 Yes Do I know you
 My bosses
know you like to pretend
 Are you referring to
 The Marduns are not around here today
They are at the Estate Sybaritic
 Its their estate its where they live
 Sybaritic
 Youve passed by it youve never been
there
 Yes you may
 Hes a shifty motherfucker and youre not
entirely certain hes telling the truth or not
but seems honest enough Lord Anselm does pass
through on occasion but hes not here today The
rest of them Im sure are busy with their own
business but if I see any of them I could ask
see if theyre being summoned by what is your
name
 Make a deception check


 Plus
 Rick Very well Ill make a note If this
is pressing business you are more than welcome to
attempt to summon them at the estate as I know
not how often they pass through but in the
meantime you said you wished rooms and company
 How many
really feel like I want to stay around this guy
that much longer Do you guys want to go to this
estate or do you want to stay here
 All the information that you have from The
Gentleman is that an individual named Ophelia
Mardun who is a friend of his he sent you up to
give her aid with a problem that shes having
 Nila pulls up this small pouch with a
leather flap on the front and pulling it open
there is within a moment a pungent smell that is
a mixture of earthy almost mossy scents mixed
with spice mixed with rotted vegetation mixed
with a bad cheese Its a plethora of smells and
they come in waves She buries her nose into this
for a second and takes a huge 
me what I sense
 Make a wisdom check
 Add your wisdom modifier
 The smell comes into you and amongst the
barrage of various smells you catch a rosy sweet
smell that cuts through the rest
will be a good outcome
 Make a wisdom check
 You get a faint whiff of sawdust that
quickly shifts into a very old molded after a
rain leather
 As you get close
 You dont even get that close to it You
have a fairly strong sense of smell and while
some smells in your experiences of the world have
put you aback you cant even describe this
odorous musk that hits your nostrils causing your
entire face to wrinkle and recoil
 At this point Champ who has leaned
forward watching this goes Out of my
curiosity Im now invested Might I have a sniff
as well

 I didnt want a piece of the stink pouch
anyway
  No no Lesson learned His eyes
start watering Would you like a room for the
night What are your preferences
 I must warn you if its more to a room and
you require a companion the group rates are a bit
more expensive
have a nice rest together just sleeping its
more money
up a huge nest of leaves and sleep together
 Are you sure youre not looking for work
 At this point its almost dusk You guys
have traveled the better part of your second day
to even get here
 For the most part yeah They only come into
town to occasionally drink and essentially parade
dominance Every now and then checking in to
assert their reputation and if they have to do
other bits of dirty work They are slavers by
normal trade but they do other things for the
Jagentoths if need be
anyone else about us
 Youre not entirely certain It depends on
if they assume theyre being chased or they feel
like the demonstration was enough but you dont
know
 Of course not I have a business to run
 All right For a singular room rate for the
night that will be one gold five silver
 Any preference of companion We have a
spectrum to choose from
 Would you prefer it a surprise
 Her That is a preference Very well Goes
and writes something down Can be done For a
nights companionship do you wish just for an
evenings stay or for the night over
 That will be an additional five gold
pieces
 An additional five silver Just racking up
the tab then The rest of you
 The four of you
 Very well suit yourself but Ill be here
for most of the night if you change your mind
 All right Two per room thats two gold
for the group rate so four gold for the two
additional rooms please
 All right He gives a key to each of you
for each room
but next time
 You guys all scatter to your separate
chambers and find yourselves a as restful as it
can be given the events recently nights sleep
Beau drunkenly you have enough consciousness to
recall eventually a knock at your door
 Standing there you see an amberskinned
elven woman a little older than you with very
bright almost platinum hair that is pulled up
into a high ponytail that drifts past the
shoulders seeming a very sheer negligee
 Vorsah She pushes you in the room and
closes the door
 Cut to black
  Heres to you Mrs Robinson The
morning eventually comes some of you more
hungover than others but as you come to and
gather yourselves and wash for the coming day you
hear the sounds of almost broken roosters outside
north this side of Wildemount for these poor
birds
 This is very much the Deadwood of the
continent You can already hear the town coming
alive outside the occasional shouts youre
unable to make out the words but the morning has
definitely kicked in You gather your things and
make your way down to the bottom floor where Champ
is not currently there Theres somebody else
looks to be a younger man probably in his late
teens early s He appears to be halfelven
with this curly mop of brightred hair on the top
and a smile and hes currently going through a
ledger of some kind
 You do not
 As both Nila and Keg have enjoyed a decent
meal not as much as youd expect for the money
that was paid included for the evenings stay but
a meal nevertheless
 Eventually Caleb and Nott make their way
down to join you
of paper and some broken spectacles and says Nott
 All right so whats your plan
 Perfect
 As Nilas out there healing the roosters and
youre leaving the young curly redhaired
halfelven proprietor at the front leans forward
and says Im sorry I dont mean to intrude but
whatever it is youre after good luck and I hope
youre on the right track
 Sorry Im Keelyn I take the early shift
here Its a man Vibrant green eyes But Ive
overheard youre going to see the Marduns Just
listen carefully
 Listen carefully
 As you listen and talk with them
 That works as well but
 Nothing Theyre gracious employers I enjoy
my time here but just listen carefully Im
trying to help thats all Good day Be off be
off
 Good luck Takes a little glass of tea and
sips it
hes sketchy
 Yeah go for it Hes pretty sketchy
eight Like is he trying to fuck with us
 Its hard to read He seems forthright
enough but also guarded Its hard to tell
 Me About six seven months
 I mean it has its benefits
 Be on your way and good luck Sips the tea
again
 They definitely seem to recede a bit
 A use for goodberries Ive not yet seen in
my years playing DD
 All right As you make your way back into
the streets of the city you begin to make your way
back into the Clover Plaza Now do you know where
youre going
 Youve not been to these estates
specifically because your employers are
diametrically opposed to the Marduns but you know
the vague idea of where it is But youve never
traveled there You could probably ask around if
youd like If you were to search for somebody who
would hopefully be of help
 You can go back and ask
 Hi again
left the first time Do you know where their
estate is
 Youre looking for them and you dont know
where they are
 Northwest outskirts of the town limits
within the forest Look for the dark red wood exterior
 Youll find it I trust
 Because this place is a shithole and decent
people are hard to find
 All right You guys head out into the
streets and now its interesting As you head
out into the plaza its much busier than it was
towards the evening you were here before You see
a small regiment of people Armored geared up
Weapons

 BattleBards And Syrinscape You glance and
see  or so of these figures all in various
types of armor and weapons Theyre in lines
ramshackle It resembles something military but
by people who arent trained by military or at
least have any interest in that type of regimented
standing You see at glance a few Empire
soldiers three in full armor Not crownsguard
but from the actual military that are inspecting
up and down the line
 It looks to be You recognize most of the
folks here to be Grudge Gang
 You have a question
 Well theres the military The Crownsguard
are essentially the general guardians of every
township and they do day to day law enforcement
 The actual military soldiers you saw
gathering on the outskirts of Zadash when the war
first kicked in and passed one of the large
armies traveling eastward from up by the western
side of the Silberquel Ridge
 No Your father would have been lowlevel
military
 No Its slightly above Crownsguard
 Yes and watching as you pass by You get
the sense that it looks like the Empire is hiring
mercenaries for the war
 Coasting around the north side You tell the
group to make a wide berth outside of the trench
Which is on the northern end of the plaza
Following the directive of Keelyn you start
weaving toward whats called North Clover Clover
Street youve now begun to note is the large
central street that is the one throughline of the
entire city It runs all around the treeline of
the Savalierwood Its strange and not straight in
places and it was designed to follow the southern
border of this forest The northern side of it
North Clover is built directly into this forest
You know Make a history check actually Caleb
you can make a history check too
 Not bad That works Youve been at this for
a while The Savalierwood has been cursed for many
centuries The oncegreen forest now stands a
greyish purple ashen color that it now holds and
the superstition and mythology around it has
allowed the city of Shadycreek Run to prevent
Empire encroachment They built the city into the
space and every time the Empire has attempted to
move forward theyve pulled back and used it as a
defensive position Essentially over a number of
conflicts the Empire just gave up and let the
region exist on its own It is dangerous the
wood The deeper in the more dangerous it gets
 Its nestled into the forest even further
north of where the city stops in the forest
Continuing on you begin to enter the canopy of the
south Savalierwood The shade completely consumes
the city at this point even though its
midmorning and the clouds are broken up so that
occasional bits of warmth and sunlight would
occasionally pass through the city now it seems
like its almost dusk immediately Occasionally
you see a leaf tumble past and then another Its
almost beautiful the color but it does have
almost a decaying sense to its meeting between
grey and purple Its beautiful in light and then
when it hits the ground it almost looks like its
bereft of life You dont understand the nature of
this enchantment whatever this curse may be that
youve heard of
 You could do a nature check if you wanted to
try
know
 Correct yeah This is beyond you In all of
your experience and youre very connected with
the land of the valley this far north youve not
encountered something like this The forest the
best you can tell the forest still lives The
nature of where it draws its life and this color
is very unnatural and it spooks you
 It feels alive and you pick up the leaf that
you saw tumbled before you and you feel it and it
still brims with health It also offputs you You
get chills and you dont know why
this
 I think stink pouch is still my favorite
phrase
 No smell bag is great
 Make a perception check
 It still counts yeah unfortunately
 You dont see anything specifically You do
hear birds so it isnt bereft of wildlife At
least you get the sense that there is at least a
symbiotic relationship with some wildlife in the
bit of the forest youve been in
draw one of the birds and see if I might talk with
it and see if it could tell us anything about
before
 Make an animal handling check
 As you hold the goodberry out which with
your arm length is a good nine nine and a half
feet up towards the lower hanging branches and
you  give a little counterwhistle to
the sound of one of the birds you hear You hear a
retort  and you return it bird
whistle and then it returns bird whistle
flutter and then down onto the edge of your hand
you see this tiny little blackbird with a white
stripe that goes down the edge of each wing It
 and starts eating the goodberry
messing the edge of its beak
 Its eating the goodberry What would you
like to do
 Are you using a spell or are you using your
firbolg ability
 That allows you to speak to animals
Wait which one is it
 Speech of the woods is your firbolg
ability
 If you look on your spell list the cards
you have prepared do you have Speak with Animals prepared
chose my Spirit Totem
 Oh right Because youre Shepherd
 Yes you do because youre Circle of the
Shepherd
 You get to mark off one of your stlevel
spells As you ask the bird the bird returns
and you guys hear her whistle to the bird and the
bird whistles back quite a bit this beautiful
song that plays The bird conveys to you Far
far before my time
 Be wary of spirits
 Be wary of bonespurred beasts
 How long does the spell last
 It lasts for ten minutes
 Okay you focus and express mentally and
through small verbal gestures towards it the idea
of this color and this shape Immediately the bird
 takes off
 You guys all start keeping up and jogging
behind it You watch as it goes  and it
lands on a post lands on a little roof looks
back at you   and its
waiting and showing you a path through these
streets In doing so youre dodging past
originally when you walked in there were broken
down tent cities and hovels and not a good space
Here the road and alleys break down Its more
sparse The buildings are further apart Its less
of like a gridded city and more of a cluster of
buildings that are generally more well made and
you get the sense that this is the wealthier area
You in your experience know that the North Clover
is where most of the tribes the different ruling
families exist and claim their territory You
move past a couple of buildings eventually the
bird bringing you to a beautiful twostory estate
thats in the beginning stages of showing
disrepair The darkred wood appears imported and
the tall stone fence that encircles the building
is topped with sixinch spear tips A few that
look bent and off kilter but still dangerous
enough for somebody who wished to try and leap the
six sevenfoot fence The courtyard houses a once
beautiful garden that now turns grey with the
winter You can see rose bushes that have since
browned and withered but the roses still slowly
left there to dry and lose color You can see in
the center of this courtyard a small fountain of
some kind but now its filled with slushed snow
and here the bits of the snow that have been
pushed off the streets give way to this estate
thats glaring now at the outskirts of the forest
You can see beyond it its just wood This
definitely marks at least at this part of
Shadycreek Run the end of the city before you
begin to crest into the Savalierwood itself There
are three individuals that are wearing simple
chain mail that are walking inside the courtyard
One has a crossbow at their side the other has a
shortbow across their shoulder One is sitting
looking out The other looks like theyre eating
some sort of dried meat from a pouch and they
glance over and watch as you approach and keep an
eye
 Theyre not Taskers no
 The one thats sitting stands up and puts
his crossbow like ready not pointing it at you but
 What is your intent here
 I can take your message and pass it on
 Make a persuasion check
 He goes And theres five of you
 Ill pass on the message Youll be
summoned if necessary but  Gives
a motion over to the other guard whos finished
eating whos also pulled the shortbow off the
shoulder and has knocked an arrow into it Gives a
whistle and the doors to the estate open and you
watch as three more guards emerge with crossbows
and one with a heavy crossbow at the ready They
all keep them at the ready very close eye One of
them begins to patrol the outside of the building
You get the sense immediately that theres a
general anxiety and tension at this space when
strangers approach Theyre being very careful
 Make a perception check
 You glance up and on the second floor there
is two sets of double windows Theyre paned one
of them looks to be partially opened and you can
see on the inside there are curtains One the
curtains are closed the other is drawn to a side
and you see a figure looking out below As soon as
you look up and see it the curtain closes
 The figure looked to be human though the
skin was dark Thats as best as you can get
before they vanished
 You see all the other guards each place one
of their weapons pointed directly at each of you
and the quiet comes over all of you as this
moment this standoff continues for a minute two
minutes As the first guard that you spoke to
enters and closes the door behind
 Shh One of them tightens the grip
 This large heavy crossbow already notched
backward and the tension on the wire itself is
this guy is looking like he is ready to fire
 A moment later the guard emerges from the
door All right stand down
 They all pull their weapons away looking
disappointed
 Open the gate The guard who was eating
earlier puts the shortbow over the shoulder
still looking wary and theyre not moving from
where theyre standing Theyre all keeping a very
close eye on all five of you Opens the gate
  The metallic gate swings
open and youre all brought into the courtyard
As youre begin to follow the first guard you
spoke with they all slowly coalesce behind you
still keeping their weapons at the side but ready
if need be As youre led to the interior chamber
of this estate the Estate Sybaritic As soon as
you enter the main foyer the earthy smell of the
forest gives way to the lingering scent of a
recent meal As if the cooked meats and starches
that were eaten maybe an hour or two beforehand
still permeate the air of this entryway You see
before you a staircase that continues upward red
carpeted before switching back to a second floor
In that center landing you can see a very open
window that looks down to possibly a backyard of
some kind but currently the view is of the
darkened leaves and bits of sunlight that break
through It seems like something that was built
for a beautiful view not understanding until it
was completed that it didnt really catch much of
a view amongst this forest like the original
builder had brought sensibilities from outside to
bring them in and it was not compatible with this
landscape There you see to the left and right of
you art pieces that depict people You can see
individuals of different backgrounds and you see
one that appears to be of pure elven blood with
brown hair difficult to make out the gender but
beautiful and standing very robust with a chin out
and a wily grin Oils very well done To the left
of you you can see the other portrait appears to
be a woman with a very well made dress with these
large almost puffs at the shoulders It seems
almost trying too hard to be aristocratic
Its garish but here you are A moment
later the door closes behind you and youre still
being flanked by this bevy of guards You hear the
heavy footsteps coming down the staircase Turning
the corner you see a figure now framed in what
little of the light is coming through that window
behind them  Stepping down you see a
woman darkgray skin and anklelength black hair
that is smooth and straight that falls behind her
You see bony crests of horns that curve up into
these two large points behind the head and bright
yellow eyes that are pupilless A grin that shows
two fanged canines As she descends you can see
her attire is very formal colonial style coat
with epaulets but it seems to be tailored to not
hide her figure She already exudes an air of
powerful aggression and presence With each step
that she takes down there you can sense her
immediately reading and seeing in and through each
of you Quietly she takes the last step to the
landing here in the foyer  You
bring tidings from The Gentleman you say
 Well you have invoked the name of my
comrade You have my attention do not squander
it Why are you here
 I am
 Thorough I appreciate that Well so you
are the help that he sent Timely three days
earlier would have been better but here we are I
shall not fret on it Thank you for coming Be at
ease go watch the back walls make sure nobody
tries to sneak in while were talking The guards
all scatter except for two who stay posted at
each side of the door behind you How much have
you been told
 You watch as her eyes looks you from head to
toe and her tongue runs across her lip a bit
 Ive had an open line of shipments to
Zadash through our mutual friend for some time
made a beneficial arrangement for many years
 Sure make an insight check
 Oh god
 Anyway bringing it back in
 However my most trusted team of smugglers
that handle that route and knew it well were slain
a little over a month ago
 Well at first we thought it was maybe the
dire beasts of the wood around us but our
internal priest was able to divine the source of
their demise In other words at the hands of the Jagentoths
 Now weve as you seem to know this well
She looks over you You look familiar What is
your name
 Keg I know that name
 At which point you hear the guards behind
 The crossbows go back up into
position You glance over your shoulder to see
them both pointed What assurances can I have
that I not need strike you down where you stand
information about them
 Make a persuasion check with advantage
 Intriguing Very well They go down
 We and these Jagentoths have feuded for
quite some time between these tribes Many times
it has come to bloodshed but now with the Grudge
Gang and the Taskers making open justice
throughout the realm messy we must take to other
means We cannot deliver our retribution with
hands that can be traced back to us As this
affects both the Marduns and The Gentleman he is
wise to send you and this kindness shall be
repaid in person The Jagentoths have slaughtered
and stolen from us a major source of contraband
and income Its only fair we do the same in kind
We here of the Estate Sybaritic require you to cut
one of the limbs of their business Kill their
best handymen Hunt the Iron Shepherds
 Hunt the Iron Shepherds
 I have not been as far south as some of
you I can tell
 She says to you in Zemnian Well stick
around  Last I heard they are still
out on the road They live at The Sour Nest a
small stronghold not far from here on the edge of
North Clover to the eastern side They have a
number of hired hands that guard the locale Its
a difficult infiltration but its your best
chance of catching them off guard If you have
other ideas we are open to suggestions Am I to
believe that you have been sent and her eyes
fall over Nila as trained killers able to deal
with this
 All right Let us hope that the priest was
not incorrect Either way I would like to see
them taken down a peg So do you accept this
offer
 Nothing to get out of it Kill everything
within it
you guys does that mean you cant help us at all
Give us any assistance as far as your men
firepower nothing
 No We can offer maybe a bit of change to
grease a few palms or bring some aid your way but
we cannot be traced to this at all This needs to
seem unrelated A strange occurrence a random act
of murder was in their home so as not to quell
this already boiling blood between us
 Well I dont know Theyre there often
But if youve made it this far north perhaps you
are better at finding this information than we
 Best intel we have involves that they hire
their mercenaries from the Grudge Gang They
prefer to find people with keen eyes and distant
shot
 Just members of the gang
 All over the city but the ones theyve
hired will probably stay within the estate
 Of course That is what I do She refers
to the two guards behind you
 I havent seen them return yet no
 I have
 If they have arrived recently perhaps my
whispers have not come to me yet
less guarded
 They usually and she pulls back her
sleeve and you can see the dark gray almost black
skin there beneath You will find a burned
crescent into the wrist of a member of the gang
 Are you saying The Gentleman has not paid
you for this endeavor
 I was made to understand that that was all
taken care of as part of our arrangement
 What are you asking for if I might
inquire little girl She leans forward with this
creepy smile that crawls across her face as she
eyes you up and down
 You have a problem with someone beneath the
earth I do not know if our priest specializes in
such abilities and if they did it would be for
family only
 Youre mighty presumptuous You might have
better luck with any of the wandering crazies in
the city
 Our priest is not the only one She cocks
her head If youre looking for help could look
to the Blooming Grove
 Its about six miles out of Shadycreek Run
to the northwest a little farther from here Its
a burial grove but there is a temple there and
some strange hermit of a priest is said to live
there Most folks are spooked of them The family
that once looked over that grove has slowly
dwindled as the years have gone on and they say
the curse itself seems to hold it but try that
Otherwise you need to do quite a favor for us as
such magic is not inexpensive
big enough favor
 Youve already been paid for that
 Good Thats what I like straightforward
and working to the fine print Very good
 Well lead you out the back route Eyes on
you leaving my estate would be unwise So Begins
speaking in Zemnian to the two other guards
youre the only one who picks up on the language
says Please lead them through the back tunnel
She turns around and begins to ascend the stairs
stopping and looking back over her shoulder the
hair swishing with each step as she makes her way
up looking back and the yellow eyes glancing
back with the bright white teeth against the
darkened skin Do not disappoint me I can be
very frustrated when Im disappointed Turns back
and makes her way back up the steps
 Two guards yes
 They wordlessly walk and lead you around
through a dining chamber back to a small storage
itd be kitchen adjacent though you dont see a
kitchen yet You can smell that musty scent of
stored oats and grains rice
 Make a perception check
 None down here None of the rooms you were
brought through seem to have any sort of a shelf
unit or anything that carries tomes or books of
any kind unfortunately
 There doesnt seem to be very wellread
people though therere probably some Youre led
into this storage room and down a staircase
through a trapdoor Its pulled open Youre led
into this wine cellar and in the back of the wine
cellar they move aside a case shelving for wine
and theyre all resting on it some missing
others moving it there Theres a small tunnel
that you all have to duck down You have to nearly
crawl through to get your rather large firbolg form
wine
 Sure
 Youre moving pretty fast Make a perception
check
 Whatd you get
 Unfortunately you cant see any of the
labels the way its rested However you do manage
to grab a bottle of wine
 You guys are brought through singlefile
through this tunnel until eventually met with
another door The guard  does some sort
of pulsed knock It opens and from this completely
dark interior the light hits your eyes and you
have to adjust for a moment Its really not that
bright on the opposite side its still within the
forest Comparatively it hits you As you step
out there looks to be an older drunk dirty
filthylooking man who is completely sober and
lets you out
 You are now in the middle of the forest and
you can see a small bench and an overgrown well
about ten or so feet ahead and to the left of you
that vines have completely taken over The vines
themselves a similar purplegrayish color as to
the rest of the leaves A lot of the foliage seems
to fall into that same coloration Not all of it
but a lot of it It seems to cross multiple types
of vegetation As youre escorted from this room
the two guards give a nod close it behind you
The old man goes and sits back puts his bench up
against the knotted base of a thick tree thats
growing out of the ground where you had emerged
from Leans against it grabs a jug and sits and
looks at you
from here
 Make a survival check
 With how far youve traveled north it would
be straight due east from here
 You make your way through the Savalierwood
 From where you are now its probably a two
hour walk Its the far east side Its
technically past the lets see I have all the
locations here Pardon me as I pull out my notes
 Past the Gruff Slum is what it is This is
the far eastern side of it
 The Gruff Slum
 It does warm your belly and that warmth
spreads through your torso and its whenever
Jester has come and pulled you from the edge of
death with a spell its a fragment of that warmth
from the inside of your torso
 Following Keg through the wood I would like
you all to make stealth checks please
 You are no longer under the Pass without a
Trace spell
 Calebs feeling a bit clumsy but the rest
of you keeping up the slack have managed to stop
him at times and make him aware of his terrible
attempts to stay out of sight and stay quiet Two
hours of travel eastward
 Correct Two times every short rest
 About an hour into it a sound catches your
ear Keg It catches yours as well  You
hear the faint breaking of tinder and dry branch
I make a check
 Make a straight intelligence check
for anyone
 You have no idea but it sounds unique
 You hear it as well Whats your perception
Your passive perception
  Youd actually hear it as well You guys
all put your hands out stop and hold still You
see a heavy shadow moving through the dense
forest just south of where you are
 Okay Under a branch Frumpkin takes some of
the low branches of these trees underneath the
canopy and gets a look Through Frumpkins eyes
you see what looks to be a black bear but black
bears that youve seen in passing before have
been maybe eight feet ten feet end to end This
ones closer to  and about ten feet to shoulder
Its fur is long and matted almost greasy in
patches At the shoulders and the elbows and
ridges on its face you see bone protrusions like spikes
 As it comes through you watch its large
heavy almost exaggerated muscular shoulders

It sits down on the ground It seems to have
chosen a spot to take a nap
 Noise People Anything that it could eat
 Okay With that addition everyone roll
another stealth check since you are taking the
bonus there
 Is that with the plus ten
 But you do have heavy armor so you do have
disadvantage on your stealth checks I remember that
 There you go its still pretty good
 Theres the numbers
 As its sleeping the heavy breathing almost
audible as you curve around the space where it is
trying desperately to not step on anything that
would make a large snapping or shifting sound in
its presence You watch as another comes up

 Alongside it  awakens slightly and
sits down next to it and while its not sleeping
is keeping watch as it releases out of its jaw
onto the ground a very bloodied and battered body
of some person you cannot make any details of
them at this distance
 Definitely not living As you begin to walk
you begin to hear the terrible crunching sound as
its giant jaws snap into bone and tear into
flesh
 You do manage to just skirt along the side
of the bear without any notice from their side
Continuing onward The secondary hour goes without
issue but you do begin to come upon the outskirts
of your recollection of where The Sour Nest
resides Youre still a good  or so feet away
using the trees at your disposal and you can see
now the wall that matches the perimeter Its a
thin five foot wide wall with a very flimsy rail
across the top but it is a walkway for watch
guards to keep an eye out As you glance at this
distance you can see one figure thats walking
the perimeter of the top of the wall with a heavy
crossbow at the ready They stop and look out
 Its pretty dense The reason it took two
hours to get there is because youre going through
the forest Otherwise on foot in any sort of open
scenario it would take you half the time
 It looks there is manicured to be about a
tenfoot distance between the wall and any of the
surrounding trees specifically to make sure that
any sort of approaching individuals would be out
in the open You can see now a little bit of light
is coming through It looks like theyve cleared
out a bit of the canopy not entirely but a bit
of it to also prevent any lowhanging boughs or
branches to curl into the interior of the walls
Its not a massive stronghold it looks to be
approximately a little larger than the Estate
Sybaritic that you were at but its more for
function than beautiful decor A lot of the wood
seems to be old and weathered from rain and dry
seasons Its just a beige and graylooking
establishment Pure function
 Yes You can barely see it above the wall
but the little bit you can see has that visual and
you can see its a mixture of stone and wood The
edges of the actual structure are stone and then
wood is either then placed over stone or wood is
the intermediate construction material
 From this perspective you dont see where
the cart would come in
 Okay so Frumpkin makes it up Tree waits
a moment tree The one guard you see doing the
perimeter notices
 After a minute or so the guard just keeps
looking out Jumpy From Frumpkins view down
inside you can see the exterior of this There is
a large collection of brown wood kegs and a couple
of small crates that contain materials that youre
unaware of You can see there are two entrances
one at the front and one at the back of the
building There are not windows but small holes
put into the wood and from the inside Actually
roll a perception check for Frumpkin thank you
With advantage due to the form because it is
with sight
  Looking through these curved window
ports about that big essentially large enough to
look through and fire through but small enough to
not really allow a person to push through You can
see theres about two inches of stone so it is a
stone structure that has wood as a decorated
exterior to it so its pretty solid Down inside
you do see about six horses that are hitched on
the back side of it and two carts and a third one
that is currently being repaired
 Theres one up top on the wall You now see
with Frumpkin thanks to that perception roll a
secondary guard on the opposite side of the wall
It looks like there are two doing a perimeter
pass matching each other so that at any given
point in time they have a visual perspective on
one or the others side of the estate You see one
more guard that is inside the courtyard and it
looks like two individuals that are not in general
attire of the hired hands The guards are wearing
the same hooded cloak and armament as the two that
were pulling the caravan up with them
carts that Frumpkin sees are the ones that we
 They are very much The one thats been
broken has been carried along the way and
temporarily fixed for the journey but now has two
individuals of plain clothes that are in the
process of repairing the cart
 Two up top one on the inside thats armed
and two that are currently repairing the cart that
appear to be unarmed You gather from the state of
repairs that the arrival was probably not that
long before you arrived
 No there were two guards on the wall only
one you see inside the courtyard and then two
handymen You dont really know if they work for
them fulltime or if theyre a temporary hire but
there are two men that are not in the general
attire of the rest of the guards of the estate
that are currently repairing
 If you have enough
dont know how this is going to go much different
than what happened before We might need more
people
 The Grudge Gang they can be expensive and
also theyre not keen on suicide missions if they
have no stake in it But if they have a stake in
it and you pay well enough and you have
assurances and enough to back you up theyll go
with it
 Youre not sure Youve never really
interacted with them much You know of them but
because of your affiliation previously youre
pretty insulated from dealing with those folks
You grew up hating a lot of the bits of authority
that existed around here and now youre finding
yourself having to eat crow for a lifetime of
 The structure within Id say its maybe 
feet on one side maybe  or  on the other
Its hard to really gauge the full distance Its
a fairly large estate thats been fitted into a
small stronghold
 You dont know
 Frumpkin doesnt see them
 You dont see that but you know The
one thats for holding one thats for breaking
which is torture and the one that is for display
if they have any final approvals by the Jagontoth
family that has an idea of where they should be sent to
are no Iron Shepherds here
 Youve never hired any of them so youre
not sure but the way to ask would be to go find them
 On the opposite end it looks to be
ladders
 Oh sorry I thought you meant how they got
up onto the wall my apologies There is a gate in
the front and there is a gate in the back The
gate in the back is actually both gates are two
dark wood doors that have a brace set down that
holds them in place that is held and controlled
from the interior
 Solid
 On both sides it looks like a single brace
that comes down from one side
forest
 Both gates have about a tenfoot open space
before it reaches forest There are stumps and
there are places where trees were cleared out
specifically to give that opening so that theyd
have a good idea and good visual on anybody whod
attempt to approach
 You didnt work close enough with them to
know of any secret passage I mean it makes
sense There might be one but nothing that youve
come across If there is one its a wellguarded
secret You have no idea
that I can tell
 Not really Theyre not into renovations
 If it works stick with it
 They sleep on the estate Theyre paid
essentially as livein employ guards
inside
 For you its half your druid level rounded
down so per transformation its about two hours
 You can do that
son youre not going to try anything on your own
just want to get a look
 Comprehend Languages has to be spoken
languages or written language
 Green privilege Go on
 Theyre inside the courtyard yes
 Do you take your form then
 Nilas large firbolg physicality blinks down
to this tiny little field mouse What
characteristic of it do you want to stand out
 Its like a skunk mouse Like Stripe from
Gremlins All right there is Nila in mouse form
 Frumpkin moseys up to the edge of your
shoulder Looks over towards her Lands on the
ground next to you does a couple of hops up to
you
 For a brief moment you all inhale and you
see the claws have wrapped around the mouses
body Suddenly youre soaring through the air a
sensation youve never had before As Frumpkin
makes his way over into the trees make a stealth
check for Frumpkin please
 Yes
 Yes you do
 Its the best use of Prestidigitation Look
at the red light As youre soaring through the
boughs the leaves and the branches soar past the
wind past your face You get that high view of
down into the courtyard as suddenly you go into a
steep dive Within a moment youre lifted back up
and then dropped onto the ground next to one of
the barrels Frumpkin takes off The guard glances
over and is going to take a shot
 Natural five Its going to put it at a
nine Im pretty sure that doesnt hit
  Eh shit you hear
muttered over the side Seems bored and wanted to
shoot at something that looked interesting
 There you are in the courtyard now
 Its not bad Immediately glancing around
make a perception check actually as you are
coming into the courtyard
 They were in the wall of the second floor
 Of the building yes
 Its hard to see any specific areas where
you can get in other than the main doors There is
a slight gap between the front door to the
entrance and the floor of the interior Other than
that scooting around the exterior its the only
entrance you see
 Yep right at the bottom This is some Honey
I Shrunk the Kids shit now
to get a plan Nilas a little confused again
 Youre looking at the building right there
You can see the two guards going along the wall
You hear the sound of work being done on the carts
around the side and all you see is that front
door with that slight gap at the bottom What are
you doing
 Okay You scoot squeeze under flattening
out your mouse body and making your way through on
the inside The immediate warmth hits you from the
cold exterior of the forest The inside is mostly
being stone comparatively the temperature is
much warmer in here Coming inside its still a
flat stone floor Its not very well decorated at
all
 In the sense that comparatively to some
other places youve seen here its just plain
stone walls Its very basic Its so basic
Looking inside there is one curved stone
staircase that leads up to the second floor There
is a hall that goes to the left and further down
to one side There is a closed door that leads
into an interior chamber and thats all you can
see at the moment The spiral staircase up the
door ahead of you and the hall that curves around
the side
 They only go up yes
hope that it leads down
 The door or the hallway one of the two

 You squeeze beneath the door and immediately
see a general mess room There are a couple of
tables and chairs that are pressed up against
them The smell of alcohol and stale dried meat
hits your nose and you can see immediately
sitting in two of the chairs two members of The
Iron Shepherds that are in the process of eating a
midday lunch One of them is a small male
halfling He has a weasellylooking face Hes in
the process of finishing whats comparatively to
his size a large tankard of ale and eating some
sort of heavy starch biscuit meal Across from
him on the other side of the table you see a
human female barbarian with greasy curls of
blondish hair that meet with her fur shoulder and
very tattered leathers for decoration Theyre
both drinking and eating Catching off the side of
the ear the halfling is seemingly
midcomplaint about how You know it really
ticks me off that we lost some good catches on the
way up here Boss shouldntve been so careless
with that but I mean Im not going to tell him
that You know its frustrating The women
finishes a bite and a big swig of her glass
Yeah well you got to break some eggs
sometimes Like shes making some big
pontification some big statement He goes Wise
words and keeps drinking and they go into a
quiet state but theres two of them now present
You do know that at least theyve returned and
there are some present inside It does not appear
that theres any other entrance downward Theres
a secondary door on the opposite end
 Make a stealth check
 Okay You dart around the side beneath a
table beneath a bench and around the edge None
the wiser of your presence They give no shits
You make your way and squeeze past the door on the
opposite end There you come to a suiting room
There are weapons that are hung up on racks There
are a couple of small wooden poles with dowels in
the sides that are meant to hold armor shields
and things that are there additional crossbows
and things that the guards probably utilize at
different points This is an equipment storage
room There is another door to the left Where you
entered and squeezed underneath there is a door
to the left that you can go under as well As you
leave and pass that room you head to a back
hallway to this interior part of this level This
hallway continues down and seems to meet the hall
that continued around the left side and then
continues on To the right there is another door
that leads into another chamber
chamber This now I know that I didnt have to go
down that other hallway the first one because
thats already met up here right
 The other hallway would have continued this
way and the hallway youre just emerging now
meets with it Then on that right side of it
there is a door that leads into whatever room is
the next one over from that mess hall chamber You
head into that room Heading down that room its
a small closetlike room and there is a trapdoor
on the ground
now
 Make a strength check in your mouse form
 Yeah no Ill put that at a minus four
Your mouse isnt strong enough to budge the door
that is currently
 Okay make a perception check
 As youre pushing against the door you do
hear voices muffled from below Then you hear what
sounds like a laugh a deep billowing laugh
 You can And in a few days youll probably
make your way through
laugh before
 You have
theyre down there The leader of the Iron
Shepherds is down there beneath that trapdoor
Thats what I believe I dont know what to do now
 Sumalee what are you going to do
scout I am going to pull everything I have to go
away from the trap door knowing where it is and
I am going to scurry up and I want to explore that
spiral staircase
 Youre heading back into the crosshallway
Are you following down the hall or are you heading
back through the mess room
 Okay you scurry around the hallway There
is nobody in there so there is no one you are
trying to hide from You make it back to the main
entryway head to the staircase and it takes you
awhile to get up there because the steps are
about that high each Its a little jump and then
you miss a few and have to stop and skitter back
up It takes you awhile the better part of about
 to  minutes You eventually make your way to
the second floor Up there you can see another
hallway and as opposed to the bottom floor which
had an Lshaped hallway that went around this one
has a perimeter hall There are those porthole
windows that are carved into the stone two on
each side As you come up to the top the hall
goes around and theres a central chamber on the
inside or chambers if theyre divided You can
see immediately on the second floor a door
directly available to the one thats just north of
you You dont see any other door on this
particular corridor
 You scoot beneath that door and inside
there you can see a number of beds You see four
different beds that are lined up You also find a
urine of other mice
 You glance over and in the corner you can
see one of the comforters that has been partially
eaten and pulled down and tugged There is a
slight hole in the stone on the edge You can
distinctly smell that there are other mice that
live in this space
 You dont necessarily know if they are in
the beds at all Theres nobody in the beds
Sorry Yeah nobody on the beds
 No not in this room
cover everything and gather as much of the layout
 Well say as you move into one of the other
rooms the next two you do notice that there are
two other chambers This upper floor is divided
into three different chambers There is the wide
one that has the four beds theres one that has
two other beds and theres one that has a
singular large bed This one room is almost like a
master bedroom You gather this is probably the
room that Lorenzo sleeps in Its a wider bed It
has of all the other middling elements of
comfort this one comparatively is more extravagant
more comfortable The layers of cushions
 Goddamn it Sam Make a perception check
 You look up and there is a makeshift table
on the side of the bed and a stone platter that
sits on there and the remains of a meal The
smell in here is old and slightly decayed like
something had died You glance up and you can see
some a bit of graying flesh and a faint glisten of white
closer
 Okay There is an edge of the bed that you
can eventually scurry up and use that to climb up
onto the bed itself The bed is bowed pretty
heavy The actual bed was wide whatever weight
its carried from Lorenzo is sunken rather deep in
there Its a bit of a pit as you crawl across it
the blankets tossed and folded over You make your
way to the edge and look over to this platter and
what you see appears to be bones Bones that are
covered in strips and elements of leftover meat
 There is a skull A tiny skull
 Not animal
but Im going to hold it together I want to get
out now
 You make your way down off the side of the
bed and into the hallway and begin to turn around
towards the staircase down As you begin to
descend the staircase you hear heavy footsteps
making their way towards the base of the stairs
 You hear the shifting of
leather Make a stealth check with the mouses
dexterity which
the mouse than with Nila
 What did you roll
 Go ahead Use that luck point


 Oh yeah no I know Im so thankful
because as you come down the staircase you see
looming up towards the muscled form of a tired
but intent to peruse his domain Lorenzo making
his way up the same staircase No glaive in his
hands As you step up you manage to wait for the
right moment hiding in the shadow of the step As
his legs cross over you dart down to make your
way and he doesnt see a thing You make your way
back down into the main entryway to this back out
under the main entrance under the door You are
now in the courtyard You head on over to the barrels
me
 Frumpkin has kept watch specifically sees
the mouse return Darts down and snatches you up
in your form and swoops up Make a stealth check
for Frumpkin The same guard is getting slightly
  He glances over and sees Frumpkin dart
down and goes I got ya
 However stillI mean good for you
 Still a natural two Another bolt goes off
Frumpkin goes up into the trees back down to you
guys They are waiting patiently watching as the
owl returns and on the ground releases the mouse
form of Nila
 She is still a mouse
 If she wants to
mouse form
 Okay
 Ill have an actual sketch for you next
time
 Until nightfall Id say with the twohours
travel from the morning youd have probably
another six seven hours
 If you are heading straight south to the
town its maybe another hour Well actually a
little less than that
 All right I will need both stealth checks
from all of you
 Youre disadvantaged with your stealth
check
get much worse than that
 As you are having this discussion what you
can only amount to be like a large pile of pots
being dropped onto the ground Keg gets her foot
caught right underneath a nearby tree root and
just  onto the ground
Glancing over you immediately see that one guard
that was shooting at Frumpkin go like Hey hey
hey hey
 Heading southward to town or where are you
doing
 All right and you guys go running as fast
as you can towards town

 Charging through the Savalierwood to find
what hopeful aid or fortune you can And thats
where we will end tonights session
 Well done guys
more

 All right We will pick up on that next
Thursday with both Sumalee and Ashly
 Missed an opportunity
 Anyway thank you guys Amazing job
Sumalee amazing

 Thank you guys for coming along with us For
those of you who we will see at ComicCon we will
see you there If not you will see our panel on
Tuesday in place of Talks Machina so you can get
caught up In the meantime just know that we love
you Have a wonderful weekend and is it Thursday
yet Good night

 Welcome back everyone Last we left off
The Mighty Nein who had acquired two new allies
in Keg the dwarven fighter and Nila the firbolg
druid had made their way to the city of
Shadycreek Run After making your way through the
town spending an evening staying at the
Landlocked Lady and getting some information
about where to find info about your quarry and
where your friends may have been taken to after
they were captured by the Iron Shepherds a
traveling slavers crew
 They are the worst You went and had a
discussion at the Estate Sybaritic with Ophelia
Mardun of whom you were sent by The Gentleman to
interface with and do a deed for her a little over
two weeks ago There it seemed that the intent of
your job placed here in this city has aligned with
your current goal of freeing your friends and
seeking vengeance against the Iron Shepherds as
they currently work for a competitive family to
the Mardun house and in response to them
destroying parts of the trade route that the
Mardun family enjoys through the center and
southern sides of the empire they wish you to
instill damage upon their traders as well by
eliminating the Iron Shepherds You were given
some ideas as to where you might find some help
you gathered your things made your way north into
the seemingly corrupted and haunted Savalierwood
to seek information about these Iron Shepherds and
where they are You narrowly avoided two large
immensely mutated bonespurred bear creatures
You sought out and cased the exterior of the Sour
Nest which is the fortress that was given to the
Iron Shepherds by the family that pays them and
keeps them in their employ You decided to send
your new druid friend Nila in the form of a
small mouse over the wall delivery via owl She
snuck through some portions of the fortress to
gather intel and to get an idea of where you were
going and what may reside within A few close
calls and some discovery of what can be expected
within the interior you made your way back
safely to join your friends
 Upon accidentally spooking one of the outer
guards who were walking the perimeter of the wall
that surrounds the Sour Nest you immediately
picked up what you had fled south back through
the Savalierwood on your way to Shadycreek Run to
look for means of possibly finding more help for
this endeavor when nightfall hits and whatever
else you can do to prepare for the necessary
evacuation of your allies And thats where we
left off Mighty Nein as youve charged back
through the purplishgray corrupted Savalierwood
the midday sun barely visible through slight
peaking cracks through the canopy above you
leaping and hearing these large growling sounds
and hoots you beeline it as best you can and as
quickly as you can before you breach into the
outskirts of the northern side of the North Clover
area Youre now between some of the nearby
buildings and you immediately begin to see some
of the relatively shady denizens of this north
side of Shadycreek Run that glance over their
shoulder their hooded selves watching you as you
pass You slow your gait as you are no longer
fleeing per se but you have made your way back
to the town What would you like to do
 At this point it would be midday a little
bit in the afternoon
 Yes The Grunge Gang The Grudge Gang
which the Taskers are a part of it
 Grudge
 Vice versa The Grudge Gang is the
overarching loose network of mercenaries that
sell swords and do not affiliate directly with any
of the other political powers Theyre all just
outside of the system within the town The Taskers
are a small subsect of the Grudge Gang that have
taken it upon themselves to keep the peace to a
certain extent
 Well you dont know Youve had some
experience here The Taskers best that you can
surmise you havent had a lot of dealings with
them they are probably in the neighborhood of 
to  people They are not a massive group by any
means and theyre stretched a little thin but
because a lot of them have friends within the
Grudge Gang and people theyve worked with
before they can usually call upon friends if need
be especially if they have some coin to their
side and they have a specific endeavor they need
to do
 Correct
down the motherfucking house
 Its mostly stone
 Theres elements of wood from a decoration
standpoint but for the most part its a stone structure
 Lorenzo felled by a brown recluse
 Well thats our next merch piece there
 Nope
 They may have it there yeah You havent
had to acquire gold dust before but if you were
to ask around you could see if theres some place
in the vicinity that might carry it
  gold
 Travel on foot is about roughly four to six
hours depending on how well you can make your way
through the terrain
 Its like two in the afternoon yeah
 Yeah she mentioned a Blooming Grove
 Youve not necessarily heard of The Blooming
Grove Roll a history check actually
 Thats not too bad Youve vaguely heard of
The Blooming Grove but its not referred to that
very often Its more referred to do as The Bone
Orchard
 Yeah you havent been there but from what
you know its this strange ancient gravesite
thats been on the outskirts of town a few miles
out since before the town was built
Shadycreek Run to be wackadoos Or are they
 From what you know from what youve heard
everyone thinks theyre strange creepy hermits
and possibly witches No one really goes there
Some folk in here tend to put on the air of not
being superstitious but the Savalierwood carries
a lot of superstition with it Some folks while
they may play it off still seem to get a little
nervous about delving too deep into it
lives in the Savalierwoods then theyre not weak
Theres a lot of crazy shit in the woods so they
must be able to hold their own or at least remain discrete
 You have no idea
 Pushing past two to three in the afternoon
 Four to six hours depending on how well you
travel
 Thats walking Your horse isnt going to go
any faster than you in the middle of this very
clustered forest Theres no path that leads to
it
 All right
 Everyone has their Fitbits attuned
 First off whats your marching order
please
 You can take them with you
 Because its like a thick wood
 Okay Whos up front Whos in the back
Whos guiding what
going Should I be in front Or have I never been to this
 It depends Whoever wants to guide this will
be taking the survival checks to lead you through
So who wants to be making
 Thats a good call
 Whos behind or near Caleb
 All right so Kegs holding up the back
Beau in the middle
 There you go Ill put Frumpkin there next
to okay
 Taking this moment now you begin to head
back away from Shadycreek and helming this group
of ragtag adventures youve under your wing You
tread into an area of the Savalierwood youve not
traveled before hoping that your instincts your
smell bag and the spirit of what nature has
managed to maintain itself through this corrupted
wood could guide you properly to your destination
I need you to make a survival check please
just smelling
 Ten okay You still have your Luck feat if
you want to unless you want to save it
 You have two more points left
like to use one Luck point
 One more Luck point
  okay
 Not only do you swiftly manage to find the
portions of the wooded paths that are least
blockaded by thorny brambles and fallen
halfrotted trees but you also manage to help the
party avoid a few small openings that look
uniquely and uncomfortably welcoming In the midst
of a wood like this you know from your experience
as well that it is not always a good idea to step
where it seems most inviting when you know the
wood around you to be less so
 As you crest around the second of these open
groves you notice how the ground itself seems to
shift slightly and you watch as for a moment it
seems to almost pit as elements of the dirt suck
inward You know the antlion funnels that appear
in the sand and begins to come in towards them
The ground almost seems to sink in for a second
before righting itself The grove stands flat once
more but thankfully due to the survival
instincts of your firbolg leader you manage to
careen past two of these patches without issue
Pushing on at a fairly intense speed within three
and a half hours not even the full four
 You manage to make your way to an area where
the color notably changes ahead of you The
somewhat still purplegray color that suffuses
most of the natural landscape within the
Savalierwood gives way to a patch of green in the
distance This is the first sign that calls forth
that warm sensation you got when you had checked
this path within your smell bag As the rest of
you begin to gather up behind Nila the closer you
get you begin to watch as these winter trees that
comprise most of this northern forest give way to
green oaks and swampbased plant life The
temperature as you get to a certain threshold
begins to be not quite as biting cold slightly
warmer with each step Looking around immediately
the first thing that catches your eye is this
large wall of tangled vine and thorns The same
purplishgray color The green is still ahead of
you Do you guys want to continue on Anything you
want to do
 It looks like a natural wall that curls up
about five or so feet
 In your way yes
 Make a perception check
 A little ways off it seems to dip a bit
Maybe about  feet or so to the northern side of
it Youve been traveling northwest to reach this
part of the forest
 You can see over it a bit as theres only
about five or so feet most places As you get a
little bit closer you can see areas where these
tangle of vines are pulled apart or have entirely
enclosed and you see longrusted wrought iron
bars a fence of some kind A boundary that was
placed long ago that has since been slowly taken
back by nature You then begin to see that area of
the wall that you had noticed Nott that had
seemed to be bending and the vines have actually
curled over and bent it downward It seems that
whatever this little section of the forest is
whatever protective magics that once contained
this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the
corruption of the Savalierwood
 Okay make a perception check for Frumpkin
with advantage because it is still in the owl form
 Frumpkin darts up jumping from tree edge to
tree edge gliding through There are numerous
layers of similar walls Three different layers
looks like Whereas the outskirts or the perimeter
of this beautiful protected ancient gravesite
that once held this corruption at bay has slowly
collapsed inward and a new boundary is placed
Then that boundary has fallen As the corruption
pulls in further a new boundary is built That
third boundary now seems to be in the process of
giving in just like its previous constructs
Within this third area you can see not just a
lack of snow or ice or the winter chill but a
nearly humid summer warmth something more akin to
the southern tip of the Empire or even Menagerie
Coast It is an unexpected and extreme shift in
temperature and weather There is something
unnatural or at least magical that maintains
this little pocket of untouched paradise There
you can see small pools bits of bog where the
soft green and browns of compost fall into green
thick algaecovered bits of water You can see
dozens and dozens of stone tablets about a foot
to two feet high with bits of script across them
too far to see that have partially fallen or
leaning At which point Frumpkin looks around and
this entire area from the outer very edge where
that first perimeter wall was found to the inside
has all been graves most taken back by the
Savalierwood as it slowly crushes whatever this
location is at its source On the far end towards
the core and the back the northern side of this
final defending pocket of uncorrupted forest
you can see a stone building maybe  by  feet
built as an old stone steeple It stands
windowless open and the floor of it to each open
window overgrown with green vine and leaf
 Frumpkin is about  to  feet from you
 Yeah
 Frumpkin begins to return and a passing of
one of the clouds gives more sunlight that breaks
through what was previously a very dense gray
sky As the light passes between the small breaks
in the tree canopies the green comes to light
with color numerous types of color A rainbow of
flowers of pigments youve never really seen
before begin to emerge as the light hits it
Nearly every inch of these gravesites contain a
smattering scatter of rainbow colors across petal
and stamen
 You saw maybe a few frogs small natural
creatures that exist within this space but
nothing that would resemble a human yet It seems
still
 You can certainly try
 The areas where the fence has been pushed in
is between five to six feet in places areas where
it seems to be pushed down lower to about four to
even three and a half
not
 Yeah You guys could attempt to climb and
leap over Elements of it are thorned and jagged
 Make an investigation check
 Thats fair It takes you a few minutes and
you find a couple of softer pieces of branch and
vine that have fallen to the corruption Its
interesting you touch them and theyre supple
like vines but theyre gray and freezing to the
touch Its a very weird unnatural feeling but
it seems supple
 Make a nature check
 Youve studied and seen within the vicinity
of where you grew up and where your clan had
raised you and your children numerous types of
disease and natural means of plant life succumbing
to illness or an outside force What you can tell
is that this is not natural This is not some
naturally formed blight There is some much older
and much more powerful latent reasoning for this corruption
territory but does someone want to throw me
 You lean them up against it and slowly they
bow over
 All right Make a perception check
 As you carefully place your hands across the
elements of vine and root you manage to keep a
keen glance for any sort of bladed thorned or
hooked elements that protrude from the local
fauna You manage to avoid any of them from
catching your coat catching your flesh and step
leaping over to the opposite side without issue
 Youre just going to dash over Make an
acrobatics check
 Caleb has shown areas as he passed over
where you can safely climb The rest of you dont
need to make checks Nott ignores this entirely
and goes leaping and flipping and attempting to
make her way over The actual fence bends slightly
at the impact of foot the iron beneath having
wilted due to longform rust and whatever
perpetual weight has been placed upon it from this
land attempting to reclaim it from underneath
Nott leaps double flip in the air lands on the
opposite side skids a bit as your feet hit a
slight bit of the icy floor but you manage to
catch yourself no issue
 Each of you make your way over this element
of the forest continuing on past the next two
boundaries eventually making your way into the
central area of the Blooming Grove The term now
striking a bell as you look around and can see
these beautiful flowers as the sun rays hit and
pass Its like the color flares up once the light
hits it and then seems to gray as it passes on
You now stand temperature much warmer and
theres just that stone structure ahead
 From where youre standing on the interior
of it about  or so feet
 Make an investigation check
 Looking through there are a few languages
that come through most of them are elven and they
are very old Some of them appear to be  
 years old Whatever individuals or
families or bloodlines have been interred in this
space have been placed here for a very long time
until recently
 You do see one that appears to be maybe
about ten years old Very faint elements of wear
and tear
 The name on that one would be Elvish and it
would be Tyriel Casala
 Casala
 She knows Elvish but she doesnt really
speak it often so the pronunciations get a little weird
 There is a door yes
 The door itself is maybe four feet wide
its a single door Its an old wood the bottom
half of it is green with growing moss and other
bits of vegetation that are set in to the
relatively damp wood that its constructed from
The top seems to be split and warped a little bit
over time due to the moisture in the air
 Okay make a stealth check
 Make a perception check
 Best you can see no Its pretty well made
The walls and the roof all appear to be made from stone
 There are windows You can only really see
the front and right side of it the southeast side
of it from your perspective there is a single
window It is an arched window that looks like it
may have been built at one point to hold glass or
stained glass but it is no longer there You can
see the soft junglelike flora at the base of it
has swooped up and grown over and into the
interior of the structure Best you can tell from
this distance there is no visible light
immediately inside but there is a bit of natural
light that is coming in through the open space
 Sure roll a stealth check
 Okay You begin to dart across the open
space dodging through gravestones and as youre
passing one of them there is a bit of a thorned
vine that catches the back of your cloak It pulls
taut before you get yanked on your neck slip
back and Nott slams on the ground giving a little sound
 Theres a brief pause all of you hold in
silence hearing a distant bird that goes quiet
the wind passing through the trees You hear the
wooden door begins to slowly open as a shaded
figure steps beyond the frame Taliesin if you
want to step in

 Finally 
 Would you like to describe what they see
emerge from this small stone temple
 Okay
 Make an insight check
 
 There doesnt seem to be any threat at the
moment
 You actually have not You would have no
idea
 Its a chitinouslooking metal breastplate
that has a somewhat pearlescent turquoise
greenblue tint to it that seems to shift in the
light
 All right Making your trek back to the
forest Are you helming this as well
 Caduceus are you wanting to help Or Nila
I think is asking for your help in fording this
forest as you have a little more experience
 So make your survival check with advantage
  and a 
 Its up to you guys
 
 Go ahead and roll damage
 Well you double the dice that you rolled
 You take  points of piercing damage
Beau
 Okay go for it
 Roll a d
 I think so Is that what it says right
there
 It goes for right underneath where the
clavicle and the neck meet and catches it right there
 Thats right
 You have to roll to attack
 Go ahead and roll damage on that one
 What happens is you pull back to fire and
as it gets ready to go ahead and extend it looks
like another bolt slips up into it accidentally
and it fires two in a row Beau catches one and is
like Ugh ow and theres a second one thats
jammed right into the space between two ribs
 Yeah its a d plus your wisdom modifier
The wound seems to close as you watch this
 You go up by six You watch as this bright
redpink colored lichen mossy material seems to
come out of the wound and close it and then turn
gray break away and crumble off Where it is
the wound seems to have closed and healed over
like weeks of healing have gone by
 In making your journey back toward
Shadycreek Run the sun does set part way through
your journey The forest goes dark nearly pitch
black Now I believe all of you but Caleb have
some sort of darkvision At this point the
crickets start coming out very loudly the distant
sound of skittering and animal movements through
brush and dry leaves catch the outside of your
peripheral You manage to stop every now and then
as Nila puts her hand up listening and smelling
for anything nearby Are you guys continuing at a
fast pace or are you attempting to be stealthy
 Thats true Are you guys heading back to
Shadycreek or are you heading straight to the
Sour Nest
 Itll add an hour or so to go into
Shadycreek Essentially this is Shadycreek Run at
the bottom of the forest and youve traveled from
your perspective far northwest to get to the area
where you met Caduceus Youre now heading back
down and the Sour Nest is on the northeastern side
of the city just outside of it so you have to
scoot and ricochet off
 No you could go straight to it through the
forest but it depends on what you want to do If
youre going straight there or if youre wanting
to skim through Shadycreek its your choice
 The sun set With that roll you made youll
 Okay so you head straight to The Sour Nest
All right Over the next couple of hours you make
your way scooting as opposed to the more southern
direction you were traveling heading eastward
Carefully making your way on the outskirts of the
northern side of North Clover of Shadycreek Run I
need you all to make stealth checks
 Disadvantage for you Keg unfortunately
 Okay Roll a wisdom check
 Wisdom check
 You bend in quietly placing your hand
against one of the nearby trees the bark being
cold and somewhat soft from the moisture of the
snow that had melted from the day before You feel
the oppressive sense of the central nature that
encompasses the Savalierwood give way ever so faintly
talk to plants Plants are neutral What if we
lead them into the woods
 Best that you can tell hes not a leave no
man behind type individual
 He is not
 Hes definitely a fan of an eye for an eye
of them he might chase us
 Stealth checks
 Okay
 Thanks to you speaking with nature I am
ignoring one of the lowest stealth rolls
 Even still you approach the outskirts of
The Sour Nest The clouds of the night are broken
here and there the very darkened night
occasionally broken by the errant moonbeam that
manages to sweep through the open grove where this
fortress was built The canopy itself cleared out
leaving it open for the occasional peek of white
through the clouds The same perimeter wall you
see being slowly trained across by two guards
dressed in the same hooded attire as those that
you previously saw As you saw as well bringing
the three carts northward from the Glory Run Road
As you begin to approach Keg unfortunately
manages to step on a hornets nest It crunches
under your foot and for a brief second you
inhale very sharply knowing this familiar sound
This is not the first hornets nest youve stepped
into Thankfully a moment passes no hornets It
was abandoned and had fallen from a tree However
you do hear a voice on the wall say Hello
 About  feet from you
  Oh there you are again you
sucker Hes going to raise a crossbow again

 That is a  to hit What is Frumpkins
armor class as an owl
 That is four points of piercing damage to
Frumpkin
 How many hit points does the owl have
 So its five This owl takes a crossbow bolt
to the chest and is like  You hear the
same voice go Fucking hell What Phil I
fucking shot an owl its still flying I hate
this forest Its bullshit You hear this voice a
little further away go  You suck
Hes like Shut up Loads another bolt into it
and starts You see now is actively looking for
the owl to finish it off and regain his pride
 Make a perception check with advantage
 Yeah
  Okay Hearing the two men banter back
and forth a little bit the errant prodding that
Phil seems to be giving to this individual Beyond
that theres the crickets in the air theres
other nocturnal birds that are starting to rouse
from their slumber to go hunting for the night
From the direction of The Sour Nest Frumpkin
glances up and can see on the second floor there
are two openings you had seen previously on the
second floor of this fortress on each side and
there appears to be a very faint bit of firelight
and a shadow that passes by one the other so
there is somebody moving on the second floor of
this
 Of the inside of it yes
 All right Very wounded but alive
 Frumpkin happily eats from the goodberries
 Yeah the wounds close slowly the magic of
the goodberries healing the crossbow bolt over eventually
 Id say at this point its close to 

 The wall is about  to  feet Its not
terribly tall Its about five feet wide
 You do know from previously looking over
it that theyve cleared out the forest about ten
feet from the outer wall specifically to prevent
anyone from climbing over into the space
 They are yes
 Okay You guys wait an hour to get into
position
 Okay you keep an out and you do watch as
the two of them Theyre not perfectly in line
with each other and the second floor of the
complex does block their vision of each other when
they are on complete opposite sides of the wall
But sometimes one of them will be faster than the
other and theyll yell to the other and theyll
go see each other from the opposite sides
 How far is Beauregard from you right now
 You do know from the time that youve spent
here that there is no point in which the place is
unguarded from the wall
 Meaning there are shifts The perimeter
sentinels that you see currently there are
usually two sets that switch off
 There is but youre not entirely certain
when it was You werent really paying attention
 Its a lot of armor
 You guys can take a short rest
 And you watch
 Mercifully depending on your intent the
clouds break for a while and you have a clear
starry moonlit sky overhead that manages to
create a rimlight on both the wall the
structure and the two guards And you wait And
you wait And were going to take a break
 Well come back here in a second At this
point might as well put the fortress out there
so thatll be waiting for you when you come back
 You finally found him Were going to go to
break here for a bit but we have our giveaway at
the break For our fantastic giveaway tonight we
have the purpleheart hero vault with the Celtic
knot design on it which is really pretty Its

 A little late on the draw there but that
worked out That was awesome Welcome back
everybody Before we jump into this we have our
winner of the fantastic purpleheart hero
vault Thats going to be Elmosdaddy
Congratulations Elmosdaddy Well get your
information and get that out to you ASAP
 To give you a little bit of a visual
representation of the size of the base of the fortress
 Thats what you see within the interior of
the courtyard The wall itself resides probably
about out here
 This is inside the wall
 Above that still
 Theres a second floor
 The second floor sits right about there To
give a little bit of perspective on that The
black dots on the outside by the way are where
the windows are visible on the stone You guys are
currently divided on opposite ends of the outer
wall watching the two guards slowly move their way
around the perimeter
 Not yet
 All righty
floor at all
 No No windows in the bottom floor There is
a front double door and there is a single door in
the back that you know leads into a kitchen
 Its a pretty big spider
 Thats a four or five hitter
 Shortly after midnight you watch as two
figures ascend from the inside of the wall
climbing up different ladders that mark the
entrance and exit They both interface in a brief
conversation hushed voices and then relieve the
two previous guards who then descend down on the
inside of the courtyard via those same ladders and
disappear into The Sour Nest fortress So there
has been a guard changeover now Its past
midnight pushing one in the morning What would
you like to do
 Much like how you spend a moment with your smell
bag you watch as Beauregard seems to focus into
this strange vibrant pink satchel or shoulder bag
that Caleb has been carrying
 About a minute passes before Beauregard
pulls back away this strange trance passing over her
 Seven to seven and a half feet
 Unfortunately you guys are on the opposite
sides of this
 Yes
 The two groups would be probably on the
outskirts of the wall here and here
 Quite a distance
 About  feet
 Well say you can manage to adjust
yourselves to get within range
 Make a perception check  Pardon me
 One of them is human though maybe  
feet tall The other because of the moonlight
thats coming through you have a better
perspective on him even at this distance you
guess probably halfelven or just a very thin
human A little over foot So you have a foot
one and one thats   feet
 Battleoptimal position
 First I need you to make a stealth check
because youre having to move right up against the
wall This is a tenfoot clearing
 Both of you guys roll stealth checks
 It is a plus ten to stealth check
 Whats your total
Trace
 No you have one because you used one last
game
 Its a long rest to come back
 So  and  Youre throwing a javelin and
youre firing
 You both run up to the wall You go ahead
and hoist up hanging on the edge right there
Walks past doesnt seem to have noticed the both
of you
 Rolled a six on his perception Would you
both make your attack rolls please Because you
are unseen you have advantage on the attack
 That just hits
 It was with advantage Roll again just in
case you want to crit
 No not at all Lets roll your sneak attack
damage and double it on top because its a crit
and then take another shot
  points of damage from the first attack
Go ahead and roll damage for the javelin
 Its  damage As you throw the javelin up
you get your shot the next attack
 Roll damage for that one
 You watch as  and you
yank back Make a strength check
  Youre dragging the corpse
 Handoverhand youre dragging the corpse
He instadies and then got pulled off and then
slammed onto the ground and is now being pulled
through the dirt and grass Done instantly For
you its a wisdom saving throw
 A natural  plus one thats  its a
fail
 Yes
 Easy enough to do Go ahead and make a
martial arts attack Technically you have
advantage because hes paralyzed
 Yep
 That hits its an autocrit because hes
held Roll your martial arts damage
 Six damage You throw him to the ground He
falls and takes an additional five points of
bludgeoning damage After the fall hits the
ground off the wall on the backside of it hes
now face down on the ground still held
 Are you continuing your attack with her or
are you hanging staying up on the wall
 Okay Go ahead and swing the attack You
have advantage because hes paralyzed and prone
 Yep Go ahead and roll that twice and take
the higher adding your wisdom modifier
 Plus your proficiency modifier which is
plus three so it would be
 That hits Go ahead and roll your damage
Should be a
 d plus four But d times two because its
critical
 Well its oh thats fine well do that
So thats nine add the two together its nine
plus four So  points of damage on top of that
Right as youre slamming down go ahead and make
your next attack
 With advantage these are with advantage
because hes paralyzed and prone
 Go ahead and roll damage crit
  points of damage Yeah thatll do it
 Both of them one was enjoying the wind and
then darkness forever The other got a cramp and
then got bludgeoned from all sides after being
jammed in the dirt and then expired
forever Aw thats so sad Was it Phil
 It was the end of The Sopranos for them
man It was just
switched Phils still alive We should only leave
Phil alive if we can just save Phil
 Hashtag save Phil
 They are both done at the moment it is
silent There is a very slight sound of both their
bodies impacting in the dirt but youre not sure
if that managed to reach as far as anybody within
the interior of the stronghold What do you do now
in this moment
 Cool no worries
can you make it there yourself
 Its about  feet You might want to help
him hes not the strongest person Just make a
strength check Its not too difficult
 Yeah You  you get on top of the
wall you have the cloak on
 Between your acrobatics and your ability
your height without an issue you get to the top
You guys now are on top of the wall cloaked
Where do you want to go
 Perception check with advantage please
windows on the second story now
 If they want to they can try
 Okay There does not appear to be any person
in the courtyard Those two guards are the only
two that were currently set on the outside You
can see the horses that were pulling the carts
that are set over on the side at the moment You
can see the carts that have since been repaired
and are currently waiting in rest You can see the
front door to the stronghold and you can see the
back door
 Youre still on the outside of the wall
 You have to make your way through the
perimeter of the wall which has its own front
gate which is closed Do you want to head to
that
 The outer wall and out that way okay Cast
Detect Magic
 Correct
 Easy enough to do
 As you give the Deuce your nod you watch as
his form actually shifts smaller and matches the
shape of the previous guard
 Finishing your Detect Magic you do not
detect anything magical of the outer gate It is locked
entrancefront entrance
 Okay Make an investigation check because
youre doing this quickly
  Not too bad
 You manage to pilfer about  gold pieces
 Yes
 Because you caught him at the moment outside
of the town and he had his money on him
 No keys on him no
 He felt safe on that wall
 The crossbow that he had seems to have
snapped in the process of his body being yanked
from the top of the wall His armor is standard
leather armor
 You didnt stop to check youre already up
on the wall
 If you want to Make an investigation
check
  okay You find  gold pieces
 And a pack of crossbow bolts  crossbow
bolts
 Id like you both to roll stealth check with
disadvantage
 Disadvantage for her because of her armor
 Okay  good to know
 Youre going stealth as well Roll a stealth
check please
 You do so thats plus ten
 Okay Eventually the four of you meet
towards the front gate seemingly from what you
can tell no ones noticed
 Make a perception check
 Okay
 Okay you see nobody else inside the
courtyard You occasionally see the flickering
movement It looks like firelight is the source of
light thats coming through the two windows on the
two sides of the facility you can see No movement
yet
 Make a perception check
 Okay you feel like you have a pretty good
eye on those two sides of the interior windows
You do not see any movement yet but youre pretty
locked on What are the four of you guys doing now
that youve met at the front gate
 Yes
 Thats your dexterity modifier plus your
proficiency modifier
 All right yeah
  okay You take a moment and there are
two specific locks that are chained one on each
side that are closed The one thats nearest to
you easy enough The one on the opposite side
you have to pull out one of your metallic hooks
that slips through a space in the wood and manage
to pull it up on the side a little bit Youre
essentially reversepicking it with two hooked
picks from the opposite side It takes you a
little longer until eventually it hangs
 You guys are over there
 Youre making your way into the courtyard
now
 This door or this door Your choice
 Thats the front
 Technically Beau you guys are walking
perimeter on the outside wall The rest of you
cats are currently essentially over that way
You guys have just passed through the gate on that
side where its open and allowing you into the
courtyard
 Youre still focusing as you come inside
 Yeah no magic that you notice on the front
door of the fortress
 For the duration each creature you choose
within  feet of you
 It doesnt say at the moment of casting you
have to select just that for the duration you
choose So my interpretation I would allow
someone to step into the radius and you could
then choose
 All right everyone whos now making their
way around the back make another stealth check
 Youre still at disadvantage because you
still have your armor
 Okay You guys begin to head around this
direction
 All right Going past the barrel pile where
you had previously made your way in and out via
owl the previous day As you guys scoot past you
hear the front door of the facility 
 It opens ever so faintly to the
inside and a figure peers out having apparently
heard something
 You see a figure poke the head out and look
curiously
 What Make a deception check with
advantage given that fact that its in the
darkness and not an unexpected scenario
 Guard looks past and closes the door
this game
 You guys all continue to the back of the
facility
 You guys are at the back door
 The door seems to be clear of magic
 From what you can look at it looked to be
humanoid it was hard to tell at this distance
with the little bit of firelight you saw Hood was
down Short black hair looked a bit sallow
Young but probably looked older than they were
 Nah that would have been cool
 I should have run with it Youre at the
back door
 There is a very faint bit that a spider
could fit though yes
 All right Frumpkin is now up and there is
a kitchen
 There is a kitchen you can see there is an
oven There looks to be a bunch of dirty dishes
that have just piled up and havent been washed in
a while There is a path that goes to the right
and further down this hallway and there is a door
that leads further in
 Okay Thats through into this hallway
which currently ends in two more doors This way
and that way
 They are loose I mean as far as small
gaps in between very very tiny
 Yep
go
 He wouldnt be able to hear you
 Which one Theres two different doors This
way or this way
 All right Frumpkin moves into this chamber
which unveils this chamber In this chamber you
see a dining area of some kind and you see there
are two of the hired guards in the process of
finishing an evening drink
 One of them is Phil One of them is the
other guy Looks like theyre having a nightcap
 Theyve been drinking You have no idea if
theyre drunk Frumpkin sees the two of them
hushedly chatting to one other and drinking from
tankards
 Okay Make a stealth check for Frumpkin
because now you are in eyesight of
 I know
 What did you roll
 Thats fine They do not see Fumpkin They
have had just enough to drink where they did not
see Frumpkin
 Frumpkin is going where
 Okay That leads into another chamber a
hallway that continues down and then seems to
open into another walkway
 Frumpkin goes and opens that one which
leads into another hallway a very small chamber
and there are a couple of odd pieces of dried
goods in the corners and a wooden trapdoor
 Seems to be a trapdoor
 No
 That is a wall yes
 On the wall over here
 Okay Revealing that It looks and you can
see this has been storage Because Frumpkin
entered this is all kitchen storage and looking
down this hall
 That is the gist of what youve seen
 You dont know how much of this will stay
 Turning around this way you can see the
spiral staircase the very same where you had
briefly managed to dodge Lorenzo earlier in the
day heading up to the second floor
 Right as Frumpkin passes that way this door
opens up and one of the two guards heads this
way A little sloppy but turns and
 Ew He starts walking up and goes in to
try and step on Frumpkin
 Yeah whats Frumpkins armor class
 With disadvantage Thats  It goes ahead
and stomps down Thats a hit point
 Whats the speed for Frumpkin
 Okay The guard is like Ugh Hey Phil

 What Whats the problem Theres a
fucking spider in here
 Heads back into the room and comes back with
these two metal tankards that are dinged up and
they both start throwing them up to try and smash
the spider With that the first one misses and
 down the stairs
 Well the first two slams or tossing of
tankards clanging loudly do not hit
 They both turn around and follow like
Where did it go Its this way and they both
come back inside the room trying to follow where
Frumpkin went
 They both look around like Shit Ugh I
cant sleep now with that thing around here Keep
looking Thats the last thing that Frumpkin
hears before vanishing
 Make a perception check
 Youre listening right now You dont hear
anything but youre also on the opposite side of
where anybody else would be So you have no idea
 Are you drinking to the point of
intoxication
 All righty
 All right
 Make an investigation check on the door
  The door is indeed locked
 Go ahead and roll for that Plus six
 Thats still enough anyways
 What did you roll
 No You fear breaking one of your lockpicks
you remove it
 As you guys are having this conversation
you see Caleb flicker his hands through the air
his eyes focused in a distant stare for a moment
You see this strange blue energy sparkle around
the outside of the doorknob and the door opens
 Youre still keeping tabs on it Im not
going to have you roll just for consistently staring
 Okay you do see a shadow pass by the door
by the window
 Okay What do you do
 To the right is a hallway an open entrance
that goes into a pantry or storage room To the
left is a door that leads beyond the kitchen
 Youre at a door
 It opens its not locked
 You feel a tickle
 Make a stealth check please because youre
now passing within ear shot of
 Okay As you turn the corner part of your
cloak seems to have caught the edge of one of the
pots that was layered on the table right here As
you pull through pots start clattering You guys
watch as this whole stack of pots start pulling
off into the kitchen The door here swings open
and both of these figures come rushing in Hey
what the hell They both pull out blades
 All right roll initiative you guys
 All righty  to 
 What do you mean
 You guys would have heard it very faintly
Because the door was open and it did fill what
was normally a pretty still evening That brings
us to them All right That brings us to  to 
  all right Nott all right  to ten
 All right I think thats everyone Top of
the combat round at this moment Beau youre up first
 Hearing this noise you are on the wall at
this point keeping an eye You guys would probably
be at angles here if you maintained patrol and
tried to case both sides
 You saw them move casually past one window
and then move quicker past the other
 Youre over here on the wall
 You guys have been on the wall this whole
time so youre right over here Essentially about
that high
 Okay go ahead and make a dexterity check
 Where directly do you want to aim it
 You go ahead and you throw it It lands
Its going to take a second for it to go off but
it definitely seems to have rolled passed and over
in the vicinity just past that corner
 That was your action and Ill say bonus
action to pull it out light it and throw
 Along the wall
 All right  Thats about as far as
you can get right there
 Ending your turn Caleb youre up
 So you can have four attacks in a single
round
 And your movement is twice as much So you
have  feet a turn
 Ill put this on Keg as a reminder So you
move in  right there
 All right that finishes your go
 All right One of them shouts We got
company over his shoulder behind
 A natural  on the dice Going to move in
here this one is going to move in as well They
are probably going to move right there Theyre
both going to make attacks on Nott
 The first one is going to be a  to hit
 You duck out of the way You see the short
sword they pull spark across the stone carving
down the side No impact The other one uses that
moment to try and swing at you Thats equally
terrible Thats far worse actually Thats a
six
 Both of them  no effect but
theyre both shouting back over their shoulders
like Intruder Company That finishes their go
Nila youre up first
us extra strength
 You move inside 
   You can get right into that doorway
right there
 Unfortunately you cannot get close enough
to hit them physically Youre too far away from
the combat
 Yes
 All right Poison Spray Yeah that one
creatures does has a ten feet range Okay It
makes a constitution saving throw That is a
failure with a natural five so roll damage on
that It is a d right Plus d Does this
damage increase as you level up
 A lot of cantrips do Yes it does so roll
d
  points of poison damage to the one on the
left there All of a sudden as Nila rounds the
corner extending your hand this sudden plume of
dark purplishblack gas emanates around their
face They begin coughing horribly as it stings
the inside of their lungs and throat That
finishes your turn That brings us to Nott
 Which one
 All right you go to that door Its
locked
 You can use your action to try and fast pick
it if you like Its up to you Because you can
do that as a rogue
 Go for it
  It holds tight
 You have currently  feet
  That puts you right there That
ends your go It is now Clays turn
 No she did not do her totem
 Youre about there
 Ending your go Keg youre up
front of Nila
  Yeah easily Whoa you dart
past Nilas standing there
 Yes she does Nilas standing there
finishes the Poison Spray suddenly theres this
blur of speed plate and hair as Keg rushes by
Nilas side actually causing the edge of her
clothing to ripple up and back down into place
Theyre both there right in your face and they
watch as you emerge They dont even have time to
process what you are Youre just a shape and
anger and theyre like Whoa What do you want
to do
battleaxe
 All right go for it First attack
 That hits roll damage
eight
 Eight points of damage  He looks
hurt like between the poison gas and that hes
hurt Hes not down yet but hes looking rough
time with the warhammer why not just for fun
That will be  plus seven I cant do math
  plus seven Yeah  that hits Roll
damage
  With that hes  What the
Second hit and he goes down like a sack of potatoes

 He is on the ground not moving His friend
just sees it goes What
smack him the friend thats still there 
  This time seeing this go down he
dodges out of the way and your weapon scrapes
across the outside of the door frame actually
cutting a bit into it You have to pull it out
Still have your bonus action if you wanted to do a
fourth attack
to try again 
  Unfortunately he just manages to duck
twice The second time actually gleans off the
shoulder but the armors too thick No impact
 What do you want to do
Im not I have a little bit more movement right
 You have ten feet of movement yes
 You can move  You cant quite get
between the two of them but you can be wedged
into the doorway If they try to move away from
you you will get an attack of opportunity if you
want to take one as a reaction
 That ends your turn Back at the top Beau
youre up
 Not quite yet because its on an initiative
of 
 Make an acrobatics check to leap off the
wall
  thats enough You get right to the
kitchen
 Youre just at the door Thats your full
movement
 Okay
 
 Okay gotcha
 You glance over just to see this quick flash
of Beau disappearing down the hallway
 Caleb youre up
 Yeah
 Roll an attack
 No Phils the one standing
  to hit Phil that hits
 One of them was human one looked to be
halfelf Phil is the halfelf You see this
younger looking guy
 Ooh
 So ten plus
 Right cantrip at thlevel it does d
 Yeah Cantrips get better
 Okay  points of damage You feel the
sudden burst of warm air up under your outfit for
a moment Nila as this fire bolt goes firing
through from between your legs and explodes into
the chest of the guard in front of you 
Backs up and the flames lick up the front of his
armor before he pats them out for a second That
finish your turn Caleb
 Finishing Calebs go
 Hes right there Knock the chair over as
you back up At this point you guys all hear
echoing off in the distance  Small
firecrackers are now exploding on the outside of
the front fortress 
 Nott as you were looking off you see a
shape run past and start heading for the door You see
 Past this way you see a figure make their
way to the door and put their back to it They
havent noticed you yet
 As they put their back to the door focusing
on where the sound of those fireworks go off
looks back through the doorway into the middle of
the mess hall hears this commotion and looks
right to you
 Does see you Because youre not trying to
hide and it is a lit interior This is Wohn This
is the female human barbarian that had rushed
Caleb before Previously had a great maul
However is instead wielding a very familiar
twohanded greatsword Wide blade with runic hilt
The weapon that Yasha had on her
 However thats her turn That brings us to
Nila Youre up
 He is not You can just barely see another
individual who appears to be joining the fray
across the way One of the slavers that is
responsible for taking your family
 Okay
 Are you going Poison Spray or you going
 Okay You step in
 Go for it Swing for the attack Actually
you could if you wanted to Ill allow you to
move in to flank with Keg Thatll give you
advantage on the attack roll
 Plus seven so that would be  So roll one
more time
 Well take the  So that hits Go ahead
and roll damage Thats a d plus four
 All right Ten points of damage You rush in
 as you clock Phil on the side of his
head it slams him against the stone wall Hes
like Ugh His eyes rolling within his skull He
looks pretty heavily beaned Still conscious but
pretty badly beat up at this point That finish
your turn
totem I want to do it as close to the trapdoor
as I can to hopefully protect as many people
inside
 You have no visual unfortunately because
this door is still closed and locked All you can
see is whats in this room this kitchen and this
chamber here You have no visual on the trapdoor
from when I
 You know where it is yes
 Okay so youre taking the totem
 feet of it
 For the next minute yes
smell bag real quick Hold on
 Your choice
 Okay Since I actually skipped over Phils
turn Phils going to out of retribution for the
attack swing towards you Nila having had no
luck against you and having not even wanting to
touch this weird dwarven blur thats just
destroyed his friend Hes going to swing
towards you with the blade Thats going to be a
 Whats your armor class
  Your shield deflects it off the side No
impact All right Phils accepting his fate
Nott youre up
 She has noticed you yes
 She used her turn to move and dash so had
no action yet But went up against the front door
hearing the sound from outside and then turned
and just focused on you
 Okay
  wisdom saving throw Thats a natural
six Falls prone
 She falls cackling to the ground 
and is rolling on the ground the blade falling
out of her grip for the moment and then she
clutches it back to her rolls with it
 Yeah
 Okay
 Thats fine 
 Yes
 Which direction Around here
  There you go
 That finishes Notts go Clay youre up
 Are you jumping off the wall or going full
square on the outer wall
 Make an acrobatics check to try and land
  Okay you fall to one knee but you get
up okay You dont take any damage
   Youre just coming up on the
outside of the kitchen The horse is just 
 That finishes Clays turn Keg youre up
 Yeah
 Go for it
  definitely hits
 Nine points of damage
 Phil is down Whack up the side of the
head Phil just crumples to the ground
up to Nott
  You have ten more feet You cant
quite get to Nott but theres a laughing
barbarian on the ground
 Up to you
 So the dwarf moves into there
then I hastily All right here we go Fuck
 Yeah its advantage on the attack
  No
 Nope The first attack you go to swing and
she rolls over from the laughter and just hit the
ground The stone cracks from the impact
 Yeah because that was your second attack
Then you have your extra attack and then you have
a bonus attack
 Thats how you have an additional attack So
you have two more attacks
  definitely hits
 Yep
 All right roll damage on that
 She makes a saving throw
 What is the DC She rolled a 
 Yeah that spell has faded
 Shes still prone and you get another
attack if you like
 You still have advantage shes still
prone
  does not hit It misses by one
 Im sorry However you are just a
frightening display in front of her
 That does hit
damage
  points of damage all right You have one
more attack from the action surge
 Roll your dice and double it
 Thats ten Ten plus your modifier
  points of damage
 You rolled a five you double that to ten
and then add the four So  damage on a single
hit With that one final burst of interior
strength and adrenaline kicks in and you slam
twice into the body of Wohn on the ground the
wind knocked out of her Her eyes go wild for a
second before focusing on you the anger and
hatred brewing in her face as her brow furrows
That I believe is all you can do on your turn
 She does get an attack of opportunity on
you swinging from the ground towards you She is
prone so she has disadvantage on the attack roll
but shes going to try Thats going to be 
 Yeah It clangs against the back of your
armor and you manage to get out of the way
 Top of the round is Beau
 Notts right there on the other side
 Oh  feet sorry
 There you go thats your  feet
 By the way in the background still

 All right youre not quite against youre
ten feet from Nott right now
 Thats your full movement You have to use a
dash action if you wanted to try and you move at
half speed carrying Nott
 What are you going to do
 You dash Thats five
  There you go So you get Nott
about there
  You manage to drag Nott to the
door
 Its locked
 Caleb
 Yes
 Ten  
 No you can go two more steps if you want
  right there
 Damn this new iPad is eating it on the
music
 I think its just slow The old one
disappeared and I have to get a new one
 I cant find the bag Its fine Dont worry
about it
 If you wanted to go there as opposed to
there Ill let you stand there You can just
barely see somebody on the ground
 No longer laughing
 Go for it roll for the attack with
disadvantage
 Unfortunately strikes the stone ground and
bursts into fire No effect
 Ending Calebs turn  Runs
up charging angrily is going to reckless attack
Is going to attack twice with her greataxe against
you with reckless so its with advantage on both
attacks The first attack is a natural  All
right so thats a natural  on the first one
Second attack is a natural  plus seven So yeah
she hits you with both First ones a crit
 Thats cocked That is going to be  points
of slashing damage for the first hit The
greatsword ends up striking across your chest the
impact sending you back and Haste disappears
 She has Yashas sword and dispelled it
 Then swings back with a second strike
towards you and impacts
 Thats going to be  points of slashing
damage The second strike against you with the
greatsword the flash of white energy you see the
runes on the hilt suddenly spark and that
adrenaline in your body suddenly fades and your
body becomes super lethargic and you are stunned
for your next turn
 The Haste has faded and your body is
drained
 As soon as Haste ends your body
 Thats how it works thats the downside of
the spell man
 Next turn you cant do anything
 Nila youre up
 Currently you walk up and try the door
Its locked
 Make a strength check Roll a d and roll
your strength modifier
 Plus
 Plus two  You force your shoulder
against it and it doesnt give The feeling and
the sensation of knowing your family is nearby
surges in your body and you pull back a few more
steps and then charge in With one aggressive
 the door flips open The actual handle
itself breaking and snapping on the wood
 Essentially With a  thats exactly what
it is That door is now open and you step through
and join the rest of them
 You can do a bonus action thing yes but
your action has been used to break through the door
of us at least the three of us for now Unless I
get Caleb too with the bear spirit totem
 You could drop it there As a matter of
fact everybody except for Keg and Clay
strength checks
 Ten temporary hit points
strength and saving throws
 When the spirit appears so you guys do not
get it unfortunately
 So ten temporary hit points to Caleb Nila
Nott and Beau for the next minute
 That ends Nilas turn Nott youre up
 The door is locked yes
 Okay
 The Mage Hand doesnt have the delicate
touch
 I kind of have too
 So thats your action and your bonus action
 Yeah you can move if you wish to
 Okay Clay its you and the horses What
are you doing
  
  Youre so big this was not designed for
his firbolg form
 Thats your movement
  You walk into this chamber and
you see everybody else You also see this weird
spectral bear spirit that seems to have apparated
in the center of this hallway that looks at you
and goes 
 You can You glance over and take in the
scene Thats your movement and your action
 Correct
 You can yeah
 A d plus your wisdom modifier
 Thats your turn
 Keg youre up
 You cant do anything because youre
stunned
 Thats the end of your turn Top of the
round Beau
 Youre still  feet from Wohn
 If you want to be on there instead yeah
 Okay youre going to attempt to ricochet
off of her armor Go for it
 Go for it
 Im just embellishing for fun Why not
 Well see if it works
  hits Actually you have an advantage
technically because she was doing reckless
attacks last turn
 That hits First one hits
 These are the
 These are still darts theyre modified
darts You would need to get daggers or things
that are considered monk weapons to do additional
damage
 Five damage Second one with advantage
still
  hits Roll damage
 Five and eight As youre there getting
your brain back in the space and the strength
returns to you You look up at the time the
barbarian is pulling back for another round of
blows the giant blade still crimson with your own
blood These two serrated bladelike discs into
her chest from over your shoulders You glance
over quickly and see Beau waving to you through
the doorway
aroused
 All righty that finishes Beaus turn
Caleb youre up
 Well technically you dont have advantage
Its advantage on melee attacks not ranged
attacks but its fine
  hits
 So two hits
 Nice Oof Thatll be enough How do you
want to do this Caleb
 She screams out in pain the flesh itself
burning black instantly and cracking as she falls
to the ground screaming The voice slowly thins
out into a faint  before expiring
Need you to make a wisdom saving throw Caleb
  You take a moment and push through and
keep your wits about you
 The firecrackers have ended Silence comes
over the fortress
 None that you see or hear
 Go for it
 DC is getting higher with each
 Total of 
 Its not going through This is a very
intricate lock Its obviously protecting a lot
 Make a strength check if you want to You
still have advantage on the strength checks
because youre a bear for the time being
 Roll it one more time
 The door is too strong This one is actually
reinforced and seems to knowing what its
hiding designed to be the strongest door on this
floor
 Over here
 Grab the sword You pull the sheath off her
back and slip it in the haversack
 If youd like to It takes a moment for you
to rifle through her stuff
 Investigation
  Okay You manage to find about  gold
pieces in the pouch that she keeps on her side
You find another pouch that is a bunch of dried
meats that have been salted and smoked like a
jerky You also find another pack that has teeth
in it Just a collection of teeth Different
sizes different ages
 No keys
 Theyve bled out
 Not on the trapdoor the door that leads
into it
 The door is locked yeah
  The door opens
 All right You go to the trapdoor
  It is trapped
 From the underside of it
 Roll for reach around

 This is still another thieves tools check
so still plus seven
  Thatll do it
 You manage to just lift the trapdoor enough
to slide your hand underneath There is a trigger
cable underneath that has been set into a hook
Right before it pulls taut enough for it to snap
you grab it lift it up put it onto a shoulder
Using the cable you pull it back until you find a
piece of rock off to the side and hook it to it to
where it maintains the tautness You find another
metal ring that is designed specifically to hold
the trap when its not set It does not go off
The trapdoor opens and there is a staircase that
descends to a lower floor
 Okay Make a perception check for Frumpkin
  Okay Frumpkin descends slowly down the
stairs Theres a faint bit of torchlight in
there You hear whimpering A few voices faintly
whimpering Inside the chamber I can show you actually
 Ill be right back

 So hi guys Frumpkin slowly descends the
staircase and you can see a rack that is bolted
into the wall that has chains hanging from it a
few other sets of manacles a few torture
the end brands There are a few spaces that are
currently empty where tools probably would
normally hang and there is another door that
leads to a chamber beyond and thats where you
hear the whimpering coming from
 As Frumpkin looks within you can see
another chamber You can see another hired figure
at least the same cloaked individuals you had
encountered before same attire who is currently
sitting at the back up against the wall and is
looking in the direction of the door expectantly
 Make a stealth check for Frumpkin Frumpkin
also noticed there is a cage in the corner that
contains two figures in there Looks to be two
humanoid figures
 With that perception roll and the low light
its hard to tell One appears to be larger one
appears to be smaller
 Make a stealth check
 Okay Unnoticing he sits there waiting arm
against the wall Frumpkin slowly makes his way
through this hallway It bends off on a corner
around the side Frumpkin continues beyond and it
curves around another corner here There is an
archway that leads into another room that has two
more cages that contain each cage contains
another figure The figures in there appear to be
slumped down and either unconscious or sleeping
 Here
 You see Ruzza and Protto two more members
of The Iron Shepherds that are currently waiting
there with their eyes towards the entryway
expectantly It seems that they have been notified
of your presence
 I dont know maybe the loud firecrackers
going off right above
 Frumpkin would be here
 As theyre both standing there waiting
Protto the little halfling sharpshooter creep
glances up and goes takes his shortbow and
 Pulls it off his shoulder Mmhmm
 Yeah thats the last you see
 One in that chamber and then two in there
 In that last room it was two
 All right So are you sending Frumpkin
upstairs
 So you go ahead and descend the stairs into
this chamber
 Okay
 Okay So you stay at the stairs there
Beau
 All right As you glance through Clay you
can see the faint light in here you can see the
figures walking up to the cage eyes still
trained on the door
 Make a deception check
 No Its allowing him to do one
 I saw it
 
 All right Ill get back to work
 Im going to finish up As you turn around
and begin to ascend the stairs you begin to hear
what sounds like a child beginning to scream

 Make a deception check
 He pulls back You can see theres a heated
spike thats orange at the tip that he pulls out
of the cage He goes 
 He steps back towards the table at the back
and sets it down there where you can see there are
other implements laid out He comes back to the
cage and goes Ill be back later and comes to
the door where you are
 Opens the door
 Steps up the stairs makes it up through the
hatch
 Everybody make an ambush round He was not
expecting that
 Oh shit Is this on your Shillelagh What
are you doing with this
 Okay
 Yeah you all hit What are you doing
 Nah
 All right roll your d
 Eightsided
 Thats  plus four  points of damage
Whack Upside the head as he dizzies off from that
point immediately going into Keg Roll damage on
that one
 Six damage and carved from the battle axe
 What are you using
 Its a d
 Yeah because its a quarterstaff
 Plus your strength modifier
 Crack And then
 Its a sneak attack yeah

 Yeah thatll do it He comes up and
immediately and falls to the ground barely
conscious looking up his face bloodied and the
crossbow bolt jammed into his shoulder and past
the rib and hes having a hard time breathing
 You watch as Clay hushing as he just slowly
pushes his face in with his fist repeatedly
 Caleb what are you doing
 So you coast around here
 Make your way through down this hall to
the bedroom where you had seen was Lorenzos room
not present Crawls over to the next bedroom two
beds Not present
 Toward the stairs where Frumpkin was
 Okay
 All right Youre at the base essentially
or near the staircase that leads up and out to
this space there
 All right Whats everybody else doing
 Okay so Keg is staying up with Caleb
 Nila you head down
case
 Okay so you have one minute before that
spell goes away
 Okay As you enter this lower chamber you
come in with a fair light You look over on the
table and there are the implements there You step
out and there is a moment where you touch your
foot to the ground and something gives way You
see a cable that was run through the ground
quickly whip up the air and you glance up to see
heavy netting that contains a bunch of broken
brick and stone that falls down from the center of
the chamber I need both Nott and Nila to make
dexterity saving throws please
 It only lasts a nice
  Thats a failure on your point That is
eight points of bludgeoning damage to you four
points to you as this pile of stone fills the
corner You guys manage to step off to the side
and pull yourself out of the rubble but you get
the sense now that this room is definitely trapped
and there is definitely an awareness within and
deeper of your presence Nila as you recover from
this you glance up and see the cage in the corner
that you had passed when you first entered and you
see a hand hanging off one of the metal bars a
and vanishing into the faint grayishblue tint of
what is Asars hand
want to make sure that theres nothing that is
going to trigger something else
 Make an investigation check
 Plus
 Investigation
Should I use my luck point now
 No she didnt use it last time she saved
it
 All right go for it

 Well you still pick the one you want to so
you go with the previous one You dont have to pick
the one Pretty sure thats how the luck feat
works right
 From best you can tell there is nothing no
contraption adhered to the cage Its just a cage
You come up close and look inside You can see
Kitor your partner is slumped in the back of the
cage unconscious With what little bit of light is
in here as you focus you have darkvision so you
can see in his unconscious face he is still
breathing but there are wounds and scrapes You
look and see Asar who is awake who is currently
holding a burn puncture right in his abdomen He
looks up to you the sweat dripping down his face
and goes Mama Mama and leans up to the cage
and puts his hand over the outside of the bar and
reaches out for you with the other hand and
entwines his fingers Mama you came
them Can I heal them
 If you have a heal spell yeah
 Yeah
 Whats your healing word to your son
 Whats the word you say that heals him
 What phrase Its up to you
 Roll a d
 Sure Ill let it Its all right
 I think its a plus four Yeah okay
Looking really hurt from whatever injuries hes
sustained you watch as the injuries slowly close
up and he breathes a little heartier again and
looks at you with a renewed smile his hand still
entwining your fingers and says Mama I want to
go home
you out of here I grab that cage and try to pull
it apart as much as I can
 Well make a strength check just for the
hell of it Because life gets weird
 Okay you move into the corridor
 Like this
 You begin to  and you watch as
Nilas arms pop with the muscles filling with
adrenaline and emotion as the metal bars bend ever
so slightly Just enough to maybe fit Asar
through not your mate You pull them just enough
and you reach through and he pulls his way and
you help him grab his shoulder and slowly you
pull your son free from the cage and into your arms
want to run I dont know what to do I look
inside and see if theres any way that I can pull
further to get Kitor out too
 The bars have gone as far as they can go
and you continue to pull the emotion in there
Your strength is waning from the physical exertion
of getting even that bit of the metal open
help himself out of here if I heal him
 You can try yeah
 Go for it
 Sam
 Buddy
 Roll for Healing Word
 Okay
 Im going to need a new iPad This thing is
crashing and falling apart the whole night Great job
 All right Make an investigation check
 Sam were not making money for charity You
can slow your roll here buddy
 Yeah to heal
 In the immediate chamber
 Focusing on this you dont sense any
immediate magical auras within the chamber
 Nothing that you can see in the immediate
area no
 You watch as Kitor  One eye is
swollen shut the other opens a bit and you watch
as the swelling slowly goes away from that eye
Its still purple from the outside but the
swelling has diminished from the healing effect of
your spell and he looks up My mate He looks
down at his hands and looks out and sees that
Asars been freed and he looks out at the strange
crew looks towards both of you and 
help Can you get out
 Help me
 He stands up in the cage his hunched form
is crammed in by this cage that was not designed
for his firbolg body Nevertheless he reaches out
and grabs the bars where you had started On
go ahead and make a strength check with advantage
Thats a natural  and a natural  I love it
when it works for the narrative

 That puts it over  Both of you together
 and one of the bars comes off on one
side He gets in quickly and puts his shoulder in
and pushes against the other and that bends off
to the side leaving just enough room for him to
push through It takes a minute and youre helping
him and grabbing his elbow and the two of your
together You feel something pop in his shoulder
but its just enough to get his body to wedge out
of the space and he comes back out of it and
embraces you the other arm limply hanging at one
side but he takes you in his hand He looks down
at his son and looks over at the rest of you
tired Still amongst the trauma he has suffered
there is a pride and a silent strength to him
very much similar to that youve seen in Nila I
do not know by what grace youve come to us but
thank you
 That she is and pets the back of your
head
 Kitor picks up Asar and throws him over his
shoulder now standing in his full form just
below the ceiling of this chamber taller even
than Clay Thank you Lets go home
 Good luck
 You watch as the three of them given a
second chance at life and freedom step through
the door where you entered and vanish up the
stairs the heavy footfalls dissipating as they
grow further and further from you The two of you
who have been focusing that point the Haste
spell having coursed into your body glance
behind and see as the family steps through the
kitchen door and exits Theres only one path left
to find the others that were taken And thats
where well leave tonights game

 Welcome back Last we had left off lets
see if I can get some music here situated
Perfect The Mighty Nein an intrepid band of
adventurers here in the continent of Wildemount
had found three of their members taken in the
middle of the night by a band of kidnappers and
slavers they found to be called The Iron
Shepherds In trying to hunt down and find where
their allies were taken they ran into a previous
member of this team known as Keg a dwarven
warrior who herself was on a path to vengeance
against these people she previously worked with
Aligning forces they made their way northward
towards the city of Shadycreek Run which exists
outside of the laws and boundaries of the
Dwendalian Empire Along the way they ambushed
The Iron Shepherds and in doing so lost one of
their allies With Mollymauk fallen on the
battlefield and the rest left to simmer over the
decisions they made they continued northward
where they encountered a new friend north of the
city of Shadycreek Run Caduceus Clay was pulled
from his hermit lifestyle north of the city within
the confines of the Savalierwood to join them in
assaulting The Sour Nest the keep where the Iron
Shepherds call home They staked out the outskirts
of this location managed to slay some of the
guardians who were keeping watch along the outer
perimeter wall not necessarily very stealthily
made their way into the entryway but managed to
take out a number of members of the Iron
Shepherds some of their paid compatriots as well
as some of their more elite at least one of their
more elite fighters Along with them they had met
Nila who is a firbolg who was searching for her also
kidnapped partner and son Using her druidic
powers aided them in this assault and in doing
so found and helped her family escape As she
absconded from the location with her family to
keep them safe the rest of you remained behind
trying to find out where the remainder of The Iron
Shepherds reside within The Sour Nest and how best
to deal with their presence Last we left off
Caleb you had sent Frumpkin your familiar in
the form of a spider to inspect the upper floor
of the chamber and upon feeling a squeeze from
Keg had just instilled her with the speed and
alacrity of a Haste spell And thats where were
going to pick up In this moment Keg as you go
to notify Caleb of what has transpired below he
reaches out and instills you with that familiar
surge of adrenaline Time seems to slow your
muscles tense and flex What do you do
 Hes a slow spider
 Yeah
shouldnt just barrel ahead
 Frumpkin has curled his way to the top floor
and you can see there are the two open hallways
here from left to right Frumpkin would be I got
two mics to make this work Frumpkin appears on
the secondary floor looking down both hallways in
which there appear to be no signs of anyone at the
moment
 Your Haste is running out
downstairs I just got to waste the Haste
 Caleb begins to slowly climb up the stairs
feeling out along these spirals as it carries from
the bottom floor to the upper tier of The Sour
Nest fortress
 You would if you want to stay quiet yes
With disadvantage
to go ahead and yeah its four A nine
 As Caleb begins to fumble his way up the
stairs Keg coasts up past him double Haste speed
clanging all the way Frumpkin can hear this from
the top floor You hear this heavy sound of like
two giant bags of pots and pans  You
make your way to the top
 Keg you have about two more rounds before
your Haste runs out You now see both sides of
this hallway are open and empty They both curl
around the corner to show the perimeter and there
are rooms in the interior You see one doorway
right across from where you entered
 Calebs about  feet below
 In waiting for Caleb to ascend the stairs
the Haste spell comes to a complete cycle Your
body is filled with lethargic energy drain and
you find yourself stunned there for a moment at
the top of the stairs as the spell fades But
Caleb has joined you
 This path here
 The two of you begin to move slowly in this
direction as Frumpkin slowly curls in spider
speed further down this edge There is a closed
doorway here and it curves around this side Do
you continue Theres a door right there
 Okay Frumpkin continues down eventually
revealing the back hallway to be also empty
Theres nobody inside that hall at the moment but
you see a second doorway right at the back there
It seems there is either a linked chamber or two
different rooms that have entryways right there
 Frumpkin peeks under the door and unveils
some sort of a rest chamber for a number of
hirelings You do see inside currently two
sleeping hired members who have begun waking up
from the recent sounds to go through their stuff
 Its what they could find on Amazon So yes
they do They both seemingly alarmed by the
recent sounds of both the fireworks outside and
the commotion downstairs
me Okay great
 Theyre going into these chests and pulling
out their armor and theyre in the process of
putting on the leather armor Theyre getting
ready to scramble downward
 At the moment yes
 All right Frumpkin continues down this
hall
 You guys reach the corner as well and as you
spin around the edge you can see there are two
doors that lead to two other chambers that are
separated on the opposite end
 As you go near the first door Frumpkin
enters this chamber which reveals another shared
bedchamber Maybe more elite members of the Iron
Shepherds call a room to bed for the evening As
Frumpkin enters this space you hear the far door
open up on that side Footsteps as the now donned
armor and armed hirees of the Iron Shepherds begin to
make their way down the stairs below
 You guys are down in the basement still
after you sent Nila up with her family to exit
 Up near the hatch on the upper stairs
 You didnt put it anywhere else so yeah
just sitting up against a wall
 It is a little bit It takes a while for the
decomposition to take effect
 The stairs to go down are right there
Thats the one exit you have
 As Frumpkin enters the final room it
reveals a large bedchamber adorned with more
intricate silks and accoutrement to design a
garish but somewhat ghastly bedroom in dark reds
and purples You can see on the side of the bed
a plate that still contains mostly eaten remains
of some sort of creature The room smells of a
musty smoke and some thick animalistic musk Its
hard to pinpoint but its a putrid stench
immediately once it hits Frumpkins nose But the
room is empty
 Make a perception check
 As this is transpiring what did you roll
for a perception check
 There doesnt look to be anything about the
stonework or beneath the bed at Frumpkins level
that looks out of the ordinary Frumpkin briefly
leaps up onto the edge of the bed and you can see
the bed while it was once well made seems to
have been worn the actual cushion is sagged
pretty heavy in the center it looks like its
been slept in for quite some time
 For stealth Yeah Still with disadvantage

 Better than last time By one
 Its a scale in the right direction So Keg
as you hold up your plates a bit like youre
trying to cross a puddle youre trying to tiptoe
down the stone hallway towards the staircase The
rest of you begin to hear what sounds like the
arrival of footsteps rushing along the stone on
the outside of the small hallway that leads to the
trapdoor into the basement What do you do
 Yeah its maybe a foot wide hallway
 Yeah you can do that Make a stealth check
please
 As Nott darts around the corner you
suddenly hit what feels like a wall at first But
its softer and covered in material You look up
to see one of the hooded lackeys of the Iron
Shepherds who had just come around the other side
Goes What the fuck and pulls out his short sword
 Her you mean
 All right Ill say make a deception check
Caduceus with advantage because youve been given
help from your friends
 They both stop and glance and look at this
and the one that Nott had bumped into leans
forward you can see his squared scarred chin
where none of his facial hair grows from some sort
of deep wound he had received at a younger age
You see his eyes these deep sunken brown irises
staring back as he goes I dont think Ive ever
seen you around here before
 I understand that but not every
transformation is impervious to scrutiny Wait
shit weve been infiltrated He pulls his other
blade out the guy behind him goes ahead and pulls
out his blade as well Roll initiative

 This is small enough where we can theater of
mind this
 Okay
 You will be in just a moment Youre
catching up to it Youre coming around the
corner They were a bit quicker than you and you
were trying to be stealthy
 No worries all right Beau youre up
first they rolled really bad initiative
 Not as bad as these guys but
 Go for it roll for attack

 Hits Roll damage
 You can Saving throw on that is a six
 The one who just drew the blade as you
crack him upside the head he stumbles a couple of
feet into the wall As he backs up you can see
his eyes rolling around in the sockets and hes
trying the grab the edge of the stonework to get
his bearings He has no idea where he is for the moment
 Go for it Attack rolls have have advantage
now because he is stunned
 That hits
 Hes still standing but hes looking pretty
beat up and hes just making vowel sounds now
Speech isnt capable given the series of events
that have transpired
 Also with advantage
 That hits roll damage
 As youre like Shh 
 Just repeatedly slamming his head into the
stone until his arms go limp You slide his face
across the stone as he collapses to the ground

 As youre doing that the guy behind him
who was his backup sees this happen because his
initiatives next in the order and he turns and
runs

 He goes at a full run and then a dash so
hes about  feet away from you down the hallway
getting near the front doors of the fortress
 At this point Keg youve just come down
the stairs Roll initiative for me
 Thatll put you next at the top of the
order You see this guy cross around the corner as
you step to the bottom of the steps theres a
moment of pause where you both make eye contact
Oh this is awkward Were going to finish up
with Nott and Caduceus and then well come back to
you Nott what are you doing
 Yeah you have enough movement to get around
and you can still see him as hes turning around the side
 Yeah thatll hit
 Its not sneak attack no
 That hits roll damage again
 As both crossbow bolts  in his
back he reaches back and you can see the muscles
in his shoulders pull back from the pain and he
looks back in your direction then glances back at
Keg Hes not sure which threat is more nominal at
the moment Caduceus your turn
 Thats a natural five on his wisdom saving
throw Dexterity or wisdom I dont remember but
it doesnt matter
 Yeah thats not happening
 Go ahead and roll your damage on that
 Keg you watch the person run around the
corner and look at you and go Uh pained
grunting get shot with two bolts from behind
tense up and then burst into radiant flame and
then collapse to the ground slow smoldering on
the stone

 He will be in a moment
 It looks like hes not putting up much of a
fight at the moment
is he from me
 Roll an attack with advantage because hes
Sure go for it
 You dont even have to roll damage You walk
up and you see him on the ground going pained
yelling and rolling and you shake your head
 Like a watermelon at a Gallagher performance
you bring your war hammer down on top of his skull
and paint a new carpet for the front entryway of
The Sour Nest At that moment it doesnt appear
like theres any immediate danger or movement You
all take a moment to look about and theres no
sign of anybody else coming at the moment
 A strange blur streaks by Caduceus you see
it from the upstairs It looks like a blur of
black No larger than that big It scoots past and
curves around the corner back in the direction of
the basement
 You guys see this and begin to follow past
Beauregard youre still standing back by the
hatch and something stops in front Make a
perception check
 Ten It wizzes right past you and you dont
even have a moment to make out any details of what it is
 It immediately heads down the stairway
towards where you found Nilas family into the basement
 You guys have returned to the entry where
you had met Nilas family and sent her off to
protect them You now head down the hallway that
curves to the right You had made some intel when
you had sent Frumpkin earlier to see You saw in
the next chamber two members Ruzza and Protto of
The Iron Shepards waiting on the opposite end
weapons ready knowing youre coming There appear
to be two cages with people inside but you
couldnt make out any details
 Caleb as you continue down the hall
unveiling it to the right it still appears to be
open without issue You peek further down The
rest of you follow suit or do you stay in the back chamber
stealthwise
 Make a stealth check please A stealth
check for you too Caleb but you have advantage
 Stealth checks for all those that are going
to follow
 Nice
check
 I dont know Do you want to be stealthy or
not
 Okay Kegs going to make to the edge of the
hall and just wait
 As you guys all make your way quietly around
the side Caduceuss armor catches the edge of the
stonework and gives this faint grinding sound But
you work forward Looking inside you can see
these two archways in this chamber you had
previously seen There on the other side you can
see Ruzza and Protto weapons ready whispering to
each other As youre standing there Caleb that
familiar sound that buzzing small dark shape
appears and stops for a second there in space You
can see a small bird

 A jet black hummingbird hovering there

 With something long and metallic in its
beak It darts up into the shadow and is gone


 You hear as Ruzza looks over to Protto and
goes Are they coming or not Im getting
impatient Protto goes Yeah maybe we should
poke one of them He pulls out a blade and jams
it into the cage to the left You hear a voice
against the gag A muffled yell
 Right here
 Make a perception check
 You move up against the side What faint
bit of light is coming from the almost entirely
extinguished torch on the wall You see a bit of
shifting movement and you hear the movement of
chains inside the cage where the blade had just
been stabbed inside You see a large shifting
graywhite shape in the shadow You hear a muffled
voice cursing against the constraints of the
binding Out of the corner of your eye a hand
slips out of a chain carrying the same metal
object that the small bird was carrying in its
beak

 The hand slowly pulls the gag away from the
mouth Khary if youd like to join us at the table

Im tired of this stabbing feeling
 The rest of you what are you doing
 As the three of your heads poke around the
corner all three of you shift as Keg slams into
from behind Both of their heads who were
currently bickering of Protto and Ruzza look back
towards the front Shit theyre here Back up
They both begin to retract and back up into the
chamber behind them
 If youd like to
 All right
 Well now that were entering combat and
everybodys there its time to roll initiative
Everyone roll initiative
 All righty do we have   to 
 Whats your dexterity bonus
 All right  You are tied with Ruzza
 With The Duchess now perched upon the wall
you can see creeping around the side the tiny
goblin face of Nott and Beauregard hood up around
the edge For the first time in a day or two you
sense the tide turning in your favor All right
 to  anybody
  to ten
 Oh Caleb all righty  to ten
 All righty ten to five
 What did you get
 You guys are going to go at the same time
because you have the same dexterity You and Ruzza
are going to go at the same time what are you
going to do
do is be the eyes of these people since Im still
working on getting out of my predicament Lets
say we move The Grand Duchess to a safe but at
least well lit place to see the action
 The Duchess darts across the chamber across
from where the torch is and perches upon a piece
of the protruding stonework where she has a good
view of the hallway where theyre currently
receding and the chamber youre in
these two gentlemen who have been keeping me company
 The gentleman and the lady you see them
both pretty well She at the same turn is
running down the hallway So what are you doing
lock Is there anything I can do to knock it open
at this point I still only have one hand free
right
 Youve managed to get both of your hands
free and slowly dropped the manacles and the gag
Youve been working on this for a while Youre
still in the cage
early in the
nothing like a spiritual weapon to tear into a

 All right and what form is your spiritual
weapon

 All right With your view you could drop it
directly in front of Protto or behind Protto to
still try and get the strike Would you want it in
the front or the back
how many pins I can knock over Im just asking
 At this distance you could get one Youd
be able to next round try again but you could
get the one
 Well say it bowls by and slams right there
towards Protto Make a spell attack roll for me
please So d add your spell attack modifier
 Yeah
  unfortunately does not hit Prottos a
nimble fellow As Nefertitis mystical bust slams
towards him he dodges out of the way and goes
Ugh and begins darting back towards there That
was your bonus action You still have your action
to either cast a cantrip or do anything else with
your action like pick the lock or anything else
you want to try and do
little bit to see if we can get out of here
 Go for it Go ahead and roll a d add your
dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier
Thats three plus three So plus six to whatever
you roll
  total  is what you needed It was a DC
 save

 Taking the small pieces of metal and wire
that The Duchess has been slowly stealing from
throughout The Sour Nest and bringing back to your
cage you manage to get the lock to fall open
With that the cage opens and you can step out
taking your first breath of free air in a couple of days
be out with all of you beautiful people
 All right does that finish your turn
 Finishing Shakstes run Ruzza has darted
to the back there Lets see that brings us
Ruzzas going to hold her action Nott youre up
next
 Protto is out of the room but Protto is
moving through the hall further down that way
 Yeah
 You run to within  feet
 There you go Thats about   feet right
there
 No
  does not hit Protto ducks out of the way
as it hits some of the stone wall sparking before
it lands harmlessly on the wall to the back
  does hit roll damage
 Not bad As he dodges the first one the
other one He tries to duck out of the way and
instead you see it vanish into the cloak At
first you thought it just passed through
harmlessly but you hear an Ugh and he falls
and limps against the wall for a second before
looking up in your direction with a snarl
 All right That finish your turn
 No Technically you still have about 
feet
 You go to duck over towards Shakste and
your face hits something thats not there Its
like some sort of invisible force
 You immediately recognize the familiar scent
of Calebs coat right in front of you
 Caleb its your turn
 Into the cage across
 Make a perception check
 Okay Inside you see two people You see a
small child and a dwarf male older Both are
looking scared the child especially but the
dwarf has his arms around the child protectively
Though it is a human child it looks like theyve
both been in captivity for a bit and at least hes
feeling protective of the child Theyre both
stripped of any necessary implements aside from
just their clothing and they look scared but not
too worse for wear
 That brings us to Protto Hes going to Is
this working
 There we go Prottos going to dart over to
join Ruzza at the back and says Quick send it
down Ruzza whos been holding her action
reaches back and grabs some sort of a lever At
which point both of the archways to the front
and the back of the chamber that youre in you
hear this grinding of chains
 Sealing the three of you in the chamber
Beauregard Keg Caduceus in the hallway behind
as you spin around the corner this portcullis
suddenly slams down separating you from the other
half of your party
 Protto who has kept you at bay and can see
the space between the bars takes out his
crossbow The one that he can see best at this
moment is Nott Hes going to take a shot at Nott
Thats going to be a  plus four
 Plus six to hit That hits This is a
longbow not a crossbow My apologies Thats two
plus four You take six points of piercing
damage
 Then hes going to dart around the corner
 Yes you can
 There you go so three damage to you Thats
going to end Prottos go as he darts around the
corner Beau youre up
 You hold your action to try to wedge it
look back for his help and you see him turn the
other direction and start walking away Are you
going to continue with your action or still hold it
 Keg comes through that You have advantage
on this because Beauregard is helping you because
shes holding her action to help with that
Fuck So thats a 
 The bars begin to pull open ever so
slightly but not enough You do feel however
that whatever weight is carrying it down its
heavy but with two people you might have a chance
of lifting it But it looks like the bars are too
thick to try and pull apart
better
 That ends Kegs turn Caduceus
 Make an investigation check
 Whatd you get
 You start to just trace the stonework with
your fingers and then find this really fascinating
bit of moss Soft green its been growing in the
crevice You havent seen this type of moss before
 You forget for the moment what youre
doing
 Top of the turn that brings us to Shakste
and Ruzza Now shes going first because shes a
little quicker than you on this one Ruzzas going
to Lets see here Yeah shes going to
Vicious Mockery Thats a fun one Looking through
at Shakste since youre the one who stepped out
of the cage and they had seen you there for a
bit looks over to you and goes Oh Im sorry
Were our bedding arrangements not good enough for
you Oh we can arrange for a much better place to
sleep about six feet beneath this Make a wisdom
saving throw please
 Oh yeah
 Like water off a ducks back
 doesnt bother
you
just put one obstacle between us You know Im
just going to knock that one down too
 All righty What are you going to do for
your turn
within that gate is the beautiful Queen Nefertiti
I think she should just go slamming her ass all up
and down that hallway
 Go ahead and roll another attack d big
one
that end up doing
 Thats your spell attack modifier Should be
a plus seven I think
 Yeah once again Nefertiti goes grinding
through the hallway slamming near Ruzza Ruzza
quickly ducks out of the way and dodges over to
where Protto is hiding
her work for her I guess Why dont I point my
middle finger down through those slats in the gate
and send some Sacred Flame
 Yeah thatll work Thats a wisdom saving
throw I believe Or Sacred Flame is dexterity I
think it is Either way lets see what she rolls
Thats a  plus
 Taliesin is it wisdom or dexterity for
Sacred Flame
 Dex So thats a  Thats a success As
the middle finger sticks through she ducks out of
the way Shes a wily one that Ruzza and she
keeps dodging and weaving dancing around your assault
 Finishing up Shakstes turn that brings us
to Nott Whatre you doing
 Youre on deck Caleb
 You dont see Protto but you see Ruzza
 Go for it
 Oh thatll hit
 Six points of damage to Ruzza
 I mean you can certainly try
  hits Roll damage again
 Firing between these bars of the portcullis
you fire both bolts Both of them sink into the
armor and probably pierce and intrude too into
the torso of Ruzza As she falls back against the
wall Ah you son of a bitch 
 Right up next to you you bump into an
invisible Caleb again
 Caleb its your turn
 Just for the hell of it make an athletics
check for me
 All right You manage to make it most of the
way over but its a relatively heavy table for your
size and diminutive form
 You can probably get it there by the end of
next round but youre in process
 Finishing Calebs go it is now Prottos
turn Protto is going to go ahead and dart back
around the corner ducks beneath Nefertiti and
then is going to take two shots at Beauregard but
because it is between two portcullises he has
disadvantage on the strikes There is only one he
can currently see down this long hallway So the
first shot is a natural  but disadvantage That
is a nine plus six That is a  to hit Whats
your armor class
 Second shot is  to hit
 So the second longbow shot releases towards
you for eight points of piercing damage
 The first one goes wide and hits the wall
beyond the boundaries of the portcullis The
second one you see coming towards you and you just
catch it
 Probably yeah
 You go to throw it and it hits the bar
immediately upon releasing and shoots off at the
side It skids to a stop at the foot of Shakste
as he looks down at it confused
 Beau That was the end of Prottos turn
Protto is going to move back behind the corner
Now its your turn
 Holding that Keg its your go With
advantage
 Beau as you squat down to get your hands in
the position to grab it youre like All right
time to go As you go to reach for it its
already lifted up
 You see Keg there just holding it up both
arms overhead
 With that Caleb scoots the table back into
space to keep it held somewhat aloft
 That would be an additional action but you
can move through the space if you would like
 Unfortunately you had to ready your action
on your turn so you dont have any movement
 That puts you right up next to Shakste
Shakste of all the friends that you recognize
coming into this event you watch as this
shorthaired burly gritty stubblechinned
female dwarf in full jagged looking halfplate
warhammer the other a battleaxe The edge of a
mostly burned cigarette dangling at the edge of
the lip After holding this thing up and stepping
through dropping it behind her
cetera Whats your name

 Question mark
Lets do this
 Caduceus its your turn
 You watch the naturally twisted and gnarled
wooden staff that Caduceus carries which
previously had a dozen of small knot holes in it
suddenly begin to exude dozens and dozens and
dozens of small beetles that begin to swarm out of
the staff and curling onto the ground You can place it
 Its  feet you cant quite get it to
them
 Youre right next to him This swarm of
beetles is right beneath the floating bust of Nefertiti
 It wont be able to attack this turn
unfortunately
 Right but how close can you summon it
 Right so it appears  feet
 Right but its not quite close enough to
bite Its about ten feet away
 The rest of your movement puts you right
there
 As a bonus action
 That finishes your turn At the top of the
round as youre all gearing this bassy resonant
voice fills the chamber youre in Mm
 Its rare that the meat carries itself
right to your table You dont see anything
around you Thats all it says
 At the top of the round Ruzza seeing that
the scenario is turning and this trap scenario
isnt going in their favor darts away
 Darts further down that hall Shakste
 Not that you can see There is still that
portcullis blocking your path
move a little further through the slats into that
corner perch up there and see if she can see
down the hallway a little bit
 The Duchess manages to find her way over to
the far corner of that hall perches up to give
you a view and you can see as Ruzza is making her
way down the edge and around the corner vanishing
into this next chamber Oh god Im knocking
things over It happens Im sorry Its fine
Theyll be okay in the end There we go Ending
your view there what are you going to do
 You can spend the rest of your turn
investigating the room for something like that if
youd like
 Roll an investigation check
 You dont see anything in the chamber The
only thing that you did notice was the switch at
the end of the hallway that Ruzza had originally
put down to send the portcullises falling
 You saw them drop the portcullises yeah
 No its a small lever that goes downward
and causes them to be released to slam down
 For a tiny bird yeah
 You have an action if you wanted to try
something else
do to shake this thing free
 Have Nefertiti roll an attack against the
wall
 As the bust slams into the bars the metal
rings from the impact but unfortunately the mild
bulging of the metal on this side isnt enough to
cause any damage Does that finish your turn
 All right that brings it to Nott with
Caleb on deck
 As it does so you hear  and the
portcullis begins to raise up

 No Protto is ducked around the corner
 They both disappeared around the corner
from your perspective
 Well swarm of beetles yes
 Only one way to find out
 As you dart and vault over the beetles they
seem to not pay you any mind or really care of
your presence but nevertheless you dodge the
shit out of them They never had a chance
 As you turn around the corner immediately
maybe ten feet from you is Protto whos
currently pulling another arrow out of his bow and
turning around the corner glancing over Ah shit
 Your movement got you right around that
corner Thats going to be the end of it there
Caleb youre up
 Thats as far as you can get on  feet of
movement You can use your action to dash if you want
 Whats the movement of the spider again
 All right so Frumpkin moves  feet along
the ceiling on the edge making his way further
down not full enough to reveal the next chamber
but is there nevertheless
 Okay that finishes Calebs go Prottos up
Protto runs and disappears into the next chamber
You hear a door open Thats all That finishes
Beau your turn
 This is absurd
 At the moment this is more of a chase
sequence as you guys are going after them In
this order as we progress next up in the order
would be Caduceus Caduceus what are you doing
 You dont quite get that far The
invisibility lasts until the end of your next
turn The invisibility that you get
 All righty As Frumpkin creeps around the
corner the last thing that Frumpkin sees in this
area is another cage that is closed and locked
and another humanoid figure that is slumped
inside gagged and bound chains manacles behind
the back and similar to the other captives being
held There is a doorway that one of the higher
guards is closing behind him and for a brief
glimpse you see Protto and Ruzza further in the
chamber with a torch light source within the next
room before the door closes
 Are the rest of you moving in further to the
next chamber
 Make an investigation check
 As you turn around the corner you can see
the beetles swarm and Frumpkin both making their
way towards the bottom of the door as the rest of
your friends are coming along You look down and
the generally pretty roughhewn stone flooring
that most of these lower chambers entail the step
right in front of the closed door behind them
seems to have a grooved pattern in it that is
mostly filled with dust and dirt

 Go ahead and attempt to do so
 Its plus your dexterity modifier and your
proficiency modifier
 You manage to get the Mage Hand beneath and
at a quick glance you can see this is not a
mechanical contraption more than its an
enchantment on the piece of stone itself
 What you do is the Mage Hand runs itself
around the outskirts of it pulling up the dust
and dirt that has settled in to have it blend in
with the rest of the stone curling beneath and
pops it up and causes it to fold up a bit lift
out the stone tablet and drift it off to the side
and set it down The trap is still armed but that
part of the floor has now been moved out of the way
 Youre sending Frumpkin into the next
chamber
 There is a slight gap Roll a stealth check
for Frumpkin this time
 No Hes a spider
 Frumpkin curls beneath the door frame
revealing this other hired guard that was back
further in the chamber Protto and Ruzza theyve
lifted another barred trap door that guards
another set of stairs that goes deeper below into
another chamber
 Theyre stepping further down into this next
bit at which point Protto looks over his shoulder
and goes Hurry  No he gets an
attack before you can pull him back Thats a 
plus six thats a 
 That is  points of piercing damage
 A rapidfired arrow about that long Id
say against a spider would look terrible if it
wasnt a fey entity that dissipates into dust as
it blinks back into its home dimension
 How long does your beetle swarm last
 Okay It probably only has a few more maybe
ten  more seconds before it fades
 You guys couldve followed and got to the
next chamber behind them if you want
 You may
 You may
 Shes tried though
 As Nefertiti floats in behind Shakste as
youre stepping inside the spell begins to blink
out running its course
 You see now there is the unconscious
humanoid
 The unconscious humanoid figure in the cage
before you and the closed door where they all
vanished behind and you hear  Sounds
like some sort of metal object or slab has fallen
solid onto flat ground
 You checked for traps right there and there
was a trap on the floor right in front of that
doorway You disabled it moved it out of the way
and now you guys are looking at the door
 You didnt check the door you checked the
room for traps and that was the trap you saw
 The door does not appear to be trapped It
is locked however from the other side
 It is made of wood It has some metal
framing to it but its wooden primarily
 Yeah You walk up to it and there are the
two people the small child and the dwarf in the
previous chamber where you were locked and in the
chamber you just discovered there appears to be an
older gentleman in his maybe late fifties early
sixties or so Looks pretty bruised up one eye is
swollen shut the other looks pretty bloodied as
well Hes chained from behind and has the gag in
his mouth as well
that I could get the gag out of his mouth
 Yeah You go ahead and pull it free
 Who are you
of here How are the bindings on your hands
 They hurt You can see he looks weak He
probably hasnt eaten well in a number of days As
part of the process of mentally conditioning those
they capture its minimal sustenance and a lot of
mental and psychological damage as well as
physical torture to go along with it Youve seen
and endured some of it but looks like some of
these other figures have gone through more of it
 Well his hands are bound
 He looks at you with his one semigood eye
and What What are What are you Why
 Make an intimidation check
 He looks at you 
  Aah and just sadly eats the
berry
 Okay its not too bad
 Aa
 Jusca
 Im just a farmer I dont know why they
took me He pulls against the constraints from
behind Can you get me out Can you get me out
please
 All right make an attack roll
 Door yeah Make an attack roll for the
door
 Yeah no that hits Go ahead roll damage
 All right go ahead and roll dexterity
  It takes you a little bit but you do
manage to get the manacles off the back of his
body You rolled a
 An eight As you come down with your
battleaxe you all hear the resounding  as
it slams into the wood splintering and breaking
it a bit You can see a brief gap where youve
managed to get two of the wooden boards to
separate and start to splinter Youre starting to
go full Shining on this door With that impact
over the next moment with repeated hits you
definitely can see your ability to cut through
this
through
 Yeah As thats happening the bindings are
now freed and Jusca brings his wrists up and rubs
them You can see where the strain has caused red
bloodied lines across from the tension where hes
pulled against the restraints Sallow this
longbearded chin out of neglect He looks up with
a faint glimmer of hope and a smile to the rest of
you and says Oh tha thank you
 Still in the cage yes
 Yeah
 Go for it Roll a d Plus your dex bonus
and your proficiency bonus Itd be plus six I think
 Its going to take you a bit Youre
starting to get through it but these cages are
designed to be hard to pick You take the better
part of a minute to do so In the meantime you
critical failure trying to go Shining on the door
what would happen
 In theory your axe goes wide and as
opposed to hitting the actual wood manages to
catch a heavy part of the metal reinforcement on
the door frame As it hits that heavy impact
sends reverberations through your arm and body
like the worst
 Tennis elbow youve ever felt At that
minute a voice familiar creeps in again in the
space around you What are you planning to
accomplish Youve killed a few bottombarrel
goons but youre in my domain now I had first
planned to make you into premium contraband when
finished However I may just keep you all as my
own personal pets Make a wisdom saving throw
 Make a wisdom saving throw please
  Okay In the moment the sense of
intimidation that your previous employer Lorenzo
had held over you and all the memories of what
transpired on the Glory Run Road not but a day
before goes running through your mind and you
feel that cold sense of fear that urge to run
creep up once more And you close your eyes
tightly and shrug it off For the first time in
the face of this

 That driving surge of vengeful confidence
beginning to burn in your belly once more
Eat shit fucko Then I go for the door again
That is a  on the door
 With your second swipe you bring both your
battleaxe and your warhammer together in one giant
swing both splintering the wood and the force of
the hammer splintering and breaking the two main
heavy wooden boards that hold the majority of the
right side of the door by where the hinges hold it
on As you break through the door breaks on the
top side and then swings open the apparatus
which keeps it there wedged in that door broken
partway and now rendered pretty much useless The
chamber in front of you is now left open for you
all to see where the three members both Protto
Ruzza and the third thug have vanished from the
chamber You see a table on the far end and a
brazier burning with a low flame and then the
stairway below has a set of bars like another
trap door that is a gate that seems to have closed
and locked behind them
shit Can we get this gate open
 All right At this point Shakste you do
manage to finally get the final tumbler of this
one lock to  It
opens up and with that the older gentleman steps
out takes one step towards you and
halfcollapses into your arms Hes drained of
energy 
 He rights himself Hes not unconscious he
just kind of stumbles and then gets back up and
leans against the wall breathing heavily
are in the chamber around the corner here that are
also trapped How are you with a lockpick
 He looks at you for about ten seconds
blinking the one eye he can blink
 I I make radishes grow

 Okay
 Sorry I havent noticed Im sorry I try
not to make eye contact They dont like it when I do
 He looks to you first kind of still taken
aback by the goblin face and the sharpened teeth
and the yellow eyes staring back But he calms
himself Uh I think those were the new projects
he took below
 Make an arcana check
 All right so Beau As you approach the gate
and go to look towards it the brazier flame flickers
 You do just as a gout of flame juts out in
your direction
 Well you realize what it is just as it
happens and youre like Oh
  A cone of flame just bursts forward
from the brazier in your direction I need you to
make a dexterity saving throw please
 You take ten points of fire damage as it
just incinerates past you And you take a step
back and the flame is now super small Like it
just expended a lot of its fire energy In the
brazier its just this low flicker And it begins
to burn brighter again
 All right go ahead and make a strength
check
 This is a straight strength check
unfortunately sorry
 Just roll a d add your
 
  It begins to bend You can see
now where theyve left it to lock behind it
latches when its dropped And where the latch has
stuck in its been locked underneath Its
starting to pull apart The metal is bending Its
not strong enough to break it will take another
round to do so but its starting to give
same thing
 All right
 Yes
 proximity
 So go ahead and make a strength check
  Beau as youre pulling your muscles
getting sore that the veins bulging in your arms
and your neck as youre yanking as hard as you
can
 Keg joins in with you and both of you
Ping
 The latches break off and it slides open
hitting the back wall leaving the stairs below
open This warm air is billowing up from beneath
at which point I need both of you to make a
dexterity saving throw as the brazier now has
regained its flame and then  sends forth
Another blast
 All right so you succeed Beau
unfortunately you do not So thats going to be 
points of fire damage to you Beau Six points to
you
 You take half damage though And you watch
as the flame now turns to a small cinder and
begins to  rise once more regenerating
its flame power
 There is a stone bowl of some kind that is
in a small pedestal that looks decorative on the
corner that contains a small ember But the ember
itself seems to be magical and whenever anybody
walks within a certain distance of it it just
sends a gout of flame in their direction
 Well first off you both are in proximity
you have the stairs below what are you doing
 All right both Beau and Keg vanish down the
stairs Just as the flames  over the
direction they were but it passes overhead
without any harm Youve managed to pull out of
the range of this brazier Nott
 Its pretty large
 And it looks like the stone bowl itself is
probably built into the pillar it would weigh far
too much for your Mage Hand to move
 Dispel Magic Dispel Magic is third level
 Dispel Magic is third level
 All right you watch as the flame blinks out
and is left dark

 Flameless Just a pile of blackened ash and
whatever source of this enchantment is rent useless
 So you all continue down the stairs after
your friends
  Just stops there Wings tucked up
long beak breathing really fast 
 So greater healing potion so thats d
plus 
 So 
 As you all begin to prepare the continuing
descent the stairs only travel down about  or
so feet before a low redlit chamber and steps
that go on beyond So you have a view down to
where the base is The Duchess begins to coast
down towards that space Thats where were going
to take a break
 About  minute break Well be back here in
just a moment guys For those who are watching
and you want to go ahead and be part of the
Wyrmwood giveaway head over to the Critical Role
Twitch channel at twitchtvcriticalrole enter
Well come back with the winners name at the end
of the break Well see you here in  minutes
 I love it Oh no she dropped her drink

 All righty Bringing us back in getting the
music going
 Any other preparation you guys want to do
before you descend the stairs
of mine
 ndlevel The base level
 All righty yeah So thats five temporary
sorry your hit point maximum increases by five
for the next eight hours for Beau Keg and who else
 There you go So thats five more maximum
hit points and you gain five hit points
 Yeah with that
 The Duchess heads down into the chamber and
it opens into a Tshaped chamber facing your
direction The stairs here descend down into this
area The room is lowlit with a red glow
emanating from two furnaces one on each side
there with faint red embers and bits of ash that
flicker out with small bits of flame
okay Just let her see whats
 Hovering right there
shadow
 All right make a stealth check for your
Duchess Roll a d add two
 Duchess perches right in the middle of the
floor right there Shes sitting right there You
think Duchess is hidden What else do you guys
do
right there in the middle can she see better than
if she were in the shadow
 From looking inside and seeing some of the
chamber Ill give you a little more of a view of
whats inside
 Theres this unnatural heat that fills the
interior of this chamber The air smells of coal
and burnt flesh
 Hopefully not proportionally Thatd be a
little sad
 You can see a number of metal brands hanging
against some of the walls where they are carried
over to these furnaces to be heated as torture
implements Further into the central chamber you
see a table You see in the middle of this
rounded chamber flanked by empty chairs this
stained stretch leathertopped table leather
draping over on each side almost to the floor You
see heavy chains dangling at the front and the
back of it as this is probably a location where
individuals are strapped to and tortured Two sets
of prison barred doors flank the opposite ends
that seem to have larger containment chambers
beyond there They look to be heavy and very
locked and barred What would you like to do
perch on my shoulder frankly
 Okay Duchess heads back up
coming
 This currently looks to be the only
continued path downward yes
 Individual
 All right you watch as this quiet
soundless image of Keg
 Youre making the clanging sound
 Make a performance check
 Her
 You angle yourself at the top of the
stairway to make sure that the sound of your armor
shaking
 At least disseminates into the air as much
as possible The image can only walk  feet
because that is the distance of the cube So the
illusion appears near the top or near the middle
of the stairs
 Descends and steps no more than ten feet out
from that and stops
 At this moment you hear projectiles
firing and you see as a bit of the dangling
leather over the table bows slightly And from the
opposite end something darts across the hallway
 One appears to emerge from underneath the
table out this way Another seems to shoot out
from this side
happening right now
 A moment passes before two more projectiles
fire These strange quick objects moving at a
rapid speed cross by Another one hits the bottom
of the stairs and clangs to a rest This one you
can actually see it It appears to be a rather
long solid crossbow bolt
 Not up in the stairway youd have to
descend into the actual chamber to see
 
 
 What are you doing
 All right
 Nott runs down the stairs Whos after Nott
 Are you stopping where Nott is You can move
a little further or elsewhere wherever you want
to go
 Over here
 Sure Who else is going where
 Keg you go ahead to the opposite wall
 Yeah you can get to just about there
 About there
 That will give you the basic idea
Shakste
Duchess over on Kegs shoulder
 All right so the Grand Duchess is currently
residing well say over here by Keg That will
represent he Grand Duchesss current position
 I mean youre staying back up in the
stairway
shoulder before this should feel much better
 Youre staying up behind Caleb up in the
hallway
 All right so your vision with the Duchess
you can see beyond that but you do not have
 The ability to actually hit something unless
you move down below Just a headsup
 All right Caduceus
 All right  At this moment make a
perception check Nott
 Yep as you came down the bottom of the
stairs
 You look down and see the empty chamber No
movement Beauregard you were looking around the
corner Make a perception check
 Keg you make a perception check as well
since youre both at the wall

 Keg as you hit the wall and glance around
the side you can see a humanoid shape ducked into
the shadows underneath the table in the center
who has pulled a heavy crossbow from underneath
the leather and aiming it at Nott which does
attempt to shoot That is a  to hit Whats your
armor class
 It hits For that Nott you take eight
points of piercing damage as a bolt hits right
towards the kneecap and actually sticks out the
side you almost falling to one edge
 There you go Reduce that to four Caduceus
as you walked around the corner you turn around
to see and come face to face with Ruzza who is
back up against the corner and looks towards you
and goes What the fuck
 No now we roll initiative
 Unveiling This guys down there Oh god
Caleb fell Lets go ahead and do this guys You
guys got a little cluster at the top of the
stairs goddamn it
 Yes All of you guys
 We have  to 
  to 
 We have Beau Than we have Caleb and Keg
going at the same time  to ten
 No All righty
 Ten to five
 What did you get Shakste
 Ohh All righty Oh man First with a
natural  on initiative order is Protto What at
first you thought was the thugs placement over
there turns out to be Protto who immediately
throws the table up and in front using it as a
block and as cover and then aims over again with
the heavy crossbow firing once again at Nott
Thats a  to hit
 Its only four piercing damage however
Really shitty damage roll
 Yeah were going back to the next combat
round You technically have not gotten your
reaction yet So no
 Well that finishes Prottos turn Nott
youre up
 Yeah Protto is currently now behind the
table and using it as cover
 No you cannot
 It was only a matter of time
 As you rush up and glance over you can see
Protto back against the table
 Pulling and stretching a bolt and goes
Huh
 No
 He instinctually slaps his hand up and it
knocks your arm and it causes the shot to go
firing off into the distance
 All right go for it
 Thatll hit thatll hit
 Ten points of damage This one sinks deep
into the left pectoral muscle of Protto piercing
through the armor and then gets stuck You hear
this expiring bit of air from the throat and he
seems like hes now having a hard time breathing
Hes hurt hes not at deaths door but hes
looking pretty hurt All righty Nott
 That ends your turn Beau youre up
 You do you see the other thug immediately
around that corner who is also firing from that
side across the way
  points of damage to him nice All
righty So with a heavy clock to the side he gets
thrown back into a torch that is in the wall That
catches flame a little bit on his shoulder
and he brushes it out He is looking both
distracted and pretty hurt
 Go for it second strike
  does hit
 Actually because he is just a lowly guy He
is not as well armored as his compatriots So
 Six damage Whack to the throat 
Hes now having a hard time inhaling Hes still
standing but
  does not hit unfortunately
 You go to hit a third time and hes a little
wiser and manages to push off Its a sloppy parry
but he manages to avoid most of the brunt of the
blow and pulls back That end your turn
 All right That brings us to Caleb and Keg
 You guys can choose who goes first
 You can get all the way over here
 All right
 Protto  You kick a chair to get
there but you can get right up against him
him Thats a natural one
 You swing with the battleaxe and it actually
gets wedged into the table You have to put your
foot on to manage to free it from the wood

  does hit Go ahead and roll damage
damage
 Seven points of damage to Protto With the
warhammer whack to the side of his head hes
pushed up against the side of the now
partiallysplintered table but he is still
keeping his cool about him Hes hurt but hanging
in there
action
 With your bonus action you can yeah
that
 Youre a dual wielder You got this girl
 Does not It just misses unfortunately
Protto manages to just duck out of the way as your
hammer slams into the bottom side of the table
where he has been using to break for cover And it
causes this huge open hole this gap almost like
a porthole in the top of the table where you can
see through As you manage to pull back your
hammer he kind of looks up through it right at
Nott Aah
 That finish your turn Keg
 All righty You now hear once again a
familiar voice
 Crawls from the space that says
 Do not kill them They have not earned the
mercy I give to their kaleidoscopic friends Let
them bleed and bring them in chains Oh the
horrors youll see And for Lorenzos turn

 Beau you hear this momentary vibration of
metal cutting through the air before That is
going to be a  to hit
 That is  points of slashing damage
 And  to hit
 So the first one strikes from behind The
pain shoots into your head and the second swing is
a backhanded wide throw with this glave now
seemingly more jagged and almost larger than the
one you saw before You manage to duck out of the
way and spin around and there hovering in the
air about ten feet off the ground you see what
seems to be the essence of Lorenzo but larger
You see in that same kind of thickened
leatherstudded bits of armor and bracers a
bulging muscular blueskinned body Where once
was a bulging bald head with tattoo two horns
emerge from the front Bits of a blackened beard
on once was a hairless humanoid form now curling
down the front of the chest and back of the head
one central plume behind You see there before you
what is Lorenzo or at least his true form

 And as you look up into the burning red eyes
of this strange ogreishlike demon creature which
you do not recognize all you hear is the chuckle

 As he flies back further into the chamber
about  feet up his back to the ceiling of the
interior thats going to end Lorenzos turn It
is now Ruzzas turn Ruzza who saw you first run
over there Caduceus is going attempt to cast
Confusion on you So I need you Caduceus to make
a wisdom saving throw
 As you watch Ruzza begin to slightly hum
this incantation there is a musical element that
is discordant and awful that seems to pierce
through your ears and into your brain For a
second your vision blurs the colors fade to gray
Up is down the world makes no sense and as you
clasp your eyes tight once more you manage to
shrug off the magical effect You look back at
Ruzza who notices that the spell has faded and
goes Oh shit
 And Ruzza is going to run the other
direction to try and get away from you Thats
going to end Ruzzas turn That brings us now to
the other thug The one that is up against you
 You know That thug is going to
 Is going to attempt to move away from you
 So take your attack of opportunity
  will hit go ahead and roll damage

 No He is not moving and he is unconscious

 Hes not very good up close and really
wanted that range and took a gamble and it didnt
work in his favor But thats okay All right
that finishes his go Caduceus youre up
 All right is that a constitution saving
throw
 Natural  plus two thats a 
Unfortunately no effect
 Youre trading spells both of you manage to
shrug each other off Its this massive duel of
wits and willpower
 Do you wish to move as well
 Shakste Your turn
 You do Right at the bottom of the stairs
with other people I think maybe I should take a
Sacred Flame or we could I mean shes standing
right behind me

 As the form of this Egyptian This
incredible ancient Egyptian woman from a world far
from here apparates on the other side of Ruzza go
ahead and make your attack roll with a d

 Got to get that 
  is not going to hit
 Thats all right You still have your action
if you wanted to
 All right The Duchess swings over and takes
a look It looks like this side of the chamber is
empty Theres nobody else waiting in the wings
 Well you have your action still
 And your movement yeah
towards the Duchess then But just halfway there
A little further over not so close to Ruzza
 Right so you can move over that way
more like it
 Ruzza does make a swing back with the sword
towards you as you move out of her melee range
Thats going to be a  Whats your armor class
 
 It does not actually hit you though
RZA Be glad
 You do manage to move away from the strike
no issue and you still have your action if you
wanted to use anything else like a cantrip
 Sacred Flame that is a natural  plus
three on the so it does not hit unfortunately
 Guys keep trading blows and dodging and
keeping it going Shakste that ends your turn
Back to the top of the round It is Prottos
turn
 Protto is going to go ahead and drop the
crossbow and pull out two shortswords
 Hes going to spin and dodge very quickly
quicker than you expected around you Keg still
staying in melee range
 Does not leave your range so does not
provoke He stays close enough but whips around
and is going to go ahead and make a strike with
each blade towards you That is going to be a 
 It just clangs off your armor no issue The
second strike is going to be a 
 Then as a no hes just going to leave
that there Thats going to end Prottos turn
Nott youre up
 No you are not
 Next to Keg Go for it
  does not hit unfortunately It goes
wide Scrapes against the stone in the ceiling
and ricochets into oblivion
 You have quite a bit more movement but
youll be coming into melee range with Ruzza But
Ruzza cannot make an attack of opportunity against
you because she already took one so you can keep moving
 Go for it
 Thatll hit Go ahead and roll damage with
sneak attack
 No sneak attack Yeah because Prottos
still next to Keg
 Prottos looking pretty hurt as he takes it
right in the abdomen  and his eyes are
going wide and  keeps looking up
Boss
 You get right next to Shakste and youre
now right up against the wall kind of between the
wall and Shakste
 That ends your turn That brings us to
Beau
 Over there next to Keg
 Yeah right on the opposite side
 As you vault over pushing that way the
floating entity that is Lorenzo whos coasting
about  feet above you and his wide form having
a tenfoot range with that glaive you just leave
his combat range and he takes a swing of
opportunity towards you That is going to be a
seven plus eight that is a  to hit
 You swing towards Protto Protto ducks out
of the way and your fist instead hits the edge of
Kegs armor Your hand goes back like that
 That does hit roll damage
 Nine points of damage against him
 Down on the back of the head and you can
see blood spatter out of the nose and mouth across
the stone Looks back at you like 
still standing
 All right How many ki points do you have
left now
 All righty
 Yeah so its the d
 All right damage on the next one
 The first hit clocks the side of Prottos
with his own blood His blade still out he looks
up at you grits his teeth and is the middle of
saying Im going to gut you 
and is out cold on the ground
 That your turn
 Okay And with that that brings us to Caleb
and Keg
 There
 All right

 From out of the ether a
forquiteawhileinvisible Caleb suddenly blinks
into view as these glowing embers begin to swirl
around his hands turning into a gouting burst of
flame Go ahead and roll for your strikes
 
 All of them burst across the muscular but
somewhat still rotund like a barrel of muscle and
blue rhinoceros hide You see the flames leave
these darkened blackened spots on his exposed
belly from the center of this leather armor
strapped like a harness around his torso He just
looks at you Glad you could join us
 Keg youre up
 Hes currently ten feet above you against
the ceiling
 You could try off of the table for a strike
if youd like
 All right go ahead and make an athletics
check
 You go and put your foot up onto the edge of
the splintered wood that is still damaged from the
impacts you had earlier and as you go to leap
the wood gives out from under you and the table
collapses so youre unable to quite get in range
with him at the moment
The RZA
 All right
 There you go Theres Ruzza right there you
manage to get into contact
seven I think that maybe hits
 Thatll hit
ten points of damage
 Nice
 Hmm
 That was more part of your movement so
 Two more times yeah
  hits
  does not hit
 Oh  points of damage There you go Oof
all right
that will be a  plus seven which I believe also hits
 That hits yeah Go ahead and roll damage
again
 All right got it Ruzzas taken a few hits
and youre now starting to see blood streaks
across the face from where the heavy flat side of
your warhammer has smashed into her jaw Some of
the teeth seem to be cracked and you see her spit
one out onto the stone All right I see your
game again Keg
 That ends your turn
 All right it is now Lorenzos turn
 All right And with that after the
scorching strikes that were against him Lorenzos
going to coast through the air arms out at the
side wielding the giant jagged glaive grinning
smiling towards Caleb  And is
going to arc down just enough to catch you on the
outside of the glaives range Two strikes against
you The first one is going to be a  to hit
 That is going to be  points of slashing
damage The next is going to be a  to hit
 That is  points of slashing damage
 And with that hes going to go ahead and
shift further
 Back just keeping an eye Keeping his
options open making sure hes not too far from
anybody Thats going to go ahead and end
Lorenzos turn its now Ruzzas turn Ruzza is
going to expend a level three Hold Person
 Against Keg
 And against Beau who are the two that are
currently most visible and bludgeoning her allies
I need you both to make wisdom saving throws

 This is a unique setup for the live show so
thank you for being patient
for
 Exactly You manage to shrug off the effect
You feel it encasing your brain your body begins
to tighten for a second before you manage to have
it have no effect However behind you over there
Beaus body seizes and freezes up
 Ruzzas going to as a bonus action look up
and say All right Lorenzo I think its time you
really er really show them what youve got
buddy Shes going to give a d inspiration die
to Lorenzo
 Ending Ruzzas turn Caduceus youre up
 I like weird
 You are
 All right I believe thats a wisdom saving
throw for Ruzza
 Its a  plus two so  Whats your DC
 So thats half damage from the Spirit
Guardians
 How much total
 So four Four points to Ruzza
 Shes at half speed Got it Cool Spirit
Guardians is up Thats your action
 I dont think you have much in the way of
bonus actions
 You can yes
 You cannot because youve already cast a
level one spell Only a cantrip
 That ends your turn Shakste Youre up
 So what is the Command word on that one
that means you cant do nothing You just got to
stand there youve got to do nothing
 Well youve got Halt which means they dont
move and take no actions Okay is that what
youre doing
television with Starsky  Hutch When they say
freeze you dont do shit You just sit there and
do nothing
 Its a natural  plus one its a 
Whats your DC
 Resists the command Im sorry You still
have your Nefertiti
lets see if we can knock out The RZA
 Go for it Make the attack roll
 Yeah thats not going to hit
 Nefertitis still trying to apparate She
hasnt quite taken her full form yet The
spiritual energy hasnt coalesced enough to have
an impact but shes on her way
 Would you like to move
move
 All right so that ends Shakstes turn Top
 Currently Keg is yes
  hits yeah

 She has to make a constitution saving throw
to see if she can maintain That was almost a 
but turned into a three So the Hold Person wore
off

 Yes though hurt very badly
 That does hit yes
 Seven points of damage
 All righty Ruzza takes the next bolt the
first one strikes right in the sternum area and
sinks in rather deep Instinctively she reaches
up and grabs it  looks over in
the direction where it came from and at that
moment the second crossbow bolt goes right into
the throat She opens her mouth trying to make a
sound and instead nothing but blood pours out of
the corner
 Youll back up a little bit you said
 Over by Shakste
 Or all the way to the furnace
 There you go That ends your turn that
brings us to Beau
 Yeah sure You manage to
 That is your action Because you have to
grab it and its a whole motion to get it up there
 Patient Defense good All righty Caleb and
Keg
 You have ten more feet you can go in either
direction
 You have two more spaces You can go near
Caduceus
 Roll for the attack
 All righty That does hit exactly

 Flames burst across you see the leather
cracks in one part of the harness He just grins
back at you
 That ends your turn Keg
table
 Possibly yeah You give a little jump as
you swing hes just in reach with the tables help
  hits
 Six points of damage nice
hit And one more time for the cheap seats that
will not hit Okay go ahead
 Aw But you still get one swing that cuts
through and carves through part of the outer leg
and calf of Lorenzo The leg gets pushed back a
bit from the impact as hes floating His large
almostcorpulent form though of solid muscle
just sitting there enduring it His face focus
comes from where Caleb was back towards you and
says Well glad you could join the party Keg
That ends your turn
 That makes it Lorenzos turn
 No Youve got to jump to hit him but hes
not within your melee range when youre standing

 Spirit Guardian still slows his movement I
believe Does it say walking speed or just walking
 Has to make a wisdom save which is a 
plus four 
 So take half damage roll for damage He
still takes damage You also watch as Lorenzo
coasts through the air some of the wounds that he
suffered seem to be slowly sealing up
 Nothing more than just terrible radiant
damage
 It blasts him and as he pulls into the
area he goes Ooh Thats not going to do and vanishes
 Caduceus its your turn
 I dont know do you want to go see
 Thats your movement can get you that close
You can use your action to make a perception check
if you want to glare through
 There
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
because there is no light source inside that
chamber and you do not have darkvision which I
remembered
 Make your roll
  Looking through its hard to see but
you can make out a few shapes they look to be
humanoid figures that are still gagged and chained
on the farback side of the interior there
 Yeah Youre peering in very closely to try
and make out the details of an area with no light
source in the middle of combat
 Okay
 You should really get that checked out Sam
All right finishing Caduceuss turn Shakste
youre up
will move into the chamber and check the other
side of this chamber now that its
 Whereabouts do you want to go
we can get yeah
 Thats about as far as you can get with your
movement
ahead and go to the end of the chamber there
 Right over here
 Make a perception check for the Duchess with
a disadvantage
 Actually no We decided that the Duchess
design had darkvision so just a straight roll
Whatever you rolled
 Its hard to make out anything in there
 There is a chamber in there but theres not
enough light to make out the details of it
unfortunately Does that finish your turn You can
move your Nefertiti if youd like

any light in that chamber that Thaumaturgy could
maybe illuminate
 There is a candelabra that has low light
over there that is giving a faint glow and there
are two torches in the sides here that are also
giving off this low redorange
 Nothing in the room no
can make a little more light in the room
 As you do so the flames flare up and the
long shadows stretch from beyond the bars into the
chamber and you can see an unconscious figure on
chained and gagged facing away from you You
cant see any more details than that
working on these locks at all can I
 Not with using Thaumaturgy as your action
no
 That finishes your turn Back to the top
Nott what are you doing
 You dont see anybody in there You could
make a perception check if you want to use that as
your action Its up to you
 Maybe Roll a high stealth check maybe
Well see
 Good to know
 Okay good to know What are you holding
 You got it Beau
 You got it Caleb Keg
 Yeah were keeping that rule for our game
 Absolved of all dam no
 Roll for an attack with disadvantage
 It just burst into stone
 Keg
indication of what Lorenzo is doing
 Its possible
 So you use your action to make a perception
check
 You just looking over your shoulder see
some sort of shift across the stone like the
pattern just moves and quakes ever so faintly
unnaturally against what would be the rather still
though warm air
 No in the back of the chamber right here
Thats your action
 Well it was your action to try and perceive
where this
 You cant take a bonus action attack unless
youve used your attack action before it unfortunately
 You can go there if you want Or there
 Okay That finishes your turn
 As Keg walks over saying pointing
that direction telling the group
What do you tell them
on the stone over here
 As Keg walks forward pointing in that
direction a familiar voice rings out right before
you and says Oh little girl youre making
crafting this nightmare too easy With that
theres this curl of blueish arcane energy right
before you Your hair begins to blow back from the
force as a cold temperature begins to gather
directly ahead With that in a brief instant
Lorenzo appears before you in his large demonic
form and unleashes
 A Cone of Cold
 You do it happens simultaneously
 Go ahead and make your attacks
 Well you only make one attack no two
attacks Ive allowed that house rule Held
attacks get the extra attack feature so go for
it So both hit
 Nice
 Theyre throwing stars yeah Sorry
 A total of  damage from those two strikes
Nott you also got one as well
 With a what
 Okay yeah no
 Okay I need Caduceus Beau Shakste and
Keg to all roll constitution saving throws please
 What was that
  You just succeed
  Nice
 Beau and Shakste you each suffer  points
of cold damage
 Nefertiti vanishes Thats  points of cold
damage to both Keg and Caduceus
 You see the body of the thug you had killed
earlier the body of Ruzza and the body of
Protto Frozen statues corpses on the ground
turned to sheer flashfrozen ice There on the
ground covered and encased in pieces of frozen air
and moisture from the vicinity the unconscious
and dying bodies of Beauregard and Shakste
 Lorenzo glancing back down at Keg who
manages to shrug most of this off says Dont
worry Youre all next And begins to back away
You do get an attack of opportunity
of opportunity
Thats an 
 That hits
 Seven damage All righty With that it goes
to Caduceus turn
 Spare the Dying is an action
 Oh Because thats right

 Cure Wounds is the first level
 You can
 At what level
 What level did you cast it at
 So its d
 So  plus five yeah thats Jesus 
 hit points
 Ending Caduceus turn Shakste you are
stable You can still move if you want
 There
 There you go Caduceus turns up Shakste
you dont have to make any death saving throws
because Spare the Dying so youre fine but
thats your turn To the top of the round Nott
youre up
  hits Roll damage
 There goes Nott That brings us to Beau
What are you doing You come to consciousness
Youre prone You have to use half your movement
to get up
 
 You are ten feet from Lorenzo
 Roll damage
 Im going to use my little Shapeways dice for
this one
Thats a plus six constitution modifier
on this one but it rolled a natural four

 Yeah that hits
 If anyone wants to physically attack him
Yeah in melee Or actually for stunned attack
rolls have advantage yeah
 Thats my fault for not having him fly to
the ceiling last turn
 Caleb and Keg
 Any higher up the stairs and you wont be
able to see him
 You have advantage on the attack roll
  That hits that just hits Sorry I was
doing math in my head
  does not hit Unable to penetrate the
hide with that third strike It hits the outside
of the muscular blubber on his giant torso and it
shimmies and shakes and then tightens All right
that ends your turn
 All right it is now Lorenzos turn Lorenzo
shrugs off the stun at the end but can do nothing
else on his turn and is still locked As soon as
he gets his ability to speak back goes Oh
yall being tricksy I like it Thats going to
bring us to Caduceus
 You do yes
 No because its not your healing spell
  Its worth an inquiry Most
definitely
 You could push it The table is righted now
so its an empty space
 Okay Ill give you some cover on that
Finishing Caduceus turn Shakste you are
conscious now
 Whats the range  You can see everybody
but Caleb You can heal everybody but Caleb
because he went way up the stairs You dont even
know where he is You came to consciousness and
Calebs gone
 d plus your wisdom modifier which is
four So roll a d
 How much
 Everyone but Caleb heals seven hit points
 Are you going to stay put Shakste Or are
you going to move somewhere
 No you lost her unfortunately
 Thats all right You can still move if you
want to its up to you
into the testicle area No go around Yeah there
you go Then into the testicle
 All righty That ends your go Top of the
 He is engaged with both Beau and Keg
 That hits
 That bolt impacts and now that you guys are
the wear and tear in Lorenzos form is really
starting to show Wounds are theyre still
closing with each round that comes back to his go
but the wounds closing seems to be slowing or at
least the wounds are getting more and more deep
and dangerous Hes looking quite haggard and wounded
 Beau youre up
 Go for it
 Yeah that hits roll damage
  just hits
 Nice Hes looking real hurt
 Keg
 You go to swing now being wounded and
looking a glare of desperation in the burning
red eyes of Lorenzo You swing and he grabs the
hilt of your weapon as it swings downward and
holds it aloft and in your face and goes Try
it
 No The other hand grabs the other weapon
and youre just locked in that moment now
 Thatll hit roll damage
 All righty

action surge

 You wish you had saved it She used it last
session and they didnt take a short rest Sorry
guys
 Caleb
  does not hit
 Roll damage
  points of damage
  Fuck
How do you want to do this

 You watch as Lorenzo in desperation begins
to take flight Both you and Beau try and swing
for his form but it doesnt matter at this point
As he attempts to try and make for an exit the
flames curl across the body leaving ash
dissipating as the outer sides of his form begin
to fall away into dust and blackened shale As
both of your weapons and fists swing upward they
hit what feels like rock and scatter it like ash
against both sides of the walls The torso falls
and tumbles to the ground one arm still dragging
Lorenzo towards the stairs in this last minute bit
of desperation before it tumbles onto its back
the flame curling and burning away the rest of his
face and jaw The hand left there limp before
that eventually is taken too leaving nothing
but charred charcoal behind

 One tactical fuck up on his part and that
stunning strike turned that completely around

 Go ahead and make an arcana check
 Definitely dont want to make tea from this
 There are certain creatures that are you
would assume distantly related to giant kin
Youre used to seeing the ogreish mighty beasts
This was something entirely different Youve
heard terms thrown around like ogre mage but
this is commonly referred to in childrens nursery
rhymes the kind that are meant to scare kids
from going out at night as an oni
 You glance inside that additional chamber
and you can now see within that chamber there is
a singular figure on the opposite side of the
wall chained up Your eyes adjust and you pull
the candelabra close and you can see the familiar
dark gray leather and white hair of a chained and
unconscious Yasha on the far end

 Go ahead and make a check Do you have
thieves tools
 You take a while with it before you realize
this particular type of metal seems to be made to
endure such spells
 That little boost of confidence was just
enough for you to find every tumbler within one
quick attempt and with a swift 
it hangs open to the inside
 There you see three figures You see one
that appears to be an older woman chained and
gagged This is a familiar pattern with all of
these You can see theyve dealt with magic users
and people who have special abilities in the past
so as a precaution they do this to every prisoner
they can There you see on the ground as well a
familiar bluehaired horned ally as well as a
taller more rugged halforc friend

 Thank you for reminding me
 Okay
 Theyre all unconscious yeah At this point
you can see coming down the stairs behind you
Caleb the older fellow that you had saved earlier
with the swollen eye Behind him the dwarf and
the child He seems to have been able to free them
from the cage and they come down and say Is it
over Is it safe
  onto your shoulder
people are just good
 One is open the other is still closed
 Yeah thatll do it It opens up and on the
inside of the chamber there is just Yasha
 Gathering up the rest of those who were
captured by the Iron Shepherds Shakste shepherds
them off to their proper locations free and far
from the confines outside of the Dwendalian
Empire The rest of you with your friends in tow
make your way back towards Shadycreek Run and to
the rest of the morning light which now begins to
slowly curl over the distant mountains A long
evening exhausted and tired You look forward to
enjoying comfort alcohol and whatever else
transpired thereafter

 All right Well then were going to finish
tonights episode there

around and take a bow Thats how you do it

 Thank you all so very much for coming and
for watching Man he was supposed to get away

 Ugh Well done Hey sometimes I kill a
party member sometimes you kill mine I guess it
works out well But no in all seriousness guys
this is perpetually continuously becoming a more
and more surreal experience This wonderful game
with wonderful friends

 There arent words to describe how much this
crazy phenomenon of family means to us and thank
you for your support your engagement your
support and engagement of each other This is a
testament to a new era in storytelling that we all
get to share in

 Thank you Khary for coming and joining us
for the live episode

 Pretty much came straight here from being in
the UK this past weekend so he was barely home
and then flew back out to be here with us Hiding
the whole day so nobody would see him so he could
make the surprise drop Thank you so much Ashly
thank you for coming along with us for this crazy journey

 Im just rambling now You guys are amazing
thank you for coming Hope you have a wonderful
night We have our panel tomorrow Go check out
The Invulnerable Vagrant at Gen Con Love you
guys and is it Thursday yet Good night


 And welcome back everybody That was a
unique rush Last we left off were going to do
a little bit of time bending here so we can make
sure we get everything we want to Last we left
off The Mighty Nein upon heading towards the
second leg of their journey completing a task for
The Gentleman of who they had left Zadash to earn
money and praise with found themselves in the
outskirts of Hupperdook where three members of
their team were captured in the middle of the
night by a group of traveling slavers
 Oh the amnesia arc Youve got to have one
at every point in the party We lost one we gain
one I know These three members Yasha Jester
and Fjord all captured by the Iron Shepherds
this group of slavers and dragged north to
Shadycreek Run outside of the laws of the Empire
The rest of the members finding new allies in
Keg the dwarven fighter Nila the firbolg druid
and a brief reappearance of the fantastic human
cleric Shakste These friends together managed
to storm the gifted stronghold of The Sour Nest
attack and destroy one by one this team of
slavers leaving The Iron Shepherds down to their
last few in the subterranean basement where these
cages contained their friends chained and held in
darkness There the battle with Lorenzo
revealing his final form after stalking them
invisibly from the air for their entire journey
through that fortress revealed himself to be an
oni a terrible creature of nightmare and entirely
unnatural strength and capability However
through some ingenuity fast thinking and some
incredible luck Lorenzo found himself unable to
escape The members of your team knocked
unconscious brought back from the brink and a
final blow was dealt by Caleb as his arcane
cinders burned away the final remnants of
Lorenzos demonic form There as you began to
inspect the interior of the subterranean chamber
you discovered in one set of these prison cells to
the left there lie chained Jester and Fjord In
the other an unconscious Yasha With that you
made your way through the bars unlocking the
mechanisms that held them at bay and have now
come back face to face with your taken friends
with one new friend and one missing And thats
where we come in Jester you and Fjord both in
the chamber after enduring the sounds of other
captors being punished being tortured and a
nearby friend enduring it silently just to
frustrate them Youve been trying desperately to
contemplate ways of escape to try and find a way
to relieve yourself of your bindings to no avail
Then suddenly theres the sound of battle
weapons scraping on stone and metal and flesh
screams familiar voices flashes of light the
air rushing warm and cold with the nearby blasting
of arcane energies divine forces and powers
brought in to sustain and snuff life and then
silence You hear the voices come close and as
you barely manage to move over and glance over
your shoulder you watch as the bars swing open to
the chamber where youre held and the tiny form
 You pull off what is essentially a thick
leather gag that has been keeping her from
speaking
 Theyre bound by chained manacles but well
say given the fact that there is no immediate
pressure of time you take your time with the
bindings using your lock picks and manage to
free her of the manacles
 As you guys had noticed at this point
youve glanced over in the other chamber and you
do see faced away and lying within the other
chamber is Yasha You manage to eventually get it
open and inside she is lying there motionless
 Mmhmm Its really relatively easy to
brutalized There are gashes and tear marks in the
flesh where hooks were pulled through there are
streaks of dried blood on her But shes not
unconscious within an inch of her life Shes a
hardy woman and shes endured a lot and then
some and she lies here unconscious before you
still bound in manacles
 The wounds seal up and she notably becomes
healthier Some scars still remain but shes
further from the brink But still unconscious
 You buried him along the Glory Run Road
 You turn around and theres Keg awkwardly
standing in the back of the chamber hearing all
this You can see the guilt in her eyes and she
goes Im going to go join Caduceus Pulls out a
cigarette and lights it as she follows him up
 Go ahead and make an insight check

 You guys were the first ones that were you
were the prime candidates to be broken
 As you guys bring her up and you look for
other people who were in the cages you notice
that theyre all missing Shakste has ushered
them out of the complex to get them to safety as
he said he would
 Caduceus and Keg are up there sharing a
conversation feeling like the proverbial outsiders
 I love it Keg is going through the corpses
of the different thugs and rolling them for
change Shes got a cigarette hanging out of the
mouth feeling through pockets Whos helming the
investigation of the stronghold
 All right so go ahead and roll twice and
roll with advantage
 Well no it gives you advantage to spend a
ki point to do it
  all right Over the next hour or so you
guys begin to tear through If someone wants to
take note of this these are the things that you
find
 All right Amongst the bodies and materials
that have been set aside to equip those who exist
two longswords two crossbows three shortbows
and eight sets of partially damaged leather armor
Theyre all used theyre not the highest quality
Theyre functional
 Possibly depending on where you take them
Thats the low end Because you got higher than a
 you do find the bottom floor is a number of
the the second basement floor you find a
plethora of torture implements Plenty of brands
and small blades and hooks You find flaying
knives Its a terrible array If you were to
choose to take any you could write down torture
implements Should you be so inclined You do find
on the bodies of the
 Yeah On the bodies of everyone who all
the bodies that still remain here as the body of
Lorenzo is destroyed other than the glaive you
find  gold pieces across all those bodies
 In the storage chests that are in various
bunkers in the top floor you also find a potion
that looks like a weird syrupy quicksilver type
of a liquid on the inside of this little glass
vial and you find this receipt
 Yeah Keg has spoken Thats the opposing
house to House Mardun
 Yeah
 Could take them down in a place that has
law But it may have some use you dont know
 You did get the baseline  DC though in
going through the upstairs chamber that you found
to be Lorenzos chamber Through the bed you find
 gold pieces scattered in some of the shelves
near the bed unit beneath where theres the
platter containing the remains of some young
creature Then beneath tucked underneath the bed
and up into the slats you find a heavy leather
bag of some kind You pull it out and what you
find is
 You can check if you want to Go ahead and
make an investigation check
 Not trapped just well hidden You do find
this thick leather satchel As you pull it back
its well made It has some stains on it it looks
like Some more of a crimson history some that
look like general dirt wear and tear
 The stitching is really well done and the
front of it looks like a face the way its designed
 It has a little flap that opens up yeah
You look inside and it looks like an empty bag
 No gold
 The temperature felt consistent with the
temperature of the room youre in
 It vanishes into the satchel

 Nothing comes out
 You dont get any stones no
 No jewelry
 Which is great too when you see the dirty
coat and the giant bright hot pink haversack
over the shoulder Its a pretty great visual
 Looking through not much of a reader Not a
lot of readers in here The few that had any sort of
magical persuasion none of it was
knowledgebased Most of it was instinct or
natural innate ability
 Sure
 You guys did together This is the next
hour hour and a half of you guys going through as
much as you can as quickly as you can because
you are still not supposed to be seen or found in
connection with this You all eventually gather
everything and come back to Caleb
 You would gather at this time its maybe
close to three in the morning Sunrise is not that
far away
 Yeah Caduceus is in the kitchen cooking
and you begin to hear some pots rattle around and
you smell some nice scents of fried herbs and
veggies and some other nonmeat based food preparation
 Including these guys
 Including Shakste if Im recalling
Nine
 Nine
 At this point you guys have gathered
together well say
 Caduceus eventually comes and joins you
guys with platters of all sorts of wellcooked
wellspiced organic vegetables and whatever else
you happen to have on you
 True
 So what are you casting Caleb
 What are you casting
 Identify okay
 Well its got a bottom
 Make sure you know everything it can do so
you guys dont
 I think you guys are probably not hanging
down in the torture dungeon now which has very
low red light from occasional lowburning wall
sconces The main chambers are welllit with
torches in the hallway areas and the interior
chambers are a little lowlit So there is light
theres just not a lot
 You look inside and it looks pretty empty
 No noise
 Okay As you pull the bag insideout it
jolts away from one side of your grasp and a
bunch of things spill out of it onto the ground

 From the bag
Whats in there What was it
 The heavy noise that draws you guys over to
this involves collecting  platinum pieces that
were in the bag

 Four additional sets of manacles
 It was just casting a spell and she wasnt
always touching it necessarily She was just near
it and sometimes would touch it
 About two dozen teeth clatter to the ground
from varying backgrounds and levels of decay A
rusted
 There is a red gem
 a wellcarved red gem
about that big not quite a ruby called a
corundum gem A sealed envelope a waxsealed
envelope but as part of the seal theres a coin
pressed into the seal
 Thats what it looks like
 In fact you recognize it immediately This
is called a galley
 A galley is specifically a gold piece that
is produced along the Menagerie Coast
 Make an investigation check
 Okay It does not appear to be trapped
 Its a little more like the grease stain of
somebody who was holding it not necessarily any
bloodstain Like Lorenzo maybe had grasped it
while a little greasy
 Its an I
 The red gem is just a squareshaped hewed
gem That looks like a crystal sphere with a
giant hacked crack across the front of it
 Its really familiar to you though
 Quenpillar is a month yes Its the next
month
 The Wayfarers Cove youre also familiar
with Its one of the three main shipping yards of Nicodranas
 Its pretty damn close
 You bring out what looks to be
a really nice pearl
 You get the sense that its not a real
pearl This is a pretty cheap piece of jewelry
 Theyre called merrow
 You have no idea who that is Youve lived
in the town for a while and you know a lot of
things about the locations but you havent
traveled around Nicodranas The people you know
are those that have come in and out of where you
grew up and that name does not ring a bell
Neither does the Captain
 I would like Caleb and Beauregard and
Fjord actually the three of you to roll
intelligence checks
 Thats true So just Beauregard
 Mmhmm
 Okay
 No
 That is a real coin yes It is a gold coin
if youd like to take it off of the envelope you
may add one gold to your
 Fjord is expecting
 Which one
 The Cult of the Caustic Heart That was if
I recall with Calianna
 Looking over them it appears that one of
them would be similar to a tusk yes
 Sure
 At the moment Looking at the specifics of
this
 It looks like a solid dome of faintly
orangeish brown colored energy and you can pass
through it It feels like theres nothing there
except for the temperature on the inside Its
nice and comfortable
 It goes through
 Yeah hes a tall fellow
 The dome is about a ten foot radius
 A voice on the outside goes Uh whered
everyone go
 Can she come in
 Keg steps in You see the dirt smeared side
of the face of this really intense squarejawed
dwarf woman with what was once five oclock shadow
that is now coming into some decent stubble now
Short reddish brown hair Currently in the last
elements of a hand rolled cigarette in full
armor smattered with blood
 Hey so I guess we saved you
 
 Im just happy to make up for past
mistakes
 Teeth and coin and gem all come clattering
into the middle of your circle
 The potion that you found earlier is
magical
 The red gem is also magical
 The sets of manacles emit a faint magical
aura
 Meat hook is not magical
 There are bolts If you wanted to restock
theres probably close to  bolts
 Probably about a hundred arrows
 Id say yeah If youre looking around I say
you find an errant dagger or two
 Two daggers
 Not too difficult to locate in this space
 Glancing over the chains you can only begin
to fathom how many people have been put in that set
 Its pretty big
 Its a set of manacles Its like two wrist
manacles
 Its two cuffs for the wrists that goes
behind the back and then two cuffs that go around
the ankles and then chains that connect them
Its maybe about   pounds of metal
 You guys all resting up for the evening As
the sun is right about now Caleb rising Its
 You guys have been doing all this through
the night
 Yeah
 Okay As you focus and attune to the weapon
you feel the essence of the blade that you had
previously bound yourself to begin to slip Faint
interior rumbling of your ribcage begins to feel
like a heavy bass that is quaking on the inside of
your torso Its uncomfortable at first and then
you realize its this burrowing for lack of a
better term appetite with the previous weapon now
gone and that void that hunger focusing in
Youre looking at the blade and you blink and as
your eyes open that shadowed depths are around
you once more You look around for an instant and
all you see is the deep dark recesses of some
endless ocean You look down at the blade in your
grasp the Summers Dance blade and then blink
once more and youre back in the chamber and its
gone from your hand
 Yeah
 You guys watched as he focused on it over
time the blade seemed to fade away It looks like
the exterior begins to turn to ash and crumble
but then nothing hits the ground below it Then
its gone
 All those who were paying attention and
hadnt gone to sleep yet
 With that awkward silence you see Keg
staring straight out the guilt on the face of the
mention of Molly once more Im going to have
to Im just going to leave you guys to rest Im
going to take some me time Then backs out of the
dome and one quick glance at Beau as she exits
 Okay
 Your sketchbook is
 Okay You all finish a very necessary long
nights rest Coming to consciousness as the dome
vanishes exposing the center of the base floor
walkway where Caleb had set up both the
protections of his spells and the dome in the
first place Beau has not returned
 You all wake up The front door which is
right across from where you are is partially ajar
partway open
 Okay Make a perception check
 You walk outside Its early afternoon now
Its chilly Snowfall has set in now and there
is a faint snowfall over the entire grounds of the
interior of this courtyard where the trees have
been cleared for the construction of The Sour
Nest is just white You see it gathering up on
the tops of the walls on the outside Its almost
beautiful if not for the connotation of where you
are All around you on the outskirts of the wall
you can see where the white is dusting over the
purple and grays of the Savalierwood that
surrounds you You do notice across the way the
open gates on the southern side of the wall that
enters into the courtyard are also partially ajar
You see faint footsteps leading from the gate to
where you are
 They are and theyre heading away from
you
 Okay Beau at one point you did wake up
this morning Halfheartedly as some people arent
as stealthy in their exits as others
 Open one eye and glance over and the door
closes
 All right You all come to consciousness as
Caleb wakes you On the outskirts of the dome by
where Nott was sleeping there is a tiny little
piece of paper
 There is underneath the paper where you
pulled it away you saw it was a medallion that
was hanging from the bottom of her warhammer It
has a symbol of a star or a sun of multiple points
sticking out on all sides
 All right
 Have to have one character in every campaign
that grows facial hair for no reason
 Beau you wake up and there is a letter
 Those letters were actually written by Ashly
Burch for you guys
 Yeah
 It was left below yeah
 Yeah you have it Its a wicked looking
weapon
 It is not magical
 Interesting point too Some of the corpses
you passed by in the middle of the arena were
starting to be overgrown with fungus Its quite
disgusting
 All right
 If you go ahead and check the carts still
appear to be saddled up with the cages When you
approach it looks to be small bundles of produce
and various packs but upon reaching the edge and
peering in your face immediately goes past the
illusion and you see the tarp a heavy tarp thats
laid over the cages Pulling it open the cages
are still there in the cart yes
 Best you can tell whatevers under the tarp
is invisible Everything in the cart
 Theyre pretty large cages Theyre foot
by foot by foot Theyre stacked up two at a time
 You can yeah You pull off the cages and
pull off the tarp and they all come out of the
illusion and theyre normal
 You get under the tarp and youre under a
tarp
 You see all your friends getting under a
tarp
 Nope
 Wait you guys pulled the cages and the tarp
off the cart
 Currently nothing seems to be changed The
cart still looks like its filled with some small bundles
 The cart is where the illusion is focused
As Jester steps into the cart she vanishes
 Okay
 What it is is its a localized illusion to
give a fake interior appearance of a cart but
that enchantment has been made permanent through
some other magical means
 From Shady Creek Its only about an hour or
so From Ophelias its about an hour and a half
by foot By cart youre not too sure These woods
can be thick and hard to get through in large carts
 Slower by cart because youre having to
ferry it through some more difficult terrain
 All right You grab two of the horses that
are still set up on the exterior you get them
forded to the cart You guys throw your cushions
and blankets into the back Whos going to be
guiding the cart There is still the front where
the actual seat is where you can hold the reins
and steer it where it goes
 All right so Caduceus and Caleb up front
the rest in the back
 Two horses on the cart two horses that are
free ridden by
 All right That puts Jester and Nott in the
cart with Yasha With that you pull the cart free
from where it has sunken into some of the
cold mud that seems to have closed around the
wheels as the frozen temperatures of the snowfall
caused it to harden Eventually it pulls itself
out of that section on the side of the Sour Nest
and begins trekking cutting its way leaving
little tracks in the snow along with the hoof
prints With that Beauregard you jump off and
quickly push the gates outside from the courtyard
out into the Savalierwood With that you begin to
trek back towards Shady Creek Run in the mid
afternoon of this now somewhat cold snowfallen
portion of the day And thats where well go
ahead and take a break Picking up with you guys
approaching the fantastic Estate Sybaritic Before
we get to there were going to go ahead and do

and we love her and we want her back ASAP
 Yes
 You all begin to make your way through this
section of the Savalierwood following the best
pathways you can for the next hour hour and a
half before you begin to break into the North
Clover area of the city Trying to maneuver
around carefully so as to not be conspicuous
Thankfully the enchantment on the cart enables
you to do so without much issue However it is
also a very populated area with friends and
enemies of the house you are traveling to Who
wants to be responsible for trying to remain
inconspicuous
 Yes well you still have four of you who
are out in the open Two on horseback and two
actually bringing the cart forward
 Perfect
 Okay
 All righty
 This part in the afternoon its bustling
enough towards the central main Clover Street
With your preparation it doesnt seem that you
catch too much attention thankfully You do
eventually make your way to the outskirts of the
twostory Estate Sybaritic where you see the
familiar dark red wood and the fence with sixinch
spear tips still aggressively daring anybody to
vault over or make entry The guards that you had
previously encountered when you first arrived
immediately turn and you see the two on the
inside of the courtyard and the one thats
outside of the gate as another one appears to be
stepping into his position he had left for a
moment All look over as you begin to approach
get their crossbows ready One of the guards at
the very front the one thats on the outside of
the wall already begins to approach with his hand
on the side of a sheathed blade Who goes there
 Please wait here Ill be right back Im
going to go check He closes the gate behind him
locks it leaves you there and the two other
guards keep their crossbows at the ready but not
aimed Just careful and ready to go
 A few moments pass and the front doors to
the estate open once more The guard returns
approaches unlocks the gate opens it Very
well you may enter Bring your He opens the
other side of the gate but it looks like its not
quite wide enough to get the full cart into it
Youll have to leave your cart here
 We do not Well watch it dont worry
Well keep an eye on it Its not going anywhere
 Yes Its my job Im stationed literally
right here
 All right we can muster a few additional
hands
 Ill go ahead and put in the request
 Do not worry
 He gives an awkward stare Very well The
mistress is waiting for you He steps inside The
guards flank behind as the rest of you Nott
Yasha and Jester are staying within the cart The
rest of you make your way through the courtyard
into the main chamber into the familiar interior
Noticing this for the first time this beautiful
estate looks like it was built from imported wood
a dark redbrown maroon wood color You can see
elements of gold leafing in some of the designs
have been carved at the edges where different
large wall areas come together and theres a
slight pillar that separates it from panel to
panel The closer you get to it you also see that
theyve been weathered over time Some of the wood
is starting to warp a bit and upon closer
inspection upkeep is better seen at a distance
You enter the interior of the warm foyer you can
see the staircase that ascends upward You can see
the portraits of figures that seem to be members
of this same family It is both beautiful and
imposing to enter this chamber The energy here
seems very tense While youve only seen a handful
of guards you feel like there are more eyes on
you than meets the eye A moment later stepping
down the staircase you hear the footsteps of
Ophelia Mardun You see a voluptuous tiefling
woman with dark ashgray skin vibrant yellow
eyes pupilless sharpened fangs that curl down
from the top of her teeth slicked back long black
hair that seems to almost meet the back of her
ankles Her horns curve backward and go straight
up towards the rear of her head Her coat this
time not of the same colonial garb you had seen
before but appears to be wearing a long deep
maroon robe that drags down the steps behind her
Its tight across in the front Shes in more of a
leisurely appearance but she descends one hand
on the front of the robe the other slightly
gliding down the banister looking over this
strange bunch that have entered Recognizing you
two not recognizing you two and says so as she
begins to descend down the final bit of the
staircase I see some familiar faces but
strangely some I do not Who are your friends
before I come any closer
 Completed you say Are you to tell me that
these Iron Shepherds have been dealt with
 And what proof have you brought me
 Fetch it for me One of the guards comes
over and puts his hands on the glaive and waits
for you to release it He walks over and hands it
to Ophelia She grasps it and  Its got
some heft to it She takes it and looks it over
Very well You are absolutely certain there are
no signs left behind to trace it No one saw you
No one followed you
 I know of the one that did yes
 Make a persuasion check with advantage She
wants to believe you but is
 Her yellow eyes darken into slits as she
inspects you For that brief pregnant pause in
conversation you feel this probing stare You
cannot see where the pupils glance but you feel
like you are being looked up and down and then
every aspect of your facial expressions and
mannerisms being instantaneously processed She
leans back comfortably in her stance now
previously with an intense force of
confrontational energy she now seems to relax
takes the glaive and hands it off to one of her
guards and says Please prepare that for mounting
within my collection
 Right Very well Leave it with them
please The guard that was taking it off turns
around and brings it back and hands it to you
 Consider it a favor Remember it please
Very well I am indeed impressed and intrigued
Zemas she shouts off down one of the hallways
and you see a servant rush around the corner
Yes Prepare two carriages and a package for
entry to the Empire We shall be gone for a couple
of weeks to secure business with a contact of
mine Notify Anselm of my absence please We
leave at dusk Of course my lady and he
rushes off Are you ready to leave at dusk
 I was under the impression based on my
contacts with The Gentleman that we were to
return together
 Very well
 How many Ive only called two carriages

one for myself and one for you Do you require more
 So a third carriage It becomes a bit
conspicuous in travel
 Very well Two carriages same as said
before I will prepare collect my things I
suggest you do the same We leave soon I am
excited to travel alongside you She smiles
turns and begins to ascend the steps
 Which right now based on how early in the
afternoon it is gives you roughly about two and a
half three hours before dusk hits
 Is there anything you guys wish to do or
prepare while youre waiting for her to join you
outside of the estate
 Anybody
 Comparably This is the northern side of the
Clover Plaza a little bit to the northwest
Imagine this is like the sparse gated community
of the lawless city The northern side of the
street is where most of the houses live the
various feuding factions Its where the money
goes Right around the road especially south of
it and east of it is where you start getting into
the slums and the folks that exist here because
they have no other choice
 The guards that are inside the house are not
wearing face protection Theyre wearing hide
armor comprised of multiple thick strips of cured
hide dyed to a dark maroon color There is
definitely a color scheme going on here in the
interior and Ophelias preferred means of wear
The ones outside do have a very simple leather cap
with heavy straps like a Romantype style that
descend past the sides of the chin but thats
about it
 As this is happening you guys are talking
and spending time within the cart
 Which is helping tremendously in the
process
 Shes still unconscious The enchantment
does last for a protracted period of time You do
begin to hear a few pairs of horse hooves coming
up louder behind where the cart is currently set
 You guys can see outside of it because there
is no tarp covering the space
 You turn around and look You dont know if
they can hear you or not but you see two rather
extravagantlooking carriages making their way
towards you You can see this dark wood with gold
detailing on the outsides Each has a curtained
window on the right and the left sets of large
spoked wheels on each side and each one has two
horses affixed to the front There is a driver at
the front of each one
 There is no reaction but you are indeed
mooning them
 Make a stealth check
 This one older fellow his nose has grown
over time to the point where its overpowering the
front of his face and hes got this rough white
hair across his chin where he hasnt shaved in a
bit but hes dressed raggedly though nice If
you imagine one of the ghosts in Haunted Mansion
before it died its how hes dressed and as it
 he hears you laughing and he
looks Hello
 He steps down from it  As you
guys are stepping outside you hear this as well
and you see the two carriages brought up on the
sides of the estate Shortly thereafter Ophelia
comes behind you through the door in the long
colonial coat that you had first met her in
Behind her you see two other guards carrying a
number of packed handbags She points All right
please place them the front one is mine within
there They start loading the bags up into the
carriage up on top of it One of the guys are
lifting the other up and they are passing the bags
along as hes putting it up and theyre strapping
it down with rope across the top of it for travel
until eventually she is escorted outside of the
grounds She looks to you all outside of the
cart those that she can see and she goes
Should anyone ask along our journeys I am Lady
Quinn Denzala of Nogvurot going to see my ailing
mother in Deastok You are my personal guard If
you mess that up well you may have more blood
on your hands so it would behoove you to pay
attention Hmm
 Very good Now let us be off in comfort
She steps up into the carriage and one of the
guards helps her She closes the door behind her
The other carriage doors open and are left open
for whoever would like to travel along with them
 Theres one carriage thats hers and
another carriage
 She does not want to travel with anybody At
least not at the moment
 All right thats Caleb
 Currently just one
 Oh with her
 She has her own carriage
 As you guys are hitching the horses to the
other horses Ophelia leans out of a window and
visitation travel there is no reason to have
additional beasts Do you care for your beasts
Are they sentimental to you
 Cut them loose and whatever you lose I
will happily repurchase for you when we arrive in Zadash
 I appreciate your clarification
 Indeed Closes the curtains on her
window
 You still have two horses on your cart but
there are the two being ridden separately Those
horses begin to wander off finding their way
through the Savalierwood southward
 Well say goodbye to the two of your
choosing Nott
 There you go okay As they wander off you
hear Hyah  the
carriages begin to pick up speed Caduceus youre
driving the cart
 With that it picks up as well and now your
train of two carriages and your cart begin to make
their way southward through Shadycreek Run You
guys begin to curve through the Clover Plaza
where you can see the bustle of the city is
definitely making its way towards the latter half
of the day The sunset is cresting probably in the
next hour or so Keeping watch the ones that are
looking about would be Caduceus youd have a
good view You guys have a view throughout the
illusion so you three
 Sure
 Sure You finish focusing on the spell and
as you release your arcane incantation to sense
the area around you theres nothing about the
cart that appears magical Since youre focusing
on that and you are
 All right I would like you four or you
three and you to go ahead and roll perception
checks please
 The two of you noticing as the cloud covered
skies the snowfall has lightened its not as
heavy as it was in the morning but there is still
a faint soft falling of snowflakes in the air
The now gray and white city with the edges of the
roads mucked with dirty snow and mud being
tracked through from all the foot and cart
traffic You do notice off to the sides near one
of the inns or taverns that you have not had the
opportunity to visit yet within the Clover Plaza
you see a small gathering or meeting that catches
your attention You glance over and you wouldnt
have context Actually none of you have the
context for this The two of you see a small
meeting between two really burlylooking figures
in armor A similar style or at least a
haphazard patchworkstyle of armor and adornments
as some of the others that patrol the streets
keeping an eye out Look like thugs a bit You see
two of them meeting with two figures that are in
heavy cloak and hood Because of your perceptive
abilities you notice that they are of a similar
skin color as Ophelia Their features are very
fine and their lithe bodies vanish within the
heavy cloaks that guide them You do see bits of
armor protruding off the side of one that appear
to be dark and insectlike
 It does As youre watching out you see them
discussing there is a brief transaction in the
shadows of this alleyway and a handshake from the
two cloaked figures and these two others As you
ride by and continue southward
 You pay very close attention as you pass
through the main thoroughfare of the Clover Plaza
They dont seem to notice or pay any mind to your
presence and eventually they are out of sight and
you have no means of keeping tabs on them As you
now head towards the southern side of the Clover
Street heading towards the outskirts of
Shadycreek Run Eventually out of the city
entirely As the buildings begin to give way to
hovels and huts and tents and shacks you begin
to see really where the bulk of those who have
escaped or not allowed entry into the Empire now
reside You see mudcovered folks that are bundled
up for body heat in this cold weather Many that
are outstretching hands in your direction for
handouts and others that get too close to the
outside of Ophelias carriage The cartdriver
grabs a switch off the side and whacks one of them
on the hand and he recoils from it and darts off
and a few others hiss and run off with him
Eventually that gives way to the path that leads
to the Quannah Breach Familiar for those of you
who had traveled here previously you can see the
that make up that mark this mountain range that is
the divide between the northern Grey Wastes and
the descent into the Dwendalian Empire The
Greying Wildlands that you reside in begin to give
way as you see the gate of the Uttolot familys
exit from the region As you approach similar
figures that originally greeted you at dusk when
you had arrived here seem to be stationed there
As they approach the carriage before they can
even raise a word Ophelia leans one arm out the
side and throws a small coin purse in their
direction One of them catches it opens it real
fast and gives a motion The two gates open
before the carriage There you get to see the
familiar sharpened wooden pikes that are adorned
with skulls and pieces of whatever other warnings
they could amass for anybody who attempted to pass
without paying the toll Passing beyond those
gates you curve around the corner and now youre
between the sheared cliffs of the Quannah Breach
where it looks like this mountain was pulled
apart leaving behind this strange snaking maze
of open pathway Smooth on the inside of these
otherwise rough mountains like wind has over
time eroded and driven smooth the interior
through here You can hear the faint winds blowing
through occasionally bursting with loud whistles
and this droning moan sound that seems to be
created by the wind pushing against these weirdly
carved pathways through These drivers have done
this many times and very deftly maneuver through
When it does fork off in different directions
they knowingly take the path that you assume will
bring you to the end of this journey After a bit
of time passing through this strange ravine it
opens up once more to a very large gate You can
see crownsguard there expecting you as you pass
through The crownsguard begin to approach The
carriages stop and Ophelia steps out As she does
so another one of the carriage drivers the one
thats driving your carriage Beau and Caleb
steps off to join her with a small scroll case
She steps up to the captain of this watch From a
distance they begin to have a conversation You
cant hear it Its hushed voices or at least not
loud enough to reach your distance
 Nah thats the old campaign
 All right It gives you about  seconds of
invisibility
 Its until the end of your next turn
 Best use of Channel Divinity in DD history
right there ladies and gentlemen
 As this is happening and youre watching
carefully across the way the scroll case is
opened and a series of papers are handed to the
crownsguard there Then a handful of coin are
passed over by Ophelia to the captain Reads over
the papers hands them back gives a hand motion
to a group of about six or seven crownsguard at
the gate They begin to open it and entry is
given to the Empire In the few days youve been
gone the carriages pick up speed once more and
you reenter the Dwendalian Empire heading
towards the northern side of the Marrow Valley
Welcome back
 Continuing southward through the night
Eventually the carriages pull off to the side for
the evening
  That no one can see
 Ophelia doesnt leave her carriage but
eventually the carts and the two carriages are
circled around a campfire The drivers begin to
cook their own meal and you are allowed to use the
space to make what you wish
 You guys are far beyond the city youre
beyond the Quannah Breach You havent reached the
main road yet You are just south of the breach
maybe by four hours or so Youre still north
north side if you want to
 Yes far north A few days north of that
Like three days north
 All right For the purpose of expediency
you have another day and a half two days worth of
travel The snowfall hasnt come in flurries
thankfully Its just been a gentle continuous
snowfall Chilled as it is the blankets have come
in handy for those riding in the cart as the
carriages themselves help insulate somewhat from
the temperature There comes a point where all of
Where your hair begins to stand on your skin and
this deep leadlike sinking sensation clenches
the bottom of your stomach As youve a short
time ago met up with the Glory Run Road heading
southward You begin to come upon two
familiarlooking mounds hills that flank the
sides of the road
 She responds A quick pit stop if that is
what you require
 Very well The carriage at the front comes
to a slow stop The second carriage comes to a
stop As you all begin to step out of your spaces
the soft white hills and white fields and small
elements of the slushy road immediately catch your
vision There towards the southern side of the
eastern hill you see the single wooden cross
embedded in the somewhat hard cold earth There
not yet removed from the cross whether it be by
luck or superstition there is the white
snowdappled multicolored coat of Mollymauk
Tealeaf
 What did she pull
 You watch as the blade emerges The golden
sheen of the Summers Dance is crooked towards the
tip the previously smooth curvature of it seeming
to have blended with the design of the falchion
Its a strange exaggerated blend of the two
 Its about midday As you look around at the
nearby clouds you glance back towards the cart
and you see stepping out of the cloak of
illusion the leathered conscious figure of
Yasha having shaken herself from the illusory
binds Groggy and confused she steps towards the
rest of you Whats going on
 She takes a few more steps She seems to
have tuned the rest of you out and is focused on
the marker It happened again She walks towards
the grave the crunching of her boots through the
condensed snowfall until eventually she comes to
rest at the very point of where he was interred
Falls to her knees her shoulders slumped forward
her hair dark to white tumbling past the front of
her torso Turned away from you all Just quiet
 Both of you feel her shoulders quaking You
cant tell if its tears anger whatever it is
its emotion You hear a growl The growl gets
louder and louder as she begins to stand up All
of you hear this echoing scream from the depths of
Yashas soul this mournful baleful cry of anger
and anguish shatter the still cold air of this
midday sky The blackened skeletal wings of her
fallen aasimar form force both of your hands to
recoil She looks up to the sky In the distance
you see two or three flashes of blue lightning
from a coalescing storm far to the east Her head
lowers without meeting any of your gaze She puts
her hand forward on the top of the marker steps
around it and begins walking towards the storm
 She puts her hand up Ill find you when
Im ready The wings flicker out
 You finish focusing on the cantrip It feels
like it sufficiently took root although you do
not see any difference as it is a bit beneath the
dirt
 As you all turn around and begin making your
way crunching through the snow outside of her
carriage you see Ophelia Mardun arms crossed
leaning against the outside of it As you
approach she has a curious tilt to her head and
she goes I assume this is where you lost
someone Unfortunate
 Dont I know it Well may whoever they
are may their soul find peace To whatever that
means to them She turns around and gets back up
into the carriage With that you all assemble
back onto your respective carts and places and
Hyah The carts begin to pick up pace once more
and silently you all glance over your shoulder
unable to look away until eventually the hills
break the horizon and youre unable to see the
last standing coat and grave site of Mollymauk
Now heading southward for a few more days
trekking down you find your way towards the
Crispvale Thicket on the Glory Run Road There is
the crossroads which turn westward and then
curving outside of the Crispvale Thicket towards
Hupperdook and the Silberquel Ridge Eventually
after a couple more days you pass by and you can
see in the distance as the night gets dark the
glowing lights and the fireworks of Hupperdooks
evening celebrations Memories calling back to
that wonderfully colored person All the joy they
brought The flowers in their hair and horns
Eventually heading back towards the crossroads
that leads towards Felderwin and Berleben
Following that path about eight days of travel
lead you finally to the visual sight of the
central metropolis of Zadash ahead of you For
whatever a home could be for this motley family
this is it and youve made it By the time you
arrive after an evenings camp you hit the
northern gates outside of Zadash by about one
oclock in the afternoon it would be Ophelia
presents her paperwork to the crownsguard that
guard the exterior gate Without issue youre let
in and back to the familiar cobblestone streets of
the district You can see the TriSpires towering
over the exterior walls that mark that district
Memories of what youve done here and times that
youve first met and made whatever small impact
and strange experiences this city had before
youve returned So Mighty Nein what do you wish
to do
 Caleb would know and Im sure
CritRoleStats too would know I will
guesstimate since the last time I checked in with
them on this and the events you guys have gone
through youre three and a half weeks in Youre
pushing somewhere Im guessing after all that
eight days of travel coming down here a little
bit less than that probably You guys were moving
slow because youre moving carts not on
horseback Youre getting pretty close to the day mark
 All right
 No
 So what do you wish to do Youve returned
to
 Theres a currency tab
 I can say if youd like to there are ways
to transition the money For ease you can say
gold piece value for keeping tabs on it but you
can say that a portion of it is platinum for ease
of travel Though you have a bag of holding its
not a huge issue
 Bag of holding is one of those items where
eventually when you reach a certain level youre
like You know what Lets not worry about all
that copper and silver and gold piece weight with you
 Be glad you rolled at least a  on that
investigation check or you never would have found
a bag of holding
 I know I dont show the notes there
regularly but that is the  plus investigation
 I should be better about being a human
being
 The carriages make their way beelining as
if they know where to go towards The Evening Nip
 That is indeed it
 The carriages eventually find their way
snaking through the sometimes narrow streets of
Zadash until eventually you find your way to the
outskirts of The Evening Nip The carriages stop
I imagine the carts would come to a stop as well
those who are driving them Ophelia steps out and
her drivers hold view on this Ophelia heads
towards and waits at the doorway to The Evening
Nip One of her drivers comes up behind her with
the bags that she had packaged in the carriage
and as you guys step off of them one of the
carriages is then brought around the back to The
Evening Nip She has her arms crossed Well are
you all coming
 Good Follow me She steps inside As you
all step into the dark interior of the tavern the
first thing you see amongst the various empty
tables and booths in this small divey tavern The
familiar smell of stained wood and strong liquors
spilled on floors that have long warped and been
stained with all sorts of drinks and chemicals
You see the gruff dwarven bartender Clive look
back at you His chin chewing something on the
inside of his mouth Ah I was given word you
might show up Most likely not mind you but word
was given Go ahead
 Right right No Ive seen you before
 All right well bring them up
 Ophelia looks like she is trying to recall
something Shes like Its round that way She
follows you in It looks like she is trying to
recall like its been a while since shes been here
 Right I know I remember
 You find the trap door open it and you
begin to descend the tight spiral staircase that
leads into the underchambers of The Gentlemans
lair As you reach the base of it you can hear
the sound of a lazy harp playing inside the
stonecase chamber Across the way you can see
the individual playing the harp is Kara whos
leaned against the bar on a stool Her legs up on
the edge of a table and just a little small
compact harp which she is plucking away at
lazily Looks like she may have been imbibing
early this day The usual suspects fill two of the
tables The same ogre guardian eyeing you all with
both familiarity and general mindless suspicion
 
 The left table appears to be rather crowded
There is a card game afoot The Gentleman is
amongst this group most of the general attendees
of this area the Underworks seem to have been
gathered here Theres seven players at the table
at this point and the others are just watching
from the outskirts and theyre in the middle of a
rather tense hand There is quite a pile of coin
a variety of copper silver and gold all thrown
in a handful of platinum thrown in the mix This
looks like some sort of crescendo as The Gentleman
is there looking at his cards in his hand His
eyes quickly glance up and notice you approach
and he gives an acknowledging nod and he goes
right back to his hand Hes focused on the other
players at the table Behind him you can see
looming Sorah his halfgiant guardian still
standing there over him Her arms crossed and she
just watches as you approach and then looks very
carefully over everyone at the table to make sure
everyones hands are visible At this point
everyones hands are called and one by one each
hand hits the table and then at once you see
this raucous cry and scream of excitement and boos
all at once and The Gentleman throws his cards
down shaking his head as he accepts defeat and
one of his handyman manages to scrape the coins
off the table He goes and reaches over to a bowl
on the table behind him and pulls what looks to be
a fresh strawberry thats been cleaned perfectly
none of the green remaining at the top pops it
into his mouth chews for a second and looks over
to the rest of you As he glances at the direction
and points a finger everyone looks over their
shoulder and notices your approach and they begin
to pick up their cards and it seems like the
gaming session is done with your arrival The
Gentleman looks over and goes My my my
 I would have easily read my opponents had
my eyes not been so blinded by beauty As he
looks towards Ophelia he sits up and she puts her
hand out and he takes the hand and kisses it and
then in one rapid movement grabs her arm stands
up and sweeps her around in his arm and brings
her in for this really passionate kiss Theres a
moment where theyre both just locked in before he
goes  and pulls away and grasps his
lip and you can see theres blood now curling
down She sits there and licks the blood and goes
It has been awhile my azure lover However
business before pleasure He wipes his lip a bit
for a second Well youve upheld your promise
and sent it seems a successful endeavor right
I assume since youve returned with her She
goes They are a very capable team indeed
Consider our debt paid she says to The
Gentleman Now I would like to see their debt
paid as well for they have paid for their
service in blood The Gentleman stands up at his
to hear that He looks amongst you all and looks
over to you and gives a curious look and keeps
glancing about Ah I see what she refers to My
apologies However that is the way of the
entrepreneurial sellsword is it not And He
seems to be making a calculation in his mind for a
moment We are on schedule
 I did and thank you very much Actually
the storehouse is already up and running again so
thank you very much for the notification That
saved us some time as well
 That is a way of explaining it yes
 You watch as the glimmer of confidence in
his eyes sets into this glare for a second and
then he  Ill be fine Well your
contract is fulfilled Ms Mardun and I will take
the week to reestablish our trade line and I
think youve earned every copper He looks over
his shoulder and two of his various goons come
over with a heavy chest  onto the
table It hits with a very mighty strike and the
is filled with gold and platinum coins
 Glancing in its mostly platinum
 He pushes it forward and it comes to about
 platinum pieces and  gold pieces
 Times ten
 The remaining sum for the agreement you had
made was  gold pieces for both jobs being
completed He had paid some in advance and given
you some funds but this is the rest of the agreed upon amount
 He then reaches back into a small belt pouch
that is carefully hidden on the inside of his
belt counts out a few coins and throws them
across the table towards you It looks to be
another  or so platinum
 For your loss and your troubles
 Im nothing if not So you have a new
companion that youve dragged into my sanctum
 Well regardless you have two choices
essence to keep tabs
 Its just a formality We need to protect
our interests as much as yours I hope you
understand Mr Miss Whatever youd like
 Mr Clay
  Curious Tell me what you
need
 You have my word as a gentleman
 All right Cree From around the corner
finishing a meal the darkfurred yelloweyed
tabaxi woman begins to approach pulling a small
satchel pulling open the flap
and taking out a small blade
 Oh How strange
 She pulls one vial out of her satchel
uncorking it As she curls a finger upward the
blood seems to lift in a slow arc out of the
wound and drift dancing through the air and
then into the vial before its filled to about
halfway The blood flow staunches and it
completes the vial to about three quarters She
corks it and puts it back into the satchel
closing it Thank you very much for your
donation
 Interesting point No No undead within 
feet
 You feel a little more comfortable knowing
that
 Cree turns to you and goes I hate to
bother but Im happy to see you return I see
that Lucien is not with you
 Make a deception check
 All right Should you cross paths with him
again tell him that Cree would like to see him
Its been so brief since weve been reunited
 Very well Anyway it is good to see all of
you Welcome back The Gentleman is pleased with
your success Yes Then turns around and shuffles
her way back to where she was sitting
 Yes you may
 Its probably right on the cusp of
Quenpillar because that shift happened with the
Harvest Close festival if I recall Ill
doublecheck after the episode to be sure its
the right answer Youre right on the cusp if not
right now entering to that month
 Ah As youre talking to him his eyes
are locked over to Ophelia I cant say that
rings a bell but I can certainly ask my contacts
if youre looking for information about this
individual What was his name
 Ill look into it Dont worry
 Pleasure is mine Fjord Anything else you
require Otherwise I believe you have some money
to spend
 When is it not Please be my guests
 A round of liquor for all youd like
 They do have milk
 Its not particularly chilled Its thick
and creamy Its your choice whether or not its
your preference based on how you lived most of
your life
 Then the barkeep whos the ragged
middleaged man whos running the bar at the
moment One eye you dont know if its swollen
shut or if hes missing an eye or hes just
wanting to study you very closely with the left
one He leans forward and goes Youre joking right
 Its funny Its a funny joke thats a
really funny joke
 I can tell Its workshopped well
 Whiskey I got you whiskey Puts a couple
shots on the bar fills them up
 Together both tiny goblin Nott with her
rather large comparatively shot glass and very
large Caduceus Clay with a comparatively really
tiny shot glass both in unison slam back
 Bartenders already refilled yours
 He pours another glass of milk and pushes it
forward
 Ever had a Cement Mixer
 Kara Shes at the back waiting Shes
watching you as you approach
 Its apparently all right Most of the
business has made its way eastward Things have
gone back to normal
 Oh most of the troop presence made its way
out towards where the outposts were
 Not that Ive been paying attention to at
least
 Not right now
 Of course Come back and ask tomorrow it
might change but Hey Glad youre well
 The drinks are served around you guys can
take as much time here as youd like to Whatever
youd like to do
 Yeah whatever you want You can do whatever
you want to do The city is yours
 Jester are you nearby
 Cant force the playlist
 Your Hpnotiq Your Malibu
 Its Ionos
 There you go You have to delete that in 
days
 Hes in the bar Hes actually near the
stairs At this point the two drivers have
brought down all the handbags for Ophelia and have
placed them in a pile at the base of it
 Yeah It looks like shes shacking up in the
Underworks for a little bit while they
reestablish this trade route So theyre in a bit
of conversation flirtatiously He seems its
like a subtle Pepe le Pew scenario where hes
definitely laying it on a bit thick and shes
being very dodgy and playful but you know
 You can see it at a distance yeah
 I think it is yeah Its in our own
internal friend contract
 Oh thats fine You know where to find me
if you need anything as well
 All right Well if theres anything you
require from me let me know
 Cant say I do
 No
 Hes already talking to Ophelia He isnt
paying attention Hes now having various members
of his troupe pick up her bags for her and move
her into one of the other chambers
 Make an insight check
 At this distance you cant even see his
face unfortunately so its hard Youre seeing
body movement a little bit but his gestures seem
to be in line with classic Gentleman
 You guys stumble your way out of The Evening
Nip back into the streets of Zadash to find your
fortune to enjoy the fruits of your labor and
the best way you can maintain the memory of a man
who lived life to its fullest A man a woman a
they to the fullest
 Fireworks are going off in the center of the
street 
 Some horses freak out and some carts get
dragged down at a fast pace down the road
 A confusing display follows you
 Heading towards the Pentamarket Thats
where well pick up next week
 Well pick up on that next Thursday You
guys will have some downtime Well have a couple
weeks of game downtime for your characters if
theres anything you want to accomplish
 Think about it over the next week and the
beginning of the next episode well discuss what
it is you want to accomplish and we might have a
few momentary role play moments depending on what
it is you want to do That involves contacts
purchases research looking for information
anything you want to do specific to your
character Start thinking about that throughout the week
 Thats  platinum and four gold
 If I didnt have a 
am call time in Santa
Monica tomorrow I would be totally down for it
 Yes No Im good Anyway thank you guys
Laura and Travis welcome back So happy to have
you Ashley we love you Happy birthday Well
have you back as soon as we can get you We love
you And we love you all you guys coming and
hanging out with us tonight for our silly
adventure Once again it was wonderful to meet
everybody at Gen Con Thank you for joining us
there thank you for joining us for the live show
thank you for joining us tonight and is it
Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back Well done Laura Welcome
back Last we left off our band of adventurers
The Mighty Nein having trekked away from Zadash
northward on two different jobs for The Gentleman
had accomplished both of these contracted jobs for
him Losing a friend gaining a friend made their
way back south Oh my god Motherfucker

 You know that part in the game where you
dont understand why you got so many points into
renegade as opposed to paragon

 Im not going to be able to run the game
tonight I cant focus Take two
 Oh I will never live that down Its great
when youre a new actor in LA and everyone says
Yeah you got to get some head shots and I know
all about it You got to get those costume and
character shots in
 Yeah you need some archetypes Come with a
doctor outfit come with a regular business suit
 Ive done a lot of doctors No all that
photo has done is this That is literally the most
its ever done
 That would have been about ten years ago
 Yes Well go with that one Anyway back to
the story at hand Upon completing your journey
checking in with The Gentleman you were paid the
ripe sum that you had discussed After taking your
newfound friend from Shadycreek Run Ophelia back
to The Evening Nip you exited with your new gold
and platinum in hand After a celebratory drink to
the memory of Molly you grabbed Caduceus and led
him into the city of Zadash the largest city
youve ever seen by leaps and bounds to see what
kind of ways you can corrupt this new fresh mind
free out of the Savalierwood
 That is where we left off In this case
guys we have roughly two weeks of downtime Im
going to go around and ask what you would like to
accomplish and if moments require rolls moments
require roleplay anything like that well jump
into it I would like to say who wants to go first
 Okay I will say you could purchase all of
those things and youre buying these yourself
 Okay yeah Id say you could buy all of
those things with lets say a single gold
because your charisma isnt that high A single
gold piece for all of that Thats priced up a bit
 Yep I have that
 No that was on the way out of Hupperdook
They werent there for that
 Well first off do you have or own
tinkerers tools
 This next expense will be  gold pieces for
the set of tinkerers tools
 I would need you to make a tinkering check
to see if you can successfully disassemble the gun
 Without ruining elements of it
 Youre not proficient in tinkerers tools
so its basically a straight intelligence check
Add your intelligence modifier to see if you can
figure out the safest way to do so
 It takes you a little bit of time but you
manage to very carefully disassemble the entirety
of the pistol without any issues
 Through the words of the man responsible for
inventing these things naught but plus years
beforehand if you would like to explain
 Make a tinker check
 Id say itll cost you an additional  gold
in materials because you fail multiple times
going through and end up wasting a lot of
materials until eventually you get it right and
youre certain that this would be the one that
would function properly So you have one explosive
arrow Youre not entirely certain what it does
 Yeah theyre separate individual pieces
 You can certainly try
 You reassemble it It looks to be
functional
 For show or comfort
  All right so you have this
commissioned
 Because it is a commission and it is
specific itd probably be at the similar store
to where Beau got her reversible cloak made earlier
in the campaign It would only take maybe two days
to get the materials together to match the color
you wanted and then the embroidery and finishing
the gloves for your size specifically Since youd
be a smaller frame All in all Id say five gold
pieces Which is pricey for a set of custom
gloves but not based on the money you had made
 Okay so mark that off
 Soltryce
 Thats a good way to remember it
 Okay Two things One I would like you to
roll for your forgery
 Are you proficient with your forgery kit
 I think you should depending on your
 Yeah Go ahead and roll a d Add your
intelligence modifier and your proficiency bonus
 Actually no Lets make it dexterity
 Proficiency bonus and your intelligence
modifier Dex Im sorry
 You manage to forge the letter in what you
believe to be a fairly decent forgery
 Youre not matching somebodys handwriting
per se Its more about getting an officious look
to it with little flourishes of calligraphy at
the beginning of sentences
 Exactly I would like you to roll a general
dexterity check for me
 Okay Theres a difference between sealing
wax and candle wax How do I know this Because
Ive made that mistake before sealing letters for
previous DD campaigns You manage to press your
ring into the wax and pull back and now theres
mush on the end of your ring and theres a
circular piece of mushed soft wax where the seal
should be
 Sealing wax its not too expensive Well
say two silver to get you a chunk
 There you go You finish the letter You
seal it best to your ability You hope it seems
official enough and you send it off towards its
destination in Rexxentrum
 End scene all right Is that the extent of
the things you want to accomplish Nott
 Okay All righty who wants to step up
next
 Thats true so Caleb
 So the four of you Jester Caduceus Caleb
and Beauregard are going shopping
 Okay all right Well what are you guys
looking for
 Okay Midday you make your way to the
Pentamarket to the very vibrant center area of the
marketplace there Theres a number of
intersecting pathways that help divide between all
the various carts and tents that open up At this
point Id say its maybe late morning or so A
lot of the curled up curtains in the front are
being affixed to the top or have been for a while
The smells of fresh baked goods cooking stews
and various other treats and snacks that are being
presented as part of the shopping experience catch
your nostrils as you move through You hear music
playing in the distance For all the chaos that
life has thrown you in the past  days it feels
nice to step into a place thats so filled with
life and lack of understanding of how dark the
world is at the fringes of this empire both with
the war going on and some of the things youve
encountered Its nice to step into this space and
you catch yourself instinctually smiling and
finding it infectious to brighten your mood You
turn to see the darkened green wood with gold
accoutrements that marks the exterior of The
Invulnerable Vagrant The front door is closed
but appears to be not locked for any particular
reason
 Now that weve physically built it yeah
Its a little larger inworld than the one that we did
 But the aesthetic is there yeah As you
step forward the door opens up and leads you
inside and there the same warmly lit interior
with the glowing chandelier above greets you
Across the way sitting behind the desk face down
in a book one of the various Pumats who looks up
and Oh why hello there Yeah oh its been a
while Sorry took me a second to recognize
you Youre very silhouetted by the bright
sunshine outside you right now and its a bit dark
interior so come on up
 Another Pumat comes around the corner and
goes Oh do we have folks in here Yeah dont
worry Pumat I got them taken care of Oh
theres even more coming in
 Caduceus Why its a pleasure to meet you
as well
 Dont see many of our kind wandering around
these large establishments
 Well its ours Well its his Hey
Prime You might want to step out of the workshop
for a second You hear some rustling and
grumbling in the background and the curtain opens
and you see a third one of them step out goggles
affixed to the head a little bit of smudges of
dirt on the edges of the chin What are you
talking about Oh my goodness
 Where are you from To be perfectly honest
we havent really run into any other firbolgs
really since we came here
 Wow
 Well thank you At this point the fourth
one comes down from a ladder off on the right side
chamber Oh is the order getting Oh its a
whole party over here Is that another firbolg
Comes down and the others like Yeah theres
one over here The other Pumats like Im
impressed I like the color tones Its a great
arrangement visual perspective
 The one with the goggles in the back goes
Sorry about that I should clarify These three
are arcanebased copies of myself We are all
collectively Pumat but I am the original
 One of the other ones speaks up and goes
We absolutely take no offense because its true
 The three simulacrum all go Aww at the
same time
 Well I greatly appreciate that We put a
lot of hard work into it and its hard to come
across folks like us that would appreciate
something on this scale
 Well unless I am mistaken from my
previous memory of times outside of Zadash whens
the last time you had a good bath
 This one knows what hes talking about
Listen to him Follow that around
 Oh sorry Did you come here to do
business
 Prime goes All right then Nice to meet
you
 Caduceus Clay Pumat Sol Pleasure
 Of course you got gold weve got things
to purchase Anyway other Pumats take care of
these folks Ive got to get back to work Good to
see you all again
 He exits to the back room The two other
Pumats step back and watch and theyre both
looking at you with this kind of
 Not too bad People say you want to be your
own boss well

 Unfortunately we dont really sell much in
the realm of food items
 We do actually To be perfectly honest
you mostly cleaned us out last time you were in
here but weve got a few more items in here
 We got the bracers here if thats what
youre looking for
 No
 Yeah
 And six weeks later youre coming in and
asking about them still
 But yeah price is still  gold
pieces
 These bracers enchanted by our fantastic
boss Pumat Sol allow the bearer as long as
theyre not wearing any physical armor to impede
the enchantment andor a shield on their body
helps protect them by deflecting incoming blows
and giving them a better sense of avoiding
physical atrocity onto their person
 How about we meet in the middle and we
stick with the price provided
 All right well put this here waiting for
you right there
 Yeah You can look at it but you dont
own it
 That can be considered depending on how
much of a purchase youre looking to make What
are you looking for
 Dont think Ive forgotten that silly
string
 If thats the case if you dont mind
waiting Pumat III could you go to our storage
facility and get some more of that wizard paper
and ink It looks like hes buying out our stock
here at the moment Yeah not a worry Ill be
back here in the better part of  or  minutes
if you dont mind being patient That one Pumat
takes a little cloak and throws it over his
shoulders See you guys in a little bit And
exits outside
 Theres three in the room left behind One
of them had drifted off to the side for a bit but
seems to be still listening in So you still have
the one thats dealing with you
 We dont have a whole lot of incense here
I can probably provide about  gold worth of
incense But there are incense makers within
Zadash that Im sure can probably help you out
with the rest of it
 We can definitely look to ordering more
incense if you foresee this being a consistent
thing We normally dont get that much of a
request for it
 Feel free to ask and Ill go ahead and
he grabs this small wood front wood back with
leather edging binding ledger or catalog that he
pulls out and opens it up Yeah let me know what
youre looking for Ill tell you if we got one in
stock
 Takes a little set of glasses and puts them
on the edge of his nose All right
 Feather Fall We got that sure
 All right theres a few options there For
lower level enchantments we got an Expeditious
Retreat spell Thatll help get you out of the
thick of things
 All right thats putting that down as well
as a possibility Those prices here because
theyre both relatively simple spells so Ill put
them at about  gold apiece Thats  gold
total for those two spells
 Yeah well here Lets see In the realm
of what youre looking to accomplish here
 So youre going directly not messing
around just a straight Catapult
 Its a straight up catapult Catapult
yeah we do have that as well That is  gold
for the batch of three Any more spells youre
inquiring about
 Here Ill show you what weve been able to
accomplish since your absence Weaponwise this
wasnt enchanted more than it was something that
came into our purview from somebody that was
looking hard for some cash and we offered them a
bit of an exchange as it was promising and
intriguing He pulls out this longsword but
beyond the hilt the blade is snapped and gone
Its a broken longsword Its got a silver hilt
and a silver pommel wrapped in red leathers around
the handle and there is a very fine filigree
across the hilt and around the base this silver
loop on the bottom of the pommel But its a
broken sword
 Youve got about an inch of blade there and
it looks like its still sharp in places If you
get real close you can probably make someone have
a really bad day
 Well looking it over it looks like there
was some sort of enchantment embedded in it but
since the blade has been broken theres not it
looks to be very old Looks like it probably was a
relic from pre He goes and looks at his notes
real fast Yeah this would be preDivergence
from the Age of Arcanum The reason we took it is
the historical significance We could probably
fetch a pretty penny should we take it to the
various lyceums The Academy would probably be
real interested But if you want to take it off
for sentimental value or go get it repaired some
time its  gold
 Prime finished up some of this dust here
and he pulls out a small sack that looks to be a
redbrown dust He says Hes proud of this one
Im going to be real honest with you If its
sprinkled over any edible substance it greatly
improves the flavor To the point where its
downright distracting Its the Dust of
Deliciousness
 Last thing weve got here and then were
pretty much out at the moment You guys have
become our number one customers which is really
appreciated Just finished this cloak last week
here He steps around the edge and you can see
while as well decorated as the place is its
pretty bare now You guys have come through and
grabbed the necessary bits and what else was in
there has been picked up as well You guys arent
the only people who shop here but youve been the
most recent intense customers He pulls this fine
bluish purpletint cloak material that as it
flows as he lifts it up from behind the small
locked box it ever so faintly gives off this
shimmer This is designed to obfuscate the
movements of the person who wears it to where it
makes him a little more difficult to pay
attention The enchantments here and he looks
back and you can see it right along the hood of
it theres these faint little runes He goes
This is some these are Sylvan I dont know if
any of you read more the classics
 Well there you go This is specifically a
cloak with an elven enchantment designed to help
make things difficult to see So theres that one
as well
 Thats all we got
 Yeah an answer
 Unfortunately enchanted weaponry is a very
specialized
 Oh Im sorry about that If you want to
commission an axe we can start working on
enchanting one for you
 Well it depends on what sort of
enchantment youre looking for If you just
 Okay
 The other Pumat is now looking over from the
other room and going like Hes like Well have
to talk to Prime about that Prime Comes out
Yeah Hes like She wants to see if you could
enchant an axe that hits really hard and is
really cool and wounds dont close and
 You watch as Pumat Prime is actually in his
head doing math I could probably manage
something like that I got about an eightmonth
window for completion and it would probably run
you about between ten to twelve thousand gold
 Oh I can guarantee it Wont find anything
better than that for a specified number of
enchantments this side of Rexxentrum
 So you want a weapon that when it hits
somebody they start dancing
 All right So the only enchantment youre
requiring is the possible ability of making
something dance uncontrollably
 All right
 Welcome back man
 There we go Thats going to be Its
doable Its pricey That one will put you about
 gold
 Sorry If you want just something thats
pretty sharp and helps you hit a little better I
could do that for much cheaper
 Lets see That one will put you back
about Id say maybe  gold
 Could finish that in about four or five
days yeah
 All righty just provide the weapon and
well get that taken care of for you
 Okay What kind of axe is it
 Handaxe Okay so it can be thrown as well
 All right Well go ahead and well get
right on that for you not a worry
 So thatd be  gold for that
 Put that in the pot right there since
youre looking for possibly other purchases
Thats  gold pieces What else you looking to
buy
 Yeah
 All right so thats
 Make a persuasion check with advantage
since everybodys helping you
 You see the Pumats talking to you kind of
Let me go ahead and have a conversation with the
boss man Hold on just a second Turns around the
corner You hear some hushed voices Yeah fine
sure He comes back out All right we got
ourselves an approval for a discount there Well
be happy to knock about a hundred gold off that
total price for you if thats amenable to you
 All right so whos buying what
 Sword and the cloak
 All righty Well here
 Well here Ill do a total price here and
then you guys can
 Its  for getting your handaxe
enchanted
 Well Im doing a total amount here first
dont You guys can decide how to divvy it up for you
 So thats  for the cloak Thats 
for the bracers Thats  for the handle No dust
 And then you got a and then  for the
spells
 Hold on a second there So its  worth
of spells and you said  worth of paper and
ink right At this time you guys have been
discussing the other Pumat comes back with his
cloak with a big old crate in his hand and goes
Got the rest of the paper and ink Hold on Sets
it down
 Then that is  gold for your incense
 All right Are you guys all marking off
your amounts
 Based on how many pieces youve thrown at
me its probably better to have you all just
deduct what youve spent individually I was going
to try that but then
 That got a little chaotic there
 All righty so theres your sword theres
your bracers theres your cloak
 Six servings of dust in this
 All right Well there you go Go ahead and
mark off that amount there as well When all is
said and done when youve marked off your
amounts heres a hundred gold back You may
redistribute it as you see fit
 Well that was what you haggled them down
 It just makes it easier than adding
 Make a persuasion check
 Well only because you asked so nice but
dont tell the boss
 All right
 So Ill see you back here in about five
days or so there Jester and we should have a
fresh new enchanted handaxe there for you
 All righty Well its been a pleasure
 Oh its He pulls it up again Its
that Taryon fellow or whatever But Im most of
the way through it Kind of a slow reader
 Yeah weve been kind of passing it around
as we each finish it
 Ill ask him Really appreciate the
suggestion
 Most of the weight is the materials that
contain the paper The paper isnt very heavy but
because it is specifically designed and made for
the uses of inscribing and enchantment and other
things it is contained in very very careful
protective wooden boxes Theyre all stacked
repeatedly within this crate
 Hey Caduceus Pleasure to meet you
 Well hope so Brightened up the room
 Aww youre too kind
 Yeah theres Grace of the Wilds which is
in the Pentamarket district You find it You in
particular you find it very quickly because
youre attuned to the smell of some of the herbs
and various mosses that theyre been cultivating
and drying out there Youre like 
Thats familiar  Yeah And so much like
Toucan Sam you follow your nose
 to Grace of the Wilds and there you see a
female woman s with kind of wild big black
curly hair whos just sitting there Nobody else
is paying mind to the front little tent that she
has set up that is attached to what appears to
be the rest of her shop which is mostly
closedoff and dark As you approach she glances
over and goes Hah Hi Can I help you What do
you need what do you need What can I do
 No Im Jesna Bree But this is Grace of
the Wilds this is my shop But welcome Welcome
Welcome welcome
 For training You want to train
 Of course of course Just give me your
list Id like to see
 I know I figured Oh Ah Okay yeah And
as shes talking to you you watch as her other
hand takes a piece of chalk and is writing on the
wall behind her Id be more than happy to help
and I can help A lot of things I can help you
with too and Im happy to And then in kind of
crappy handwriting underneath all the various
prices of the herbs and things that are provided
you now see training Shes added it to her list
of things that she does as talking to you
 Oh Oh yes Oh yes Oh yes I can help
with the tea The tea I can help
with So training What do you want to train in
Please tell me
 Okay okay Okay that can be done It may
take some time Little bit of time Give me your
time well make it work
 The herbalism kit for this is Its five
you already have one
 Yeah you would be purchasing proficiencies
the training is what you would be doing This
would be the bulk of your downtime because it
will take a while for you to really get
 But the full training for this will come to
about Ill say  gold
 And you are now proficient in the herbalism
kit
 Oh I misunderstood Oh
 Ive got you Well if thats the case
buying the materials Youre essentially buying
them at halfprice You can make healing potions
but you get to make them at  gold apiece as
opposed to 
 Okay yeah Cooking spices will run you a
gold for the full set
 You can find a whole bevy of beverages all
throughout the Pentamarket
 Okay So at  gold  thats six
healing potions that you have the materials to
make But you can spend your downtime during this
week to make a few if youd like
 Thatll put you at about one potion per day
of creation So you can easily take this time to
make all six
 Theyre baseline healing potions level one
but you should be able to do so Cool And you
made a friend with Jasna Bree
 Shes a little sad that she doesnt get a
chance to teach you or train you but shes like
Thats okay next time Next time Whenever you
feel like it you come on by Ill teach you No
worries
 A tea kettle you can get
 Id say you manage to acquire the cooking
supplies the kettle some fine teas that you can
acquire and altogether Id say
 Id say that would put you back about with
the hat Four gold
 You werent asking for anything too crazy
 All right So for that Lets see here
 Make an investigation check
 Well if youre both looking for it you can
aid or help So advantage on that
  Asking around most folks Well
diamonds as a rough raw material is hard to find
Usually theyre already embedded in jewelry and
most jewelers are out there Eventually somebody
points you to a place like  If
anyone will have it its probably over at Suvos Secrets
 Suvos Secrets And they point you over to
this large gray shop tent that has an ominous
feel when you look at it As bright a day as it
is its like the Addams Family house in the
Pentamarket It looks it looks unwelcome
 Yeah its a very drab very coarse material
that the tent is made out of Outside it looks
like the ropes that are affixing it down are
rotted a bit and you can see that some of the
ropes are starting to pull and tear on the edges
It looks closed Except for theres where the
flaps come together in the middle It doesnt look
like anything that you should buy from
 All right As you enter Suvos Secrets
 Youre hitting the tent front Youre
not walking in
 Yeah its open Its an entrance You go
inside and the interior Its maybe  feet by 
feet its not a very large interior space And it
looks like there are some tables set up on the far
ends perimeter to the outside of it And on the
back there is a very very large custom rocking
chair that is just like  And sitting
in it you see an older very intenselooking
female dragonborn bronzescaled but in the age
theyre starting to turn a bit green at the edges
kind of patinaed a little She sits there in the
rocking chair hands kind of crossed on the chest
just rocking and looking at you as you enter
 Thank you very much Welcome to Suvos
Secrets
 Yes Who are you
 Jester What are you looking for that I
might be helping you with
 She leans forward and her hands hit the
front of her knees Leaning back she looks very
small but once she steps into the little bit of
light thats coming through the front of the tent
Suvos a fairly large dragonborn and even just
leaning forward sitting is almost as tall as you
are Jester
 Diamonds you say
 How many diamonds are you looking for
 Maybe 
 She reaches back and theres this large It
looks just like a sack Just a general sack and
she reaches and grabs the edge and scoots it over
without breaking eye contact It scrapes across
the ground and you hear things clattering around
inside like shes carrying a large pouch of
various pots and pans She reaches in still
looking at you One
 Two And eventually counts out 
varyingsized diamonds They all look Some are
cut it looks like one of them is a little rough
and just hasnt been cut by a jeweler yet But
sure enough theyre
 Make a perception check
 You have Youve seen some fine jewelry
especially from your mothers chests
  Its the tassels

  Its sharp and
dangerous
 Yeah we are
 Exactly
 These are all legitimate diamonds with
varying degrees of worth But looking at the
batch theres probably about  Well say
rounded off about Roughly  gold worth of
diamonds of the group that she set
 That is all right They will still be here
when you come back
 Drops them into the satchel pushes it away

 So you each have  gold worth of diamonds on
you
 There are many things
 Grabs and pulls the sack back over
 Yeah The tables are all empty
 There is just a sack where she keeps all of
the goods
 Reaches in and pulls out what looks to be a
mummified creatures hand You cant Its not
quite humanoid its got fur on it Sets it down
This is a treated owlbear matron hand
  gold Its a good keepsake
 Reaches in pulls out a big batch of garlic
Just a big old batch of garlic in a small netted
sack She goes Garlic Good for cooking and also
for keeping away vampyr

 Make a religion check Jester
 This plan sounds perfectly sound

 So for the sake of brevity
 Its a whole slew of strange knickknacks
 Yeah it takes the better part of  or 
minutes or so Theres an iron mask Where the
mouth should be its just these two metal tusks
that stick out almost like a castiron orc mask
 Oh my god There are Theres half of a
chess set carved from jade When I say half I
side so its completely useless There is a
single vial that has a familiar red medicinal
liquid in it It looks like there is a healing
potion should you be so inclined to purchase it
And the rest of it is just absolute junk
 Very well Two gold Which is really
expensive for fucking garlic
 Make a persuasion check
 It is yours
 Its so overpriced for garlic
 It is actually pretty artisanal garlic
 All right so yeah This would be a greater
healing potion
 No For this shes like This will run 
gold pieces But it will keep you from dying in
places where you will probably most likely be
dying
 Pulls it back and puts it back in the
satchel Then you will not have it
  She seems to nod like Well
done
 No mask
 Five gold
 Make a persuasion check
 Five gold
 Be careful They say the curse lasts for
whoever I dont remember the rest of it Its
just a mask theres no enchantment Its just a
very scary mask But congratulations its yours
 Its all bullshit Well most of its
bullshit from this individual
 Very well Is that the end of it
 Be safe and come back again I am very
interested to sell to you what else might come my way
 You step out The bright light of the midday
sun The clouds of the previous storm have parted
a bit and theres actually bright light and your
eyes have to adjust Youre like Aah Ah Ah
 All right Who else Weve done a few things
with you guys Weve done Notts stuff Fjord
anything you want to do
 Sailors not so much The Empire is
landlocked aside from the very far north and
those waters are in the frigid depths Its a lot
of ice floes and treacherous water up there So
there is very little passage up north The
Menagerie Coast as you know is where all of the
port towns are and thats the relationship
between the Empire and The Menagerie Coast That
agreement is based on the fact that essentially
the Menagerie Coast holds all the longterm
imports and exports in the palm of their hand
 That would be Nicodranas Nicodranas from
Zadash its a little over a week to get there
Id say
 Okay Make three successive investigation
checks for me please
 You make it as far south as Trostenwald
before the frustration wells up inside you Its
been a series of dead ends Youve asked around
and listened and anyone who wouldve crossed
paths with some of the shipping lanes that youre
familiar with and that Sabian was familiar with
none of them are passing this far north You
assume that to continue this you would have to go
to the Menagerie Coast and that would involve a
thorough passage through Nicodranas and the
various wharf taverns and seeing what old
connections you might be able to dredge up in that
time but thats going to take you a little
while
 By the end of the week youll get not quite
to Nicodranas If you want to you can traverse
the Wuyun Gorge pass through the Wuyun Gates and
head into the Menagerie Coast You will be alone
and it isnt a notdangerous road So just be
aware There are some possibilities
 You sure
 Okay After this unfortunately notfruitful
travel south in seeking out any possible word of
Sabian you shift your attention back and decide
to rally with your allies Perhaps thats the
direction you want to go in the future Okay what
else would you like to do
 Okay Very well Anybody else
 All righty Cat Frumpkin has returned
 Okay Well get to that First you guys
make your way to the archive and you enter there
and the following morning Caleb is very 
tiredlooking but also hard to tell
 Making your way into the archive its
fairly bustling in comparison to what you know
Its either dead or theres a handful of people
going through it Today its a handful of people
going through Youre like Oh wow theres four
people in here researching right now
 Within a short time what are you looking
to do Beauregard
 One of the monks goes Let me go inquire
Ill be right back and wanders up the stairs
You see them descend the stairs with another
figure Gray robes with blue lining hood pulled
back and there you see Zeenoth
 He steps down and goes Beauregard I
wasnt aware you had returned
 Hi Dairon unfortunately is still out on
the front lines
 Well shes been sent to assess political
threats beyond the eastern border Been gone for
about  days and is said to return in the next 
before we send anyone after her But Im sure
shes fine
 Well things change when theyre at that
moment of conflict
 No She progressed behind enemy lines and
then wrote to us that she was staying for an
extended period Shes impetuous I think you may
know something about that Anyway Im sorry
Dairon is not here What are you inquiring
about
 Ah Well there is Tubo Tubo is quite an
accomplished monk of the Cobalt Soul and might be
able to help you whereas Dairon could not
 Youve seen Tubo Youve not directly
interacted because Tubo much like Dairon works
on a higher level You hadnt quite garnished the
attention beyond just being that brat for a
while Tubo is this very darkskinned halfling
with very short widows peaktype hair and this
very calm smile about him Very wellrespected
but you havent really seen him move or do
anything other than walking through the archive
and be present
 You dont know
 All right I shall return Good seeing you
again
 Zeenoths patient smile fades as he turns
Within a short time you see coming from down the
same staircase Tubo his arms folded in front of
him as he descends and turns toward you So you
are Beauregard correct
 And youre looking for training while your
expositor is away correct
 Follow me
 Zeenoth whos a little bit behind goes
Ill accompany him in his reading if thats all right
 Weve met in Trostenwald
 Hello Please lead the way to where youd
wish to read
 All right Tubo brings you to a chamber you
havent been in in a while which is the formal
training grounds beneath the archive There is a
set of double doors in the far end that blend in
mostly with the dark wood that a lot of the bookcases
are crafted out of It leads you down a set of
stairs into what is essentially a training pit
with very heavily packed sand and dirt and there
are a number of wooden poles that emerge from
beneath that have all sorts of skewed extensions
This is where a lot of forms are practiced and a
lot of defensive maneuvers are utilized You were
brought through in this area for training in waves
time and again but its been a while since youve
been down here since youve been abroad and
theres no other people there training currently
Tubo brings you down Very well Show me what
youve got For the sake of brevity
 Yes Roll up a new character Tubo splatters
you across the wall You spar for a bit showing
him the limits of your capabilities and hes
deftly with a smile on his face dodging
parrying You get a few good hits in and he backs
away Very good and then begins to overwhelm
you with his assault but never enough to inflict
pain just enough to throw you off your guard
until a moment he turns around and puts his hands
up into a cross once more and goes Four days I
need four days with you
 And then your training for now is
complete
 Day one begins Time to read
 He takes you back upstairs and begins to
collect books and throw them into a pile and sits
you down
 You begin reading and its getting
frustrated but as youre reading Tubo begins to
lean in and say As youre reading think
carefully about what youre trying to find What
youre trying to learn
 What are you looking to research
 For the portion of this day Tubo begins to
instruct you on how to not just read and research
but in focusing your spiritual energy on the
specific things youre searching you begin to
find quick ways to Johnny  through tomes to find
what youre looking for With this comes your
ability to spend a ki point to gain advantage on
an investigation check
 Day two comes around and he brings you down
to the subterranean chamber for more training
This time he begins to show you how to use that
same internal spiritual energy or ki at the
moment of impact to give off this very localized
wave of spiritual energy He begins to tell you
how This can break through defenses of things
that are meant to not be touched with a mortal
hand This is intended as a way to bypass
sometimes the mundane protections Through this
training he teaches you how use your empowered
strikes where now your physical fists and attacks
as a monk are considered magical
 Yes you can now punch ghosts
 Day three he brings you down to the chamber
with a chair and says Sit
 Tell me Tell me a secret
 Kind of Do you want to tell me a secret
 No
 He looks frustrated turns around does a
little loop comes back and as youre about to
speak up again he does a series of quick hits
that hurt a little but that catch you right in
the clavicle the side of throat and then right
under the chin As you pull back make a saving
throw for me please This would be a charisma
saving throw I believe
 He begins to ask you questions about your
youth and your family history things you dont
normally talk about with anybody Outside of
stopping yourself from speaking at all youre on
the verge of constantly giving up the information
He teaches you This is a technique that allows
you to pull the truth from those that would not be
so forthcoming It is situationally very useful
and I will show this to you And so he teaches
you the Extort Truth ability On the fourth and final
day he leads you down and begins to show you how
to use your ki capabilities your spiritual
energy to blend it with moments of adrenaline
bursts to give yourself a moment of reactionary
time where previously you would have expended any
capability of preparing yourself for an assault
As he puts you through hours of this rigorous
training he goes Very well The time to show
what you can do has come Claps You watch as two
other monks come down  But they have bows
and arrows and they have a third one they hand to
him They all nock the arrows and aim them right
at you
 Yeah Tubo goes Fire All three arrows
come toward you Thats a  to hit
 Okay Thats another  actually And that
is a  So all three hit you
 The first arrow is ten points of damage
 Yes you can
 Ten
 You catch one arrow
 Correct
 Okay You take one point of damage You just
barely catch it It manages to nick the side of
your shoulder
 The two other arrows are coming at you as
well
 Okay you can do that now if you have
another reaction
 You dont have to spend a ki point to reduce
the damage You spend a ki point to throw it back
 You spend the same ki point Roll for damage
reduction on the next one Thats  points of
damage
 You catch both arrows The third one is
coming towards you
 Spend another ki point Thats two ki points
now You get to roll to reduce the third one
 Yeah that one does no damage You catch one
arrow out of the air It just barely nicks your
shoulder The other one you catch just as it
scrapes past the side of your arm The third one
you catch in the middle of the air with no impact
In the blink of an eye youve deflected all three
arrows shot at the same time
 I did And with that your training is
complete
 No He hands the shortbow to the other one
and they all head back upstairs
 Impressive Dairon was not wrong about
you
 That you are an apt pupil Now our time is
done I have things to do And four days with you
has been more than enough
 He makes his way back up and escorts you out
of the training chamber
 So during this time Caleb
 Make an investigation check with advantage
to find all the right information
 So on that specific thing you learn about
the Kryn Dynasty which is the Xhorhasian society
that exists in the ruins of Ghor Dranas You know
that most of them were drow dark elf from what
youve heard and the ones youve interacted with
Now the drow were brethren alongside all elves in
the past history until their minds were corrupted
and swayed by the terrible silver tongue of Lolth
the Spider Queen one of the Betrayer Gods Under
her will they became deceptive cruel and
violent When the Betrayer Gods were defeated and
banished during the Calamity and the Divergence
that separated the mortal realm from the gods that
once threatened to destroy it entirely the drow
returned to their subterranean cities to rebuild
their power far from the burning light of day
Much of the recent studies into current drow
society across Exandria speak of growing paranoia
and madness thats seeping in with the believed
influence of Tharizdun the Chained Oblivion
Whether it be by proximity of remnants of his
power deep beneath the surface that have grown
close to these societies but there is whispers
and research that say that some of these dark elf
societies are being driven slowly mad by this
influence Strangely what studies youve been
able to find that talk about penetrating the Kryn
Dynastys intense boundaries I fucking looked at
you immediately Laura because I knew where it
was going
 Of course As soon as I read the word I was
like Without fail
 We missed you But for those who were able
to move past the boundaries to research more of
what little is known of the Kryn Dynasty there is
little in iconography under Lolth or Tharizdun
And what remains of that is ancient and crumbling
and largely ignored by the society
 Theres nothing about beacons nothing about
reincarnation However it does speak of the
dynasty worshiping something other something that
is new and dangerous as far as the Cobalt Soul is
concerned with what little research they have
They refer to it as The Luxon and seek to bring
all under its burning banner Theyve rallied to
the surface of Ghor Dranas casting the skies in
eternal midnight that spreads with their dominion
Theyve begun taking the ravenous hordes of
beastmen and terrors of the Xhorhasian wastes
and indoctrinate them under this new false god
You also learn that a number of people mostly
children of adolescent age have been found
abducted in the night by the Kryn on occasion
though the number has steeply grown this past
generation years after the first open conflicts
with the Kryn began The last thing you discover
is the leader of the dynasty is known as Empress
Leylas Kryn She is called an umavi by them
though the words meaning is unknown by current
research Accounts of the Empress speak of her as
a powerful and dangerous warrior on the
battlefield And well over  years old or more
as records date back that far since she arrived in
local history Thats what youve discovered about
the Kryn Dynasty and Xhorhas
 Make an investigation check
 The things you discover from whats
constant the motion moving forward unyielding
Some powerful arcane influences can accelerate or
slow the rate at which time passes locally even
stop it There are some stories from the Age of
Arcanum that speak of the greatest of sages
experimenting with reversing the forward momentum
of time and supposedly with some success But the
process apparently was so taxing and the energies
required so extensive that it nearly killed those
who passed through this natural flow Thats as
much as you can pick up on the specific research
involving that shift of time Theyre more
footnotes and like a We dont mess with that
because those who tried have mostly been
disintegrated or destroyed in the process
 Yes but they existed close to  years
ago
 The names that were in there are none that
correlate to anything youd recognize
 Ill send you those notes later You do pick
up because of your very high roll there are
apparently some newer arcane experiments regarding
time and reality being fielded within the Soltryce
Academy in Rexxentrum A newer magical energy
seems to have been discovered or rediscovered
that can seemingly adjust such properties with
ease Its being referred to as Dunamis
 But other than that theres very little
information because all that seems to be
proprietary within the Academy
 Okay Fjord what else would you like to
do
 I was like are you sure thats all you want
to do
 The eye where it sits in the hilt and it
only sits on one side its not both sides that
contain the eye because there arent two pupils
There is a singular eye that is embedded in it
that is looking out what would essentially be
towards the left
 No its near the crossguard in the center
of the hilt When you look at it it doesnt seem
to move or shift or pay any attention Practicing
the next few days and trying some things out you
focus some of your arcane gifts towards an object
casting Witch Bolt towards a nearby rock or low
dried and forgotten trunk of a tree At the
moment the incantation begins the eye shifts to
look towards the target of the spell The spell
explodes and you look back at the hilt and its
already reverted back to where it was before
 But it did seem to react to when the spell
was cast
 Sure all right So you make your way to The
Evening Nip By the time youve returned its
been the better part of the twoweek period of
time and you guys are also generally worried the
fact that Fjord just vanished during this time
period
 Big surprise
 
 You make your way to the subterranean
basement of The Evening Nip The Gentleman is not
currently present but upon asking around and you
wait for about  minutes or so he does return
from the storage room to the side where you had
previously been led down and through the
Underworks As he comes in he sees you and sits
on the other side of the table throwing his leg
over one side and sitting at a very comfortable
and casual way across from you Fjord Im being
told that youre looking for me
 I have some reaches in places yes Thats
quite a scope youre requesting I would say its
a good bet that most criminal elements you would
encounter there are not at my network except for
a handful It might be more useful to you to know
the ones to trust
 Okay Port Damali you say
 Really
 The jewel of the coast Ive been a number
of times though its been years since Ive been
able to leave my work here alone So if youre
looking to expand your portfolio beyond Zadash
that is commendable The one contact I could
recommend in Port Damali would be Father Dwondaff Pierce
 Dwarven fellow Scraggly in the face
Dresses well He helms the Pearl Shrine a house
of worship to Avandra the Changebringer Tell him
that you bring many gifts
 Should you not work with Father Pierce and
his network be careful You could easily find
yourself on an opposing side to my business and I
do not take kindly to betrayal
 That I do
 If something comes to mind Ill send it
your way
 And if anything comes to mind that would be
of interest to my ears business or otherwise
please keep me informed
 Of course Then he goes off to get a drink
at the bar As you turn around right there at the
steps is Cree the darkfurred tabaxi She
approaches and goes Im sorry to bother you I
noticed you descend here I have heard since your
last arrival that there were losses in your journey
 I have had a number of uncomfortable dreams
in the week and I cannot sense Lucien
 Make a persuasion check
 They are cold and sad I just see him
alone and Ive tried to focus He is not nearby
I have a very hollow feeling about this
 That was what I was fearing
 That is all right Thank you for your
honesty It is hard for him to be gone for so
long then come back and so swiftly go again
Maybe I had put too much faith
 We of the Task Takers we were undergoing a
ritual that he had orchestrated with an ally of
his a woman of magical renown He said that this
was something that was meant to lead us to this
city he promised a place where we could learn of
a great many powers and secrets We believed him
He was very charismatic in his cruelty at times
But he did not survive
 Two years
 I wasnt expecting to see him this last
time I feel like whatever grace brought him back
to us maybe it was your carelessness that took
him from us again
 It is all right I have started a new life
here and it has been serving me well
 Such are these days Thank you for your
candor She turns around and walks away
 Okay You guys have all gathered up at The
Leaky Tap
 All right what do you want to do
 Roll a wisdom check for me
 Okay Youve spent so much of your life in
the tranquility of the cold and quiet
Savalierwood and even in the most naturebased
portion of the city of Zadash the general din and
chaos of the city is too distracting Youre
unable to reach that meditative state where youre
able to feel connected with nature and with the
Wildmother so Meloras guidance does not come to
you You have to continue to throw your lot in
with these strange folks that dragged you out of
your home
 All right
 Okay Youre able to attune to it and gain
the benefits of a Cloak of Elvenkind
 Well youll have to decide which
ones youre going to do
 There is the Ravens Den which sits near
the Ossuary Gates
 All righty There is the Hearth of the
Allhammer which youve messed with as well a
little bit during the festival Theres the Valley
Archive of the Cobalt Soul While it is both an
archive it is also a temple to the Knowing
Mistress There is the Kings Hall which is the
center of law and of course thats where the law
master is youve spoken with a couple of times
Thats where youve done your jobs off the
Taskboard
 Yeah theres a lot of guards there Theres
the Platinum House which is a temple to the
Platinum Dragon That also exists in the
Interstead Sprawl Not too far from Steams
Respite which is the bathhouse
 Theres also in the Signet Wall which
is the military district there is The Shrine of
the Dawn which is to the Dawnfather Its up to
you
 Okay Platinum House it is
 As you approach this beautiful but small
white building is draped in deep blue tapestries
while a reflective mirrored sphere sits atop the
roof during the day I think youve passed by and
seen it before when you were traversing the city
Are you going at day or nighttime
 Okay The inside is open archways and floor
spaces Theyre made available for worship but
also used for meditation There are a few folks in
there that are quietly eyes closed taking in the
atmosphere of the interior Theres areas for
reading and theres areas for napping and
sleeping Of the Bahamut worshiping that goes on
in places youve seen on the Menagerie Coast this
one is a little more New Agey than youre used
to About noonish when you arrive there is a
sermon beginning where there is the Herald of the
House which is a silverscaled dragonborn in his
older years He looks very tired and as withered
as a dragonborn can through their silver scales
Hes in the process of giving this very deeply
empowering speech about The majesty of Bahamut
bestows upon us the knowledge and the grace in
which we can be beacons of truth and justice in a
world that wishes to swallow all with chaos
 But yeah the midday stakeout appears to go
well What do you wish to do
 Hes there most of the day and in the
evening he appears to go nap somewhere within the
Platinum House
 Okay make an investigation check
 Sure sure
 Theres a couple entrances some hallways
 There is in the center yeah Its not built
on the floor Its actually held aloft in the
central domed archway right beneath where that
glowing dome at the top is At nighttime as
youve seen it it emits this faint white glow
and is this beacon in the middle of the darkened
city aside from the various bits of torchlight
that hit the streets Beneath this dome you see
the large carved looks like a pure platinum
but its probably a polished silver statue of
the dragon wings outstretched looking down over
the chambers and hovers about  feet off the
ground where all the rest of the folks gather for
this sermon andor sit there to meditate and pray
and worship
 Yeah at night there are less people
 What do you disguise yourself to be
 You guys approach in the evening together
Are you disguising yourself as well
 Okay Jester now taking the elderly form of
a silverscaled very wellrespected Herald of
the House Kumas You approach the temple a few
hours after sundown to where the interest in
worship tends to fade as folks go back to home
Its mostly just a few caretakers that watch it
through the night and some lost souls that have
found their way there in the evening and they need
guidance
 Make a deception check with disadvantage
because you didnt even use his name That Ive
said twice
 Deception
 Okay Of the six individuals that are here
there are two that actually are of the temple
There are four that are here meditation One
looks like a young man looking like he might be
on hard times and has tear marks on his face where
he may have been looking up to the statue and
revelling The four people that were attending see
you and Oh and they get up and start gathering
their things The two that work at the temple are
confused look at each other and look at you and
begin to walk towards you
 No theyre wearing tabards that are mostly
a silverwhite color with the symbol of Bahamut
the blue with the silver dragon Theyre simply
dressed Theyre the caretakers of the temple
lowlevel priests of the Platinum Dragon As they
approach one of them looks to be a mids human
male malepattern baldness taking a large portion
of his shorter blond hair The other one appears
to be a halfelven man as well He looks younger
but looks can be deceiving with halfelves They
both approach with a somewhat concerned look and
the halfelf speaks up first and goes Im sorry
you said that the Holy Father needs the room
cleared
 Make a perception check
 Looking around there are bowls throughout
the room Most of them appear to be empty a few
of them have a few knickknacks thrown in there
They may have been things that people left as a
gift or an offering A few copper one of them
could even have a silver You dont see any other
boxes It looks like theyre cleared out fairly
frequently
 Okay Triplechecking if Mage Hand has
 Well Disguise Self remains cast However
Mage Hand if I recall may have
 Correct but its verbal and somatic so as
theyre approaching you look back and forth and
begin casting a spell As this is happening they
both go Uh
 I wasnt aware you had an assistant
 Make a deception check
 One of them goes Oh of course my
apologies Your Grace and the human leaves The
halfelf still seems dubious Your Grace you
seem to be rather weary Perhaps I should stay and
make sure you need help
 Ill be quiet
 Of course Your Grace The halfelf
leaves but his eyes dont deviate He appears to
leave the room
 Theres open archways that lead down long
hallways and they all appear to have left the
hallways
 Okay so your Invoke Duplicitys there and
you the Platinum Dragons about  feet up
 Make an athletics check
 Using very minute ledges that are carved out
of the various temple pillars that hold up and
maintain the weight of the beautiful archways that
mark the top part of the temple you tiny rock
climb with the finger strength that only Jester
has in this whole group setup and make your way
up carefully one two leap and then grab onto
the Platinum Dragon It hangs back and forth a
bit and you can now see what you cant see from
far down is there are two sets of chains that hold
it aloft up in the temple It is free hanging and
now youre rocking back and forth
 Make a stealth check
 Okay You begin painting rainbow colors and
pulling out all your various pigments and the
platinum begins to give way to a Technicolor vomit
nightmare
 As youre getting to the mustache you hear
many many footfalls approaching and a voice
saying Yeah just this way I
 Okay As hes in the middle of talking
 Make an acrobatics check because its a
foot drop
 Wow okay A threepoint landing in the
middle Youre still
 But theres also the Invoke Duplicity of him
there so theres one he goes Thats the
 What Huh
 They give chase They go After whoever
that is There are now five crownsguard and two
members of the House giving chase down one of the
hallways
 Make a perception check to look around you as
this is happening rather rapidly
 As youre rushing down you look and theres
two open doorways One of them appears to be a
dark interior the other appears to lead to some
sort of candlelight The halls coming to an end
ahead of you Right or left which way are you
going
 Theres two open doorways One is dark on
the inside the other seems to have candlelight
from the interior
 All right you duck into the dark room
 Yeah The footfalls are coming faster and
faster behind you and Nott youre noticing that
theyre drawing weapons and one of them appears to
be pulling out some sort of a bead out of their
pocket Thats all you notice
 Well they all immediately stop and look
behind at you
 Theres five crownsguard and then two
members of the church
 Make a stealth check please
 You think you may be hidden They turn and
look at you What
 Make a deception check
 As theyre all looking the one that had the
bead goes throws it your direction
 Thats an  to hit
 Okay Let me look this up again I wasnt
expecting it to go this way
 Im going to doublecheck You make a
dexterity saving throw
 Okay so you dont take any force damage
However this sphere of translucent force has
completely encapsulated you
 And youre just slowly rolling back like

 Two of the guards come over to flank it the
other three continue their travel with the two
members of the church so theres five They then
duck into the dark room where you are as one of
them lights a torch to light up the chamber Now
you quickly made your way through this is a
storage chamber and on the inside you can see
theres a bunch of candles theres a bunch of
statues and things that are used in various
ceremonies Theres a number of wooden hanging
rods that they place a lot of vestments on that
are not used Theyre for more formal events
and celebrations and holidays You have put your
way into a corner between one of these boxes and
some of the raiments in the hope that you wont be
seen They are going to make a very thorough
investigation of the room
 They begin to slowly look through One of
the members of the church after the first 
seconds of not finding anyone darts off So
theres only four in the chamber hes going to
look elsewhere The crownsguard begin to peek
through lifting up pieces of equipment lifting
up the tops of storage containers
 The rooms about  by ten feet its not a
very large room
 Okay so roll again
 Oh
 You do You take d points of force
damage
 Five seven eight You take  points of
force damage
 So this is equivalent essentially to an
Otilukes Resilient Sphere Youre in a hamster
ball but the two guards that are right there are
flanking it and holding it in place so you cant move
 Okay As one of them turns and just manages
to pull the raiments aside revealing your face
Uh I found them  Wait No she was
right He was right I Spread out And they
all begin to scatter out into the hallways now
 You move
 Correct So with Blink at the start of your
next turn you return within ten feet of where you
vanished
 So go ahead and roll
 No thank you Keep her honest on that one
 So your form flickers for a moments as the
Youre right back in place Wait and they go
ahead
 You cast Charm Person All right it
 Okay so you can target three creatures at
rdlevel
 There are
 Four in the room total
 Oh no Because there are two guards against
him so theres three after her Yes thats
crownsguard
 And then one left so there are four in
there
 Theres three crownsguard and one member of
the house Who do you attack
 All right so they have advantage on this
save because you are technically in opposition on
this one
 So the first crownsguard with advantage
Thats going to be a  Whats the DC
  he fails Other one two sixes in a row

fail The third one two and No they all fail
Even with advantage
 So the three crownsguard come in and are
like Have you seen where this person went
Apparently someones masquerading as you
 Well go check
 The three crownsguard turn around and rush
off to find it while the member of the house the
halfelf from earlier is like Nobody Thats
Thats him Ugh and is going to rush to try and
grab you Go ahead and roll another d
 Five No its going to go for a full
grapple Its an athletics check
 Okay That is going to be a  I believe
thats a success Yeah  plus three
 However it does come in and go to grapple
you and hold you in place So youre currently now
being held in this form by the entity You can try
and break free by doing an athletics check
 Okay try it
 Your athletics check
  you are grappled
 However go ahead and roll another d
because your Blink spell is still active
 You vanish out of their grasp What the
How Begins to just Pushing things over and
looking around for wherever you may have gone
Next round you appear ten feet from where you
were Where do you want to appear
 You appear in the doorway The three guard
are in the other chamber and they are currently
You can now see into the other room where you
didnt run and it looks to be the bedchambers of
the actual Kumas
 You can hear him like Whats going on I
was trying to sleep Theyre like Ah sir
theres a Wait
 As you go running down the hallway at this
point
 The two other crownsguard who are currently
guarding Nott you see now Nott is encapsulated
in this bubble and is like Ah and one of them
is pulling out chains and cuffs on them and
theyre preparing to essentially arrest Nott once
this bubble goes away They both turn around in
the middle of this scuffle and see you running
towards them
 With advantage one of them succeeds
 two
s in a row The other
 The other one fails a seven and a one So
one of them just looks at you and smiles The one
holding the chains for Nott The other one pulls a
blade
 Make a deception check with disadvantage
 The blade is pulled out and goes Were
sorry sir We were called in here There was
apparently a disturbance and we found this one We
are preparing arrest
 Well good Hopefully theyll go ahead and
catch them We have to wait for this one
 The one you charmed goes Well Ill go
ahead and find out and then walks over to help
them while the one who resisted the charm just
sits there and takes the chains from him and is
now waiting for Nott to get out By the way roll
a d
 The other person from the house comes by
the halfelf and says You fool Thats the one
thats been Now the actual Herald of the House
comes out Hes got his pajamas on and hes like
Whats going Whats this
 Go ahead and roll a d
 Add your wisdom modifier
 Bubble vanishes Nott you fall to your
feet The guy with the chains is going to go ahead and
reach out to attempt to grapple you with them
Make an acrobatics check That was cocked
 Yes
   You slip out of it in time Roll a
d
 Seven okay You guys start bolting At this
point you can hear footsteps coming from the other
entrance hall as more folks are coming in to join
the chaos what are you doing Just full dash
 All right Laura roll a d
 As you are running Jester disappears
 Everyone behind you has eyes on you and
youre about to come back into the center of the
temple where there are two hallways that exit to
the front and the back The right and the left
both exit the temple but you also hear footsteps
coming from somewhere What are you doing
 Okay Using your bonus action you scoot
past turn left and see two crownsguard that are
approaching now hearing this commotion and you
scoot past them Hey Theyre unable to catch up
to you youre too fast but theyre giving chase
Laura you reappear ten feet from where you were
You are now again in the center of the temple and
theres a wave of people rushing towards you
Theres now two crownsguard rushing towards the
direction where Nott is and you see Nott tearing
ass away
 Yep
 Okay Now there are multiple copies of the
Herald of the House Kumas Its an army of old
dudes old dragonborns
 That would be to the right the opposite
direction that Nott went You charge that
direction You move the rest of your movement that
way  feet Roll another d
 Yeah they all do because youre not
present
 Nott youve managed to make it out into the
street now You are now out of the temple
 Make a stealth check to see if you can manage
to lose the folks that are chasing you into the street
 You manage to dodge over a few rain barrels
on the side dart down one alleyway and circle
around once and duck beneath a parked wagon
Youre pretty sure theyve lost you Theyre now
starting to scatter and give orders off in
different directions Youve caused quite a
commotion Jester youve returned into place Your
first time using Blink and youre like Oh god
Whats happening
 Yep
 Thats a full  feet of movement as youre
rushing down the other hallway You hear the
voices behind you shouting There he is Keep
going How are there so many of him Whats
going on Roll another d
 You keep running and make your way out now
into the night air
 Okay you drop Blink spells gone
 The guards are now rushing up and coming to
the edge of the exit and they can see you now
 You could try but they still have eyes
trained on you
 Youve got to try and find a way to break
eye contact with them but theyre pretty trained
on you right now
 You do get it twice You get Channel
Divinity twice
 Thats right
 The Cloak of Shadows thing All right cool
As theyre chasing you Channel Divinity You give
a silent little whispered prayer to the Traveler
to give you the opportunity to escape
 You vanish You are invisible for the next
six seconds
 Okay and with that you duck around into a
little nook on the outside of an abode or home
thats placed here on the outside of the temple
In that moment make a stealth check with
advantage because youre invisible
 Okay

 You hear the voices of the crownsguard going
on like Whatwhere Spread out Where did you
see them go I didnt see They just vanished
This is ridiculous Were all going to get into
serious trouble if we dont find them They all
begin to scatter about and you begin to weave
your way through some of the nearby alleyways into
the shadows of the night Yeah that invisibility
completely cut off their eyeline to keep following
you
 With that you manage to slowly blend back
into the night chaos
 Oh yeah Ill say that within the next
couple of days word has gotten around the city of
Zadash to the point where some of the town criers
are talking about Terrible vandalism Platinum
Dragon nearly ruined by upstarts and secret cabal
of antireligious hate
 As your evening comes to a close and you go
back to The Leaky Tap to go for a rest you have a
moment to yourself to think and have a moment to
breathe and gain a little bit of calm You sense a
presence Sitting on the bed next to you you see
the familiar dark green cloak
 I did
 I was never disappointed in the first
place Jester The hood still obscuring most of
the face just the lower jaw and mouth visible
 I did
 You dont need to see me to know that Im
with you And youre free now
 As long as you continue to be that
wonderful little seed of joy and chaos in the
world Ill be walking behind you the entire
time
 Not within my power no
 I do appreciate your artwork
 Youre improving Keep meeting new people
Tell them of what we have accomplished We want
more friends dont we
 Do you think I could have a look at that
strange relic
 The one that you procured from that
Xhorhasian warrior
 He extends his hand and takes it and looks
to it
 You see the side of the mouth of the
Traveler curl into an amused smirk Curious
Curious indeed
 I dont think Ive ever come across magic
like that
 I dont know Ive not come across it
before Im interested definitely Be careful
with that Things that are unknown are notably
able to draw dangerous and inquiring eyes and minds
 I think you should
 There are more like you out there
 Well I am worth worshipping after all
 But you are my favorite
 I hope that maybe you could all meet
someday
 Perhaps sometime next year For the day of
the Zenith in Undillar Yes I think that
 They all speak to me
 The hand reaches out and touches yours You
can feel the contact but its strangely cold You
blink and the Travelers gone
 All right
 Yeah Now lets take a break I didnt

regathered in the Leaky Tap
 The Menagerie Coast
 You dont
 Are you drinking from a Caduceus mug
 I love that Thats amazing
 You see as the blade now is this unique
merger of the falchion shape and size but now
holds this golden tint of the Summers Dance It
curves towards the edge and has a slight pointed
jagged arch in the back that the scimitar had
previously held But still contains the
barnacleencrusted pattern across the hilt and
there in the center still is the central yellow
gleaming eye

actually came out of your peehole

 And welcome back
 Last we left off The Mighty Nein having
completed their journey north and their two jobs
for The Gentleman return with a new friend a new
companion and the memory of an old You spent two
weeks in Zadash utilizing your downtime some to a
very successful level some at a nearly terribly
not successful level but managing to skirt by
Youve taken your time decided on a new path a
new adventure ahead of you loaded up your things
and currently with your cart horses and selves
together You begin making your way towards the
southern area of Zadash and out towards the roads
theres anything you need to do in the city or
forever hold your peace
 Roll a constitution check
  You can hold it for three more days
 As you guys reach the southern gates to the
exterior of Zadash with the creaking of chains
and the heavy  as the large wooden
barriers slowly drift open to allow you and a few
other carts outward onto the main road You glance
out onto the southern hills below you in the
Marrow Valley and you can see the faint dusting of
distant snow that has begun to melt in the recent
warmer days that have come The roads themselves
are slick and heavy with mud from the snow and
rainfall that has managed to still seep in You
can hear hooves making their way through the mud
as you push past the barrier Now last time you
were here you recall seeing large numbers of
military that had gathered of the Righteous Brand
of which there are very few left it looks like
most have gone eastward and found their way
towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about
on the borders of Xhorhas and the Ashguard
Garrison The gates close behind you and you
begin making your way now free again in the Marrow
Valley southward towards your destination of the
Menagerie Coast First off who is going to be
guiding this first leg of the path That is three
days of travel to Alfield along the road Whos
going to be keeping an eye out All right we have
Caleb for that Anybody helping Caleb
 Because I glossed over this last session
Caleb as you sit there holding the reins to the
horses in front and youre focusing ahead your
mind slips back into contemplative thought
recalling the time you had spent focusing on the
dodecahedron remembering when you had spent a bit
of time over this twoweek break studying and
trying your best to understand the nature of its
enchantment or history Its a strange device to
behold for sure It both seems refined and primal
You have no idea the source or the length of time
that its existed or what its true purpose is
Focusing onto it once again allowing your
consciousness to slip gently towards wherever this
object draws it in It feels like youre looking
into infinite space both within and beyond this
small geometric shape You take a moment to focus
You can sense and see light and cloud and matter
and vacuum this kind of expanse of everything and
nothing between these long stretches You feel
like theres an absence around you but the more
time you spend the more you adjust to the space
the more your vision clarifies the more the
darkness is not pure darkness but a weave of
millions of tiny threads all moving faintly
traveling in different directions tugged by some
unseen force independently You watch one thread
you pick one focus and you can see it pulling
along And it brightens and brightens and
brightens until it reaches in that tiny little
infinitesimal push a burst of light and it
changes direction And you see in that space where
that burst of light had happened you see seven
other shadowthreads begin to emerge from that
point that then fade away to nothing the thread
having now curved and taken a different path A
choice a decision made and a different destiny
for whatever that strange thread is following And
pulling back you now see the thousands tens of
thousands millions of these that all wander in
their own independent solitary directions some
crossing some parallel some alone And you
wonder what all of this means and what this has
to do with the essence of this device the powers
that it seems to impart and what it is that the
Kryn Dynasty has designs for You come back in to
your moment on the cart as youre rocking back and
forth down the pathway hearing the hooves on the
muddy now getting drier portions of the
roadway You glance around at your friends and
shake your head for a moment and focus once more
on the road before you
 Yeah
 Its gone critical
 Okay You focus and youre familiar Roll
a third character

 You who have spent a large portion of your
life in various states of meditation the
gravitational pull of whatever essence of this
object is is something you are familiar with and
comfortable letting take over And with that your
consciousness slips seemingly beyond your physical
form and into whatever dark space it seems to have
drawn you towards In this space you begin to
very quickly pick up on details similar to what
Caleb had taken so long to focus on
Independently you begin to pick up the themes and
the ideas of what all these strange threads these
 No Its it feels in a weird way like
youre

 Im just turning it down
 Shh Were roleplaying Marisha

 It doesnt feel unnatural It feels like a
view behind the curtain
 Is the best way I can describe it But it
doesnt bother you Its a little cold and a
little alien but it doesnt feel unnatural
 As you pull back you feel something comes
back with you And as your consciousness
refocuses theres a slight shred of milky grey
energy that withdraws itself and then with a warm
impact disappears into your chest
 Caleb Id like you to roll a perception
check with advantage with Caduceuss aid
 Welcome back in
  okay As you progress for the first
couple of days heading south along the road
camping without issue at the beginning of the
third day when youve begun taking your camp and
reassembling it making your way back to the
road
 Thats right yeah Which is still visible
but impenetrable And there has not been an issue
You do wake up and notice that there maybe have
been a few tracks that made their way towards your
camp They appear to be hoofbased in nature but
had wandered and circled around and made their way
beyond your location Probably just something
natural in the vicinity that was curious about
what this strange dome was in the space where you
had made camp But you gather your things you
make your way onto your cart and with the better
part of the next the third days travel right
as the sun begins to set you can see ahead the
small treeline that surrounds the nowglowing
windows of the town of Alfield
 As you begin to go closer you can see
while theres still light in the sky you can see
that there are a number of building structures
that have been reframed and it looks like there
was both a volunteer effort as well as a number
of hired masons and volunteers that are in the
process of rebuilding a lot of what had been
damaged or burned down when the gnolls had
originally assaulted it the last time you were
here By the time you reach the actual streets
making your way along the one central thoroughfare
that cuts across the center of town you can see
some of the folks who are finishing up their daily
work As theyre losing light some light up
torches and continue to work and toil into the
early hours of the evening Others begin to close
up taking their ladders down finishing for the
days work and make their way to local tavern or
homestead to make food and bed down for the
evening But as you pass by a few folks do notice
your presence look over at the cart and
recognize you and wave in your direction
 They wave and seem almost nervous excited
but both not quite sure how to act in your
presence You see one familiar halfling who had
previously lost his entire inn who glances over
in your direction
 Mmhmm
 He runs up and you can see theres a lot of
dust and bits of wood splinters on the shoulders
and edges of the sleeves as the halfling runs up
and glances over and goes I wasnt expecting to
see yall return Things are going along well
Were doing what we can
 Well weve gotten the basis of the bottom
floor mostly restored structurally Were going to
try and fill in the walls and then well head on
to the second floor there I surmise we probably
have another four months or so before were up and
operational
 Well I can lend that to most of these fine
folks whove been so gracious in helping He
points to a few other people who have either left
or are in the process of packaging up their tools
and materials as well They kind of acknowledge
and glance over I wish I could give you a room
to stay in Id do it free of charge but
 Wow Whoa
 Ill get right on it
 Well anyway I dont want to take any more
of your time I just saw you coming through and
wanted to say thank you
 Yeah
 They should be I havent seen them around
very recently but if youre going to find them
somewhere in here theyre probably
 Probably at the Broad Barn Or Actually
Bryce would be
 No Candleglow was the inn that he is
currently
 Bryce would probably be over at the Salt
Trench
 Yeah thats where theyve been keeping
their attention as of late Look at you taking
notes Im so proud
 Thats important too
 So heading over to the eastern side of
town you start finding the edge of the forest
where the street of Alfield comes to an end and
the furthest building towards the forest youve
passed it before but not spent much time in its
proximity is a dark grey stone building with a
dark weathered wood frame set around it torches
set exterior and it has the simple sign that says
the Salt Trench Jail There is one crownsguard
whos kind of leaning against the wall It looks
like theyre not asleep but definitely not in
full energy per se Long piece of some sort of a
wheat dangling out of their mouth theyre
chewing Hey can I help you
 Im going to go see if theyre available
Ill be right back
 Make a nature check
 Yeah youve heard of gnolls Youve never
seen one youve never encountered one but as far
as your knowledge goes theyre just nasty big dog
people
 At this point the guard comes back pokes
through the doorway May I ask whos asking
 Actually thats where you coined the name
 All right let me go check and heads back
in About a moment passes and you hear some
footsteps coming and there you see coming through
the doorway Bryce helmet off theyre still
wearing their armor They look a bit overworked
maybe not getting enough sleep a little bit of
dark circles under the eyes but other than that
healthy Their blond shoulderlength hair has a
soft curl to it is pulled up in the back and
looks to be tied to keep out of the way As they
come through the door frame a smile on their
face I wasnt expecting company let alone such welcome
 Its good to see you
 Im working wherever its necessary I keep
watch on here I help the Starosta maintain
general matters here with the Crownsguard but
stationed wherever its necessary Were a bit
light on manpower given the bulk of it is required
now to the eastern side of the Empire
 In theory which is why Im not sleeping as
well But its good to see you Jester
 Both
 None thankfully We took them down last
week but it was decided that recovering some of
these gnolls that you had slaughtered and as
garish as it was placing their heads as a
warning on the outskirts of town prevented for a
while any sort of incursions Seemed to be a
decent deterrent However the smell got a bit
intense for the farmers and we decided to dispose
of them But everything seems fine Were far
enough from all that chaos to the east Hows
everything been with you Last I saw you you were
heading to Zadash I apologize it took a little
bit with the chaos here but I just sent a report
up to the Lawmaster up there Orentha should know
of your deeds soon
 I gave a brief description
 Right Whats your name
 Bryce Bryce Feelid
 Thats all right Pleasure to meet you You
are very tall and strange
 Well welcome to Alfield Any friends of
these are friends of ours
 Of course Are you passing through Or
youve come to stay for a bit
 Well of course of course You need not
worry about finding lodging we can have that arranged
 Weve done that before we can do it again
Well I have a little bit more business to attend
to and then Ill be off my shift and perhaps Ill
join you for drinks
 Just a moment If you wouldnt mind go
ahead and let Crute know that youve arrived at
the Feed  Mead tavern and Ill meet you there in
an hour or so
 Its lovely to see you all
 Me too Bryce turns around and then comes
back Theres one your other friend with the
 Right At this point they nod their head
Say no more Weve all lost our share of loved
ones This world can be a dangerous one at times
Im sorry for your loss
 Well come Ill meet you soon and well
have drinks in his honor
 Then Bryce makes their way back inside the
building You guys are welcome to do anything else
you wish to prepare for though it is starting to
get into the evening hours and based on your
previous experience in Alfield you know this is
one of those towns that primarily shuts down
postsunset This is mostly a farming town
 You guys make your way to the Feed  Mead
Crute recognizes you as you enter Its good to
see all of you again Welcome Please sit down I
will prepare food I suppose for many more than I
was expecting
 Good to know
  All of the windows slam open
loudly Theres the sound of breaking glass on the
far side as one of the windows is shattered from
the impact Wind swoops in and you watch as
Crute whos faced away making the way to the
kitchen stops and goes 
 Makes his way into the kitchen to finish the
meal An hour or so passes a couple other folks
come in Some of them dont seem to recognize you
or didnt interface with you directly A handful
do and they come by and offer to buy a drink
Crute returns with some basic foods most
everything here is everything from lightly cooked
vegetables or boiled vegetables to some treated
and salted meats They dont have a wide variety
of dishes here but it is still delicious and very
classic homeontheroad food Bryce eventually
comes and joins you the first time youve seen
them out of their formal attire and armor Bryce
comes in with a light blue soft tunic over some
light brown leggings and comfortable boots Very
relaxed and casual as they sit down at the table
and take an unclaimed tankard and leans back in
the chair Well I think weve all earned this Cheers
 To friends here and not
 And Nott
 The normal recovery Thankfully only one
and a half fields were torched in the gnoll
onslaught so hasnt been a huge detriment to our
farming schedule Other than that its been the
Righteous Brand passing through
 Theres one of them right over there One
of the individuals that came up and offered to buy
you drinks earlier you can see its one of the
older bearded gentlemen who looks to be a little
you recognize him now once its pointed out
 Ey Told you they remembered me
 They never forget a face The Mighty
Nein
 They all do if youre not paying attention
Theres word that the Ashguard Garrison has
fallen Ive been doing the best I can to keep my
ear to the ground on things happening east Its
far enough away where no one heres worried but I
have friends in Bladegarden and who were stationed
at the Rockguard which is the other garrison If
ones fallen I worry for the other But I know
theyre sending all of their forces that way and
 You did hear about this from one of the town
criers a little over a month ago when you were
leaving on The Gentlemans errand
 Probably I have to look back at my notes
again
 Its okay The time period in there its
somewhere in that space
 From what Ive heard theyve kept it at bay
and there are intents to retake the garrison but
there were well over  lives lost and I dont
know how much there is specifically to say about
but the rumors are that the sky over that pass
over the garrison itself lie as dark as midnight
throughout the day even
 Oh That makes sense if youre leaving
Zadash Well in times of warfare and I know
weve been notified of this via the information
routes to the rest of the crownsguard and the
watchmasters to keep an eye but I do believe
entrance to the Empire is being very carefully
inspected You shouldnt have an issue leaving 
its coming back in during a time of conflict
like this might take a while
 I can try and write you something but
once again were a bit podunk here by comparison
I cant say that those at the Wuyun Gates are
going to be more partial to what I have to say
but I can try
 The Starosta here Yes but if I recall
the last time you spoke wasnt on the most
positive terms either
 Some tricks you may get one shot with Id
be worried He tends
 I havent heard any of this
 No keep talking please Just know that
Ive heard nothing as they put their fingers in
their ears
 Wait till after I leave if you dont mind
You know protocol
 Exactly A little plausible deniability
doesnt hurt either
 Always but he does good work and hes
spearheaded organizing many of these
reconstruction efforts and maintaining a means of
getting influxes of gold from Rexxentrum The
crown has been very good in sending money as
necessary because the Starosta has been so
diligent in the connections he has So yes hes
a prick and hes a bit of a pain in the ass on our
end but I mean hes not terrible at his job So
what can I say
  Da da da da da da I have to work
with him often
 Call that the continental

 Bryce at this point goes Well folks I
think this is my cue to get some rest Its been
great catching up a bit with all of you Stay
safe
 You as well
 Cheers again If ever you find your way
near this podunk side of the Empire again youll
always have a place to stay in Alfield Heck
maybe if all this business to the east is finished
before long and I get some time off maybe Ill
come visit you up in Zadash
 Its been a while
 I havent been there since I was a child
 Theres too many people here that depend on
me I cant
 I appreciate that They stand up leave a
few coins on the table
 Right okay All right They take the
coins finish the drink walk over to the bar and
set them on the counter anyway and then walk
away Good night
 And they walk away
 Here yeah
 Yeah the room is already provided Your
delightfully pleasant evening purveyor of down
pillows and blankets Crute is ever eager to show
you where you can leave him the fuck alone You
manage to find your rooms and rest for the
evening The following morning you gather your
things the cart has been taken care of
 Indeed you can
 All right In the morning breakfast is
provided for you There are a few folks that are
in here finishing their breakfast before going out
in the fields going about their daily business
and as you descend to your breakfast meal you
watch half the room go quiet as they all watch
you Throughout the rest of the meal they lock
eyes in a very I dont know how to act kind of a
way but not in a bad way Pardon Some of you
especially arent used to being the person that
walks into a room and being stared at but the
energy is different here Theres definitely more
of a reverence Its kind of a nice change of
pace
 Some of the Zemnian Critters out there will
tweet you the pronunciation
 Yes
 Trostenwald Thats the next one on your
trip
 Its the final town to the south
 All right you guys gather your things back
up into the cart Its been brought around front
You get your horses ready for the next leg of your
journey If you want to collect feed for the
horses along the way since youve been traveling
for a few days if someone wants to mark off
 Ill say another gold worth of feed that
you
 All right
 All right continuing south Caleb are you
maintaining your position on the cart
 Okay
 All right Caleb takes a break at the back
as Caduceus makes his way to the front of the
cart grabs the reins Jester you go ahead and
plop alongside You eventually turn your way
heading westward
 Which you can do
 Okay but you go ahead and ask permission of
the horses
 You watch as Caduceus comes and quietly
talks to each of the horses and it seems
ridiculous at first but as he finishes talking to
the horse the horse nudges alongside him and
gives a hoof clop on the ground
 With that Caduceus gets up onto the cart
next to Jester pulls on the reins and with that
you guys begin to make your exit from Alfield a
second time
 I dont know if you can just now do that or
if youve always been able to do that and then
Ronins your eventual payment of the contract
 I know exactly As you guys are exiting
Alfield a few more folks come out to the street
a woman people that you recognize as individuals
you had helped make their way out of the mines
long ago and you see them wave and they all say Goodbye
 A kid quietly raises a hand smiling too
shy to say anything and with that you make your
way past the final buildings out of Alfield and
back onto the road south
 Two days travel to Trostenwald from
Alfield so which one of you wants to helm the
first watch
 All right so roll with advantage on your
perception check please
 Towards the end of the first days travel
afternoon as youre keeping an eye out you
glance over what looks to be and you do find a
few clusters of stone and rock that break up the
rolling hills and tall grass that make up a large
part of the southern part of the Marrow Valley
that youre used to You who come from a very
northern borderline tundra north of the
Savalierwood
 Yeah taiga in places You can see this very
green and open field is a whole new experience to
you and youre enjoying the details of it as you
across the road and get snatched up by a hawk and
youre like yep thats how it happens
 As youre glancing about you can see a lot
of these natural stones placed and you see one
cluster of stones that doesnt look naturally
placed theyre leaned at an odd angle If it had
been placed at or if it had been at that angle
for a while it wouldve eventually settled
 As you glance over you can see three
stones and one of them is about this big its a
pretty heavy stone and two longer slab stones
and theyre all leaned against each other to look
natural but Caduceus doesnt seem to feel that
way
 Its about from where you are now as
youve traveled closer its about  to  feet
to the left off the road
 Make a strength check
  It arcs falls maybe about ten feet
short in the grass No reaction
 Okay so as far as Thaumaturgy you cant
throw your voice so much as you can amplify
the volume
 Ill say you can throw it a little bit You
cant flank it per se but you can give it a
little more of a force from one side Ill say
 Yeah if you want
 Okay It shakes a bit and you can see some
bits of loose rock on top of this weird stone
construct begin to vibrate fall off the side No
reaction
 The rest of you keep looking at this pile of
stones and it just looks like a pile of stones
Youre like Really So Frumpkins heading up
 Frumpkin gets low to the grass
 Make a perception check for Frumpkin
 Frumpkin does a little pass around the side
and there doesnt appear to be anybody in or
around them from what Frumpkin can see
 Sure Frumpkin leaps onto the top and
perches up there 
 Its a strange view to see yourself walking
towards yourself Its like playing Resident Evil
 where you have the locked camera
 Thats technically how Shakste sees the
world when you think about it Its all of
existence through a series of Resident Evil camera
angles The Duchess man
 Well he can turn a lot better
 You all slowly approach this strange pile of
rocks settled here
 No its an open field There are some trees
maybe   feet off This part of the field
theyre small clusters four or five at a time
Its mostly open rolling hills
 No youre days away That was east of the
city You guys are heading south
 All together probably about four feet
tall
 Make an investigation check if you want
to
 As you get down inside
 Okay  As you get down to the stones
theres the one larger central stone and there are
the two ones laid against it Theres a very small
space in between there and you get inside and
begin to look around the ground and you feel
down and theres nothing Its mainly dirt and
dry brush and dead grass thats been pushed in
that centerpiece You reach up and your hand
touches something
 It feels like a satchel or a leather sack
 Frumpkin crawls inside and looks up and
there is indeed a leather pouch roughly the
size of a baseball that has been jammed up
between the rocks to the point where its being
held up underneath out of sight
 Okay As you pull the bag out from the
rock it comes free
 As you open the bag its fine
 I dont know let me have my little fun You
open inside and you already hear the impact of a
bunch of tiny stones and as you look inside there
are gems in here It is a collection of cut jewels
 Its mostly emerald and ruby Theres a lot
of them and theyre jammed up in here You get
the sense immediately that this was a drop spot
Someone will probably be coming by to try and pick
this up
 Okay You fill the small leather sack with
rocks
 Follow your nose
 Thats a ten minute casting time to cast as
a ritual Okay
 Make a survival check
 Nice I believe its wisdom
 Thats true yeah Its not charisma
thankfully You feel pretty confident that youve
managed to erase most any sign of any tampering or
movement by human beings or adjacent entities
What are you trying to do Jester Someone over
here was trying to do something
 Perception check Beau
 Hes focusing
 Okay Keeping an eye out it doesnt appear
that theres any immediate sign of anyone
approaching By the time you finish completing the
ritual you do a quick pass over There are many
magical auras around you but theyre your
friends The various objects theyre wearing and
equipped light up but theres nothing beyond
expected
 You guys jog back to the cart get up
inside and start making your way south along the
trail again with if someone wants to write it
down approximately  gold worth of gems
Rubies and emeralds Because of a really high
perception check on Caduceuss end
 You make your way south along the trail You
have one more day of travel before you get to
Trostenwald Caduceus are you still leading
 Roll one more perception check
 As you guys are heading southward on the
second day Caduceus you notice coming up over
one of the hills a single horse with a single
rider moving at a very quick speed
 Heading towards your direction heading
northward
 So Caleb
 The two of you are at the front of the cart
Everyone else
 Everyone in the bed is not visible They are
held behind the illusion
 As the rest of you head back into the
illusion you continue moseying forward on the
cart and you hear the hooves getting louder and
closer As they go screaming by you at the side
theres that moment where time seems to slow as
you see that individual their face mostly covered
by a dark red or purple bit of cloth like a
facemask A hood that is up but slipping back and
a little bit of tousled black hair with a little
bit of salt and pepper on the sides A large cloak
underneath with a cloth mantle over thats also
blowing behind slowly Darkly dressed like a
highwayman that is in the process of trying to get
somewhere quickly whether it be with a delivery
or trying to meet up with somebody In that moment
you watch them glance out the side of their eye at
the two of you in the cart and then race off Not
slowing not stopping
 I put Travis in the game Meta
 No the hood was starting to come back from
the wind as the rider tried to keep it down
 No from the little bit of face showing
around the eyes it looked like it had been fairly
tanned probably from sun and a lot of travel out
in the open They took one quick but very detailed
glance towards the two of you and then screamed on
ahead northward past the cart
 Then you continue southward For the better
part of the next day you eventually can see as
you come around one bend where some of the larger
hills are beginning to weave around the road as it
begins to curve left and right In the distance a
number of birds are starting to fly in larger
flocks and encircling what now reveals itself to
be the familiar sight of the Ustaloch below You
can see ahead of you the city of Trostenwald
where a lot of your crazy adventures together
began Its not quite dusk Youre about two hours
from dusk You begin to make your way down towards
the city itself Its as busy and lazy as you
remember As you reach the outer streets of the
township there are people coming up and down the
various streets with carts and wares You can see
folks that are passing through hopefully on a
trade route Some folks that look like theyre
stuck here A lot of carts that are built up on
the outside that are either waiting for some sort
of sign to continue travel or are still packing
up before they leave for whatever their next
destination may be What would you like to do If
anything
 You guys make your way to the Nestled Nook
You come upon the familiar tavern Entering
inside you can see the familiar face of Yorda
the older woman who runs the tavern and glances
up from wiping off a table in the far corner
before her eyes peer over towards you from her
tousled blond hair Oh hello there Its some
familiar faces Its been some time Welcome
Well do sit down Drinks Rounds What are you
asking for
 Trost it may be All right But youre in
Trost theres quite a few Trostenwald brews
 Von Brandt it is
 All right table of von Brandts
 Milk for that one Of course All right
Ill be right back Yorda makes her way to go
fill the rest of your order You guys take a while
here and rest in for a bit You see Adelaine
whos the other barmaid thats helping with the
tavern in the process of going around and filling
the few orders that she has to at this hour
Kluss the clerk the reedylooking young man is
in the back currently going through paperwork and
trying to keep tabs on a number of ledgers and
business elements The evening is yours Do you
wish to do anything or are you going to bed down
for the evening and continue the following day
 Adelaine
 Adelaine makes her way to your table
Hello You looking for something
 Im sorry I dont think I know a Gustav
 He was working off his debt You dont know
the specific circumstances of it
 Of course sorry Would you like anything
else
 Right away
 Ill see what we have in the back
Adelaine goes off and does return with milk and
its a little old its starting to get some of
that white powder fringe to the chocolate but
its functional
 A bowl is retrieved for you quite easily As
Yorda throws it on the table Would you like
something in the bowl dear
 Milk itll be And she goes and returns
with a bowl about halffilled with milk
 You look down under the table at Frumpkin
sitting at the bowl going
 
 As Frumpkin begrudgingly at the command of
his master enjoys a bowl of milk
 Its fine Frumpkin can drink milk Frumpkin
just has no need for it
 Its a placebo for the master Its like
If it makes the master happy Ill drink this
milk for you
 Yeah exactly And you get the sense too
that the entire time that Frumpkin is drinking
from this bowl Frumpkin is making direct eye
contact with Caleb
 Right now its about dusk By the time
youve come in the city youve come to the inn youve
got food and drinks and you settled for a bit
its about dusk now
 Yeah You guys have bought everything for
Nott
 Frumpkin sideeyes you while you both drink
the milk together
 Okay So where are you guys headed
 Its the stockade The stockade here is
where you had previously
 Yep just to fuck with you All right so
you guys make your way to the stockade and it
takes a brief intro to the crownsguard outside
before you are brought back in One of them
recognizes you from your previous encounter a few
months back and brings you to Nordas office a
familiar place youve been Norda you can see
the dwarven woman with very a tense and tired and
just kind of overit expression on her face
glances up at you all All right so its been a bit
 Well the good news is nothing else died
since youve come back Thats
 positive So when are you leaving
 Great news Thats wonderful
 Why are you in my office at this hour
 You want to see Gustav
  Fine She gets up from behind the
desk and goes and reaches into this cubby and
pulls out a ring of keys and Follow me Leads
you back down into the familiar stair down below
to a cell where a couple of you have been held
before And there you can see on the far end
there is a cell and within this dark
subterranean interior with the faint burning
torchlight gives this ominous redorange flicker
to the normally shaded interior You see there
slumped against the wall enjoying a bowl of some
sort of gray mushy substance a not
abusedandfilthy but
alittlerougharoundtheedges Gustav Not
chained not shackled and there is a chair and
there is a bed You can see of the jail cells
here which are designed to just be abysmal this
one some pains have been made to make it a
little more comfortable
 Roughly about two and a half months yeah
 Best estimate Even a little longer Im
sure CritRoleStats will let me know But in the
proximity there Norda comes up Hey Gustav
Youve got visitors Clinks the keys against the
bars and Oh um sorry Thats embarrassing
He finishes a spoonful sets it down Oh my my
my I was not expecting this at all And you can
see the lanky elvish gentleman his hair pushed
back a bit greasy a bit of dirt on the edges of
the face wearing the same nice long coat that you
remember him wearing when you last saw him off
Looks like hes been doing some hard work
probably a little thinner than even his previously
thin form was but hes there He approaches the
edge of the bars By what might I have the
pleasure of you all coming to see me
 Thats all right I myself have as well
dont worry
 Oh its not preferable by any means but
it certainly beats going in here against my will
 Oh at the rate weve been going And he
looks over towards Norda Nordas like If he
keeps working as hard as he has been hes looking
at another seven eight months maybe
 I have to go look at the books but I can
go check
 What you going to pay him off
 Gustav at this point leans forward and
goes You are all very sweet and I greatly
appreciate it but this is my debt to pay not
yours
 Norda goes You two keep an eye And the
two crownsguard approach and get a bit closer
while Norda heads back upstairs Gustav still
pressed against the bars his head peeking through
the two sides bit of scraggly hairs falling in
front of his face No but Im completely
serious This is my burden I chose it Youve all
done good work here and
 Make an insight check
 
 But sincerely I am very appreciative Each
and every one of you
 Well
 Im just musing on how we found him and how
we left him
 A brief star burning very bright but twice
as short But no when we found him outside of the
forests up north he had no memory no voice no
words He was basically a vegetable But over
time he came back to his senses and yeah Its a
shame He was a good one
 Well Thats the dangers of the world we
live in I suppose
 This is me paying my debt
 I dont know who you are friend but
youve stepped into a space where you have no
knowledge and trust me this is my debt to pay
This is my responsibility
 Anyway I should finish my meal
 He goes over and grabs the bowl and
quietly while looking at Caduceus begins to eat
his gray mush
 You can move out of earshot
 You bump into the Crownsguard behind you
Oh excuse me
 At this point Norda returns coming
shuffling back down with a small leatherbound
journal or book of some kind All right Looking
at this one keeping tabs on what hes able to
make the reparations hes made the amounts of
money he was able to have brought in from friends
to help pay the debt were still sitting at about
 gold pieces
 
 Are you asking
 What are you a buyout
 Hes fucking weird Ill tell you that
 Make a persuasion check
 Tell you what you go ahead and toss down
about  right now Ill kick his ass out
 Gustav has come back to the bars and is
like You all are being absurdly generous
 and this is not necessary at all I mean
it I mean it
 You were one of many Theres at least at
any given point in time  headaches in here so
yeah thats one of them
 The crownsguard to the left of you goes
You should listen to her Those bedpans are
pretty terrible
 Make one last persuasion check
This will be at a higher DC
 What do you say to assist her
 You watch as the Lawmasters eyebrow raises
to the
 For the first time since youve seen Norda
you see a smile curl across her face She goes
If thats not the weirdest thing Ive seen in
some time Make your check with advantage
  and well call it even
 I know isnt it
 Thats a thousand 
 So you only need a hundred
 Nott threw down a thousand
 The crownsguard begin gathering the money
from you guys and bringing over small chests to
put the large amount of coin over As this is
happening Gustav leans his back towards the
stones at the edge and his eyes are just wide in
disbelief I dont know what to say
 Thank you
 Whats the DC on that Is it a charisma
save
 Thats a natural eight
 He sits there eyes wide
 Norda takes the keys and heads over and
opens it up All right punk youre a free man
Congratulations For some odd reason these folks
decided that you were worth a lot of money to not
be here so be thankful that somehow the great
gods have looked down upon you and Erathis
decided You know what fuck law Youre free
So the guards escort him out You guys all head to
the outside You all get led outside of the
stockade and Norda says All right well thats
been a pleasure Im going to go ahead and go
home have a drink and get some fucking sleep
 Dont get anyone else killed She heads
back inside Gustav is stepping out there his hat
that he just had retrieved and given back to him
he puts on steadies his coat grabs the small
sack of his personal belongings and turns around
to the rest of you I  Thank you This
is more than I would have expected
 I dont know I mean the circus is
scattered I would ask where Yasha was she would
be a good righthand man but I dont see her
around Did she also
 Huh Menagerie Coast Havent been there in
a long time
 Oh Im fine Thank you I appreciate it I
should probably tie up some loose ends now that I
have availability to do so Thanks to you and your
generosity
 Mmhmm
 Make an intimidation check
 It can ride a line
 I appreciate your candor and advice tall
furry man Maybe Ill find an ear to bend one day
Until then let Gustav Fletching be forever your
humble servant
 Sure Ive got nothing else going on Come
find me
 Well then come find me
 Im sure Well good night He walks off
on his lanky legs almost bending with each step
Hes such a strange gangly elf Youve never
quite seen an individual of his physicality
 Yeah
 Sure
 Its more of a You have to save it but
you catch it
 As you guys make your way back to the
Nestled Nook Inn having seen what has become of
Gustav and changed the trajectory of his journey
as well you all ruminate on the rather large sum
of money youve given for what you hope is a good
cause have another drink and find your way to
bed And thats where well take a break
 That was really interesting I wasnt
expecting that
 That was a  insight
 Fair enough I had to go to the wiki to find
out how much money he still owed

 Oh this is not going away is it
 So
 So after taking the evening at

 in Trostenwald in the tavern you rest
up The following morning as the sun rises into
the sky you have your meals you prepare
yourselves for the next leg of your journey Is
there anything else you wish to accomplish while
in Trostenwald or do you wish to
 Totally Got to keep it going Upkeep its
important for a monk
 There you go Different kind of working
out
 Lets see here
 So yeah Indeed there is Natural Remedies
there is the Lochward General What are you
looking for specifically
 It would be tar and other
 Well its a series of chemicals Tar
amber resin and things that are pulled from tree
sap There are other processes where you can
distill that down along with some more crude
clays to create this kind of adhesive If youd
like to
 Okay So you can go ahead and do that Go
ahead and make a general deception check
 Okay So you
 So negative one
 
 Its not high stakes here not high stakes here
You go ahead and meet with Simon Earth of
the Natural Remedies shop You can acquire the
goods you need at the cost specifically the
materials that youre trying to make if youre
trying to do something alchemical at the cost of
what it requires
 You get through one round of discussions
with him before you begin to notice crownsguard
getting interested in your presence One of them
for some reason his eye caught you strange and he
noticed something odd about the illusion and your
physicality and seems to be You and this shop
dont have a very good history
 You say loudly as you exit the facility The
crownsguard are keeping a distance but theyre
definitely trailing you from about   feet
behind
 They walk a little brisker keeping pace
with you
 Okay Make a stealth check
  Okay You dodging into the alleyway
using what looks like one of the open window sills
on the first floor and the edge railing of the
rooftop of this building thats immediately there
you dart up and manage to get your small goblin
form up onto the roof out of the point of view
You hear the crownsguard round the corner and run
inside and begin looking around You see them
pushing barrels over and one of them who seems to
be leading this charge is like Well fucking
hell where the hell did she go Its probably
just my brain playing tricks on me And you hear
them slowly walk away They werent fully invested
in a chase They were more just mistrusting and
curious
 So youre back with the rest of the troupe
You guys have all your stuff gathered together to
continue the rest of this journey If you want to
do anything alchemical it will take time with the
kit to do so
 So Gathered up back onto the cart who is
leading this next leg of the journey Is it
continuing Caduceus
 All right so the two of you make your way
to the front of the cart and get heading
southward It is four days of travel to the Wuyun
Gate
 To the Wuyun Gate Its the southern gates
that mark the very edge of the southern portion of
the Empire So Go ahead and make a perception
check Since Beau is helping you with advantage
  okay Well say for the sake of brevity
here the first two days of travel thanks to your
tent as well and staying off the beaten path
during times of rest you manage to find some good
hidden areas and no issues happen at night during
the restful period The second day goes by without
issue You do see a small grouping of merchants
making their way northward with largely what is a
chain of oxen It looks like they have about  or
so of them that are chained together and theyre
heading northward having made their way through
the gates for some sort of a sale or trade Its
a curious spectacle as they come by Its one cart
and just a lot of oxen giant horns slowly making
their way northward As you pass around for the
third day and fourth day go ahead and make
another perception check
 Mmhmm
 Damn
 Apparently Which brings you to a total of
  Okay
 As you get to the very very southern side
of this valley you begin to see as the Cyrios
Mountains and the Ashkeeper Peaks begin to come
and point together towards the actual Wuyun Gorge
which is this central ravine between the two
mountain ranges that heads southward and exits the
Marrow Valley entirely As you approach you begin
to see the actual Wuyun Gates which are these
tall  foot high cant quite tell the width of
it Youve traveled through these before once with
Jester before coming into the Empire You know the
width of these walls is at least ten feet to 
feet wide at its base The central gates
themselves are not stone but they are two very
large iron reinforced wooden doors that stand
about  feet tall and are opened and closed by
chained based wenches that rotate and open and
close from each side of the interior of the wall
Your vision catches a troupe of about  or so
soldiers Not dressed in the same bits of armor as
the crownsguard that youve seen as youve
traversed most of this countryside but a
different set of armor Largely bright red maroons
and golds Looks like there are some tents and
theres an encampment set on this side off to the
eastern edge of the gate
 They are the Righteous Brand
 As you guys get closer and closer to the
gates you can see six crownsguard that are
painstakingly inspecting every cart and travel
wagon that is making its way through the gate
They are stopping one by one and going through and
poking and prodding and moving things in the carts
to look for any stowaways looking for hidden
materials In this time of warfare it looks like
there is a very thorough process And you can see
the gates are open
 You guys are about  feet away He caught
a vision of it very distantly and you guys are
They havent quite noticed your presence yet or if
theyve noticed it they havent taken stock of it
because theyre focused on their task
 Nope It is
 Well the mountain range has come together
into this central gorge What was previously tall
grass plains with rolling hills and bits of rock
has thinned out to be bits of scrub and then hard
rock floor Youve left the central valley and
youre hitting more mountainous terrain
 Make an arcana check
 Youre the one who had the question
 You contemplate over this enchantment that
theyve told you about the cart You guys watch as
Caduceus stares out into space a bit before this
trickle of blood begins to come of his nostril
 Its hard to Make an arcana check
yourself actually
 It depends on the basis of the enchantment
If theyre very powerful items then there are
sometimes means of temporarily subduing the
enchantment Objects that are a little more
common or the enchantments themselves are not as
thorough it is a dispel and gone type scenario
 On this side of the road Youre the only
one There is one that is in the gates right now
thats full inspection and you can now see from
this distance that Caduceus has pointed out
beyond the open gates you can see a cluster of
other carts Theres a line trying to make their way
 Their arm would essentially vanish as they
put their arm through the illusion
 In that brief moment Fjord
 you feel this momentary release like a
tether that previously had gone unseen is
loosened And there in that brief bit of
unexpected freefloating freedom amongst the
darkness that warm gray centered energy drifts
towards you Your fightorflight kicks in
momentarily but you consciously recall that your
friends have been through this Seems safe And
with that it drifts towards you and in this
weird familiar sense youve had more than one
object just enter your torso As it warmly touches your
chest and dissipates within the inside of your
body your consciousness shifts back out of your
concentration mode on the dodecahedron and you
can feel that lingering warmth still around your
sternum beneath your armor as you release your
hands from the object
 All right
 So as you all Walking alongside your cart
towards the Wuyun Gates the crownsguard begin to
take notice of your presence and you can see the
one cart that was being inspected at the gates is
given apparently the clear They load their
materials back into it and begin making their way
northward passing you as you head south
 Of which sort
 You begin to hit a point and theres
enough room for maybe three carts to make it
through here but theyre keeping it a twolane
scenario here this pincher point There is a cart
now thats begun inspection and about three
different crownsguard are going through and
rifling and lifting things out of the way As you
begin to approach the crownsguard put a hand up
and guide you over with hand signals to the area
to the immediate right of it around ten feet to
the west of the other cart The captain
approaches You can see a woman in brownish red
hair a bit sunbleached at the tips pulled up
into a soft ponytail high on the head and the
crownsguard armor itself looks wellkept You can
see from the decorations as youve seen it
before this is a captain Approaches Halt What
is your business and where are you going
 Very well And what are you carrying across
the border please
  Two of the crownsguard come over
towards the cart and goes But what is within
these sacks and small boxes
 You emptied the cart but the illusion
Ive explained multiple times is an illusion of
standard sacks and boxes
 Make a persuasion check
 All right Appreciate you being
forthright The two other guards come forward
and you watch as they place their blades into and
watch them vanish and go like
 Looking back at the captain and begin to
poke forward and you watch as their torsos vanish
beyond the veil of the illusion and pull back
Dualla The captain approaches and herself
leans in and pulls back You are not incorrect
you carry nothing on your carts This is a curious
nature of an enchantment indeed And you said
youre heading to Nicodranas and Port Damali to
acquire goods What are you looking to acquire
 Make a deception check
 She gives you a close look not leaving
direct eyeline to your pupils and hers and
watches you through the entire statement and
then Very well Move along
 Well the inspection will be far more
thorough that time
 All right Stay safe
 The boundaries who knows whats wandering
from the dark side of Xhorhas there Eyes on your
backs Go And the crownsguard pull away and the
ones on the opposite end open the space for you
guys to move your cart along With that you pass
through the gates of the Wuyun Gorge
 Make a perception check
 No It doesnt look like theres been any
scuffle no attacks they havent taken any tear
from any sort of conflict it looks like from
this end But there are more guards up along the
top along the walkway above the wall Previously
you guys had seen two crossbowmen that were there
Theres now ten The Righteous Brand themselves
while about  or so of them have been encamped in
that one encampment the rest of about  or so
are scattered amongst different points on the
mountains around the gate and are all scouts
keeping eyes out for anyone trying to circumvent
the pinch point Theres pretty heavy interest in
keeping watch on these borders given the current
conflict to the east But you pass through safely
allowed by the crownsguard and within a few
moments you pass into the Wuyun Gorge proper and
a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that
for the first time you are no longer in the
Dwendalian Empire So you pass by the six or seven
carts that are in line and theres arguments and
frustration Some of them are currently very
vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are
holding them to wait their turn You keep your
heads down and continue forward There you start
heading into this large mountain pass Extremely
steep at certain points where the mountains seem
to be have been carved down or bisected by some
ancient cataclysm whether it be the Calamity or
some great natural disaster long before that It
seems to be a very unique singular cleft down in
the center of these two mountains that breaks the
mountain range between the Cyrios and the
Ashkeeper Whos keeping youre at the front of this
 Go ahead and make a perception check for me
please
 As youre stalking ahead riding before you
can see theres bits of rock formations that have
been pushed through by some sort of ancient
seismic activity There are pieces of rock that
are platformed over and there are outcroppings
and caverns that have naturally been pushed out of
the sides of this large ravine Its quiet here
with the occasional echoing sound of birds
squawking and cawing to each other Theres a
faint wind occasionally drifting through in
pulses Its warm The sun is above and whereas
previously you have been encountering the colder
winter especially further north of the Marrow
Valley where the snowfalls have been rather
consistent the warm clothes that many of you have
been wearing in that weather are beginning to
capture the heat of this southern area and as the
sun is now high in the sky cloudless the blue
above you the beads of sweat begin to form across
your back beneath your clothing Caduceus you
hear this faint guttural muttering of some kind
What languages do you know
 
 With that roll Yes you would Looking
ahead and you guys have traveled a number of
hours past the gates about  feet ahead of you
behind one of these rock formations you can see
the vague outline of some sort of large hulking
figure leaned against it
 You see the outside of a humanoid shoulder
and the back of a matted bit of greased hair
maybe standing  feet tall
 Its about  feet ahead of you and to the
right
 Okay
 Yep So its a charisma saving throw
 Its a natural five with a minus one Thats
going to be a no
 The tension and you guys can as Caduceus
has pointed out this figure you can see it tense
against the stone and you see it was reaching
down Just out of sight there was some large
rocky formation that it had its arms on and it
leans back a bit and shakes its head and as it
pulls just beyond the outline of the rock you can
see a second head right next to the first Two
heads on one set of shoulders They both shake
away from each other then together and away and
one looks to the other and just waves in your
direction
 Mostly no clothing other than a bit of
tattered leather and hide and furs that are matted
around the midsection and dangling almost past the
knees
 As the cart moves past another voice also
 You look over to the other
side and from around another rock you see
another one of them whos looking livid at the
other one Go ahead and make an arcan this would
be technically its a giant
 Make a general intelligence check
 If anybody would like to make a general
intelligence check on this
 Yeah these are Ettins
 Ettins are large giantkin twoheaded
beasts and they dont normally work in pairs
you know this instinctively because they argue
enough between their two heads To have two
working together is already a very strained
relationship And the other one whos yelling at
the one across the way as you guys are in
between you recognize it as saying What Why
Stupid Right there Dont wave And the other
head goes What he said Im going to go ahead
and just for the sake of this to give you some
visual perspective
 It may not come to that but I want to give
you a visual
 So you guys would be right about there
 All right so general positioning
 Caduceus
would be in the front with Jester there
 Or no was Beau here in the front
 There you go Thatll work there Well say
youre in the cart there Haphazardly
 And so this is the one that came around this
end
 They literally have two heads
 So this one currently under the Calm
Emotions which youre concentrating on The other
one is yelling at it  pointing
at you and the other guy is like confused
monster yelling
 Okay
 Pushing slowly forward Trotting along that
way This guy comes out and begins arguing loudly
with the other as he comes forward too shouting
at him and theyre both yelling over both of you now
 You shut up You no hun you speak
same
 And the one who you didnt cast it on is
like You so dumb You two not listen Ruin this
 You push ahead a little bit further
 And whats the saving throw on that one
 That is a natural  And whats the wisdom
save
 Its a Wisdom save you said Yeah thats a
failure So that one
 goes from arguing and goes like Well
fine You wont finish this we do it ourselves
And they reach over and grab this large boulder
and begin to pick it up and at that point Caleb
finishes his incantation and they go boulder
crashing noise drop it  and
just start running the opposite direction as the
cart begins to slowly roll forward
 Begins charging off this way
 This guy just turns around and begins to
like waves back to you and heads around that direction
 Calm Emotions is
 Thats okay It also only lasts a minute
 So these guys both run off the side there
 So as you guys continue running
 Kind of yeah So as you guys continue
pressing forward on this path
 The rocks destroy you
 So the horses moving forward at a
 All right so make an animal handling check
because youre now going into a straight just go for it
 Yep
 Without issue you horse speaker Caduceus
Clay give them the intent to go into a gallop and
they begin picking up loudly and you hear the
kind of soft neighing as they begin galloping
forward the cart taking up speed At which point
you hear a voice behind go Hey wait a minute
 And you see as the one with Calm Emotions
begins charging forward Is it a saving throw on
Fear every turn
 Its concentration
 Right So it fails the first one Succeeds
on the second one So itll be three rounds in it
gains it back which is just about the time it
would take for the Calm Emotions to fade at this
point So at this point as you guys are running
forward at a doublespeed here moving forward
Horse speed pulling the cart though its only
going to be about half of that actual horse speed here
 Okay So Beaus now charging alongside
there The rest of you are pushing forward kind
of going in that realm at which point this Ettin
comes charging around the corner there no longer
affected by the Calm Emotions and you can see the
other one is rushing up behind going You
stupid Were supposed to work together And the
one to the left goes like I told you we
shouldnt work with more than one And hes right
off to the side here beginning to give so I need
everyone to roll initiative now

 Oh wow And  theyre rolling
good initiative on their end All righty so  to 
  to 
 All righty And then we have
 All right  to ten
 Oh no
 Sorry Jester All right so Nott youre
up first Theyre now like  running
 They have a battleaxe in one hand thats
half made out of stone with a giant piece of
splintered tree wood thats been wrapped around it
with rope In the other hand they have this giant
club from another piece of what looked like a
dried and dead tree that still has bits of root
and chunks of rock jammed in the side of it and
they both  charging towards you
One heads looking at you and the others just
looking up at the air at a bird that flies
overhead It looks a little spooked scared
grunt So what are you doing
 The closest one to you because youre
technically in the back of the cart right here
 Yeah hed be about  feet from you
 As far as you know yeah They dont know
youre in the cart
 Fjords in there as well
 You are so it doesnt know youre there so
you have advantage so its just a single roll
 Ten misses It goes wide out of the side
and the head that was watching the bird goes
 and peers closer to the cart with an
untrusting eye its chin tilted to the side This
is a terrible look now You see these very bulbous
faces that are a combination of muscle and fat
pushing into the eye sockets They have these
tiny beady giant eyes You see these roundish
pushedin pug noses and this large gaping jaw
ogrelike with two big tusks that protrude from
underneath Long scraggly dark beards that pour
down the sides of their face and over the front of
their chest mingling with matted bits of chest
hair over this tanned and sunweathered flesh
uncovered made of sheer muscle and anger You can
see each head has its own series of scars and
weird personality and as theyre running theyre
still arguing with each other as theyre in the
process of getting to you We need to go from the
side No Direct attack On this end the other
That the end of your turn Nott
 
 That hits the guy over here yes
 Yeah he still hasnt quite seen you
 It shot out there but hes not quite sure
whats going on Theyre not very intelligent
creatures you get the idea
  points of damage Nice As theyre
running the bolt lets loose and goes right into
the lower jaw of the one on the left the one that
was being referred to as Bodak
 Budak
 As it hits goes  and starts
reaching up with the hand thats holding the club
to try and pull the bolt out while the other head
keeps charging forward That end your turn Nott
 All right Beau youre up
 The horses move at initiative count 
 Just for ease of maintaining it
 Which is right after Caleb and Caduceus I
believe right What did you roll for initiative
  So its right above you Its before you
guys
 So its before Caleb sorry So after your
turn the horses will move Beau
 What do you do
 Possibly
 Your movements  feet
 Yeah you can definitely get to this guy
 The carts moving regardless What are you
doing
 Right here
 Oh There
 Patient Defense or dodge action
 No Its holding your action holding would
be doing that and bonus action
 You can do that
 All right bonus action Patient Defense
 Okay so youre readying an attack for when
one of them gets close enough to hit
 You got it All right that ends Beaus
turn The horses now move
 All righty That brings us to Caleb
 Yeah
 It does
 Has its own narrative with the death of the
minis
 All righty
 Oh snap
 Wheres the mini
 I painted it but Im trying to remember
with the move where it got put
 I know Im so angry
 Its been a couple hours
 Oh yeah from the jewels Yeah its been a
few days from that
 Fuck this would be the time to unveil it
but nevertheless here we are with the chaos of
the past few weeks of moving Next time Theres
big Beau taking up all that space All right and
for the remainder of your movement Caleb
 You can get up against the cart but not
into it
 That ends your go Caduceus
 Oh thats your Channel Divinity
 Yes Whats the range on it
 Yeah youd have to get closer
 Okay against which one
 All right left one over here you mean
 All right that is a natural  wisdom
save
 Dex save Oh thats a  Still makes it
though So no effect unfortunately It sees it
coming and ducks out of the way and the burst of
divine energy explodes in the middle of the air
to no effect Thats your action
 Okay Its now their turn The two ettins
rolled a  and a  initiative This one here is
going to go ahead and just run past Its going to
go over on this end thats 
  and then dash 
 So much better
 I love it Now thats Swoleregard right
there I worked so hard to paint it and then it
never came up and the moment it did I was so
sad Thank you Max
 This guy is going to go ahead and just go
back and forth on this That one over there makes
no action but its coming right up to the cart
and it has both of its weapons out All right
 Yes you can You get two attacks
 Ten does not hit Ducks out of the way
 What was that
 Okay so now you do actually make impact
and your fist hits the stomach and it hits what
feels like solid stone with a layer of blubber as
you watch it kind of ripple around the tummy One
head goes  and the other goes
 and they both focus on you
 And then both heads go Hmm and look
momentarily insecure before they go No we
dont and theyre going to take two strikes at
you with disadvantage because of your Patient
Defense
 That is a  to hit which does not hit your
AC The other strike does not hit thats a  to
hit So you just deflect them out of the way
Stop moving lady bigger lady is what you hear
while you hear  That ends their go
Fjord youre up
 Its like right above you You look up on
it it doesnt see you It hasnt focused on
anyone in the cart
 Yeah And its looking right down at Caleb
One heads looking at Caleb and the other ones
looking at Caduceus and both weapons are raising
up one for each of them What are you doing
  hits Theyre big They dont have a lot
of armor
 Both hit go ahead and roll damage
  total
 Yes you may So as you reach out slashing
sound the blade emerging out of the weird
illusion and you can see him look confused Leans
forward and the head peaks past the point of
illusion to see all of you in the cart

 As its head which is the size of your body
leans forward and grins the horrible stench of
its terrible breath pour in you instinctually let
loose the curse and you watch as the shadows leap
up into its face And it backs up a bit and the
shadows now have coalesced around the corners of
its jaw and the inside of its muscular and flabby
torso The curse has taken a hold
 Sure that ends your turn Fjord Jester
youre up
 All righty Where are you putting it
 Theres another Crittermade gift here
 Its another of the floating lollipop Go
ahead and make an attack with it
 That hits Go ahead and roll your damage on
that
 Five points of damage with the Spiritual
Weapon  on the back of the shoulders and
you still have your action to do a cantrip
 Thats two spells in the same round
 You can do a cantrip
 Okay thats a what save
 Wisdom That is a nine He does not succeed
so go ahead and roll damage on that
  points of damage So after getting
slammed in the back of the head on the left side
 They both  and you watch as dark
brackish blood pour out of the ears of each head
as they rear back from the impact That end your
turn
 So Jester leaves the cart and then join the
horses there
  So youre now you might want to
be there So youre not going to be trampled by
them I know That ends your turn Back up to the
top of the round Nott youre up
 Beau youre on deck
 No he just looked in and saw you Even
though youre hidden in the illusion its aware
of your presence and your basic location
 Fjord is engaged Technically so are you
 If you manage to hit
 You dont suffer ranged in melee
 Yeah that hits That hits
  to hit or  damage
 Yeah that does it All right cool As its
pulled back the impact of the bells its almost
reaching up instinctually though its holding
weapons it cant really plug its ears so it kind
of uninstinctually bashes into each head a little
with its own fist And as it pulls back you see
that one little exposed bit of the throat on the
one on the right and you release it and it
 that horrible sucking sound as its
jammed into its trachea Its 
and the other heads like  which you
hear as Stop complaining So thats your action
 That ends your turn
 Beau youre up
 Caleb youre on deck
 Go for it Roll first attack
  hits
 All righty
 Eight points of damage and its a
constitution saving throw
 That is an eight he does not succeed He is
stunned You can grab one head and then with the
other head grab the other and pull them down
like slapping two heads together in The Three
Stooges thing but into your knee They both
 and one of them like drops the club on
one side and its hand reaches up to try and grab
the face and its just all sorts of
discombobulated So continue your round You have
advantage on your attacks now
 Dont forget to roll your extra d for
damage because youre big
 Nine better than eight All right
 Okay
 Yes so youre using an action to try and
shove
 Natural two
 Natural two Even then hes stunned so he
would have it doesnt say anything about
athletics or trying to escape it Yeah it doesnt
matter Hes down So you trip the legs out from
under him with like a low sweep and a shove
 onto the ground weapons clattering to the
middle of the ravine to each side of it
   you get right there
 Go for it
 So glad we got to use big Beau
 Yeah thatll hit
 There you go
 So as you rush up the first one slams
against the jaw of the left head like slowmo jaw
spinning The other one you go to strike the
other head and this one the actual hand thats
holding the battleaxe drops the battleaxe to
catch your large fist in its hand and lean over
So one head is pulled back and another head peeks
around the other head goin
 Theres nothing that says you cant You
would have to spend more ki points to try though
 Okay
 You can but you werent aware of it So we
can try
 That is a  Thats a natural  plus
three It has a pretty good constitution modifier
So it does resist the Stunning Strike but good
try That ends Beaus go Caleb youre up and
then Caduceus
 This way over here
 All right it is not stunned it does get a
reaction So as youre pulling back it swings
high with its club as its currently dropped the
battleaxe Thats going to be a natural  plus
eight That is a  to hit
 All right
  points of piercing damage as this club
swings over with its jagged rocks and bits of
stone and root
 No hes swung back and
 You do yes
 Yeah monks with Sentinel Theyre nasty
 Nine points of damage nice With this one
you crack again The hit slams into Calebs back
sending him flying and shoulderrolling sliding
onto the ground and barely getting back up
knocked a bit for a loop from the impact You
dont notice that as you see the swing hit Caleb
instinctually you slam your elbow right into the
ribcage You hear multiple cracks as you get a
good solid six or seven inches into the torso with
your elbow as you shatter parts of the ribcage
there  This guys looking pretty
rough
 No its at disadvantage because hes
prone
 Ten misses
 That hits
 Two hit Go ahead and roll d
  points of fire damage As one of them
fires off to the side and hits a stone
 sending bits of rock and dust off to
the side the two other ones slam into the sides
of the ettin whos currently trying to find its
way up but it has no ability to move its muscles
its body still tense from the Stunning Strike
which actually would have given him advantage on
the attack because hes stunned
 Yeah I forgot that so roll one more roll
for the first one
 First one still misses There you go As the
flames burn and begin to ignite elements or at
least singe bits of the furs and leathers that
wrap around its midsection its still desperately
trying to get back to its feet That ends your go
Caduceus youre up
 Caduceus from the back of the cart riding
it slams his staff into the top of the cart and
beetles begin to swarm out of the staff theyve
been living on the inside and then fluttering
buzzing scooting over and begin swarming and
biting and attacking the side of the ettin as its
currently being consumed by the shadow and
everything around it Go ahead and roll an attack
for the
 Should be in the staff
 Thats unfortunate Here Ill find it
 Swarm of Beetles Go ahead and roll a bite
attack Its a d plus three
 Ten total That misses The beetles are
climbing up the side of its body but theyre
unable to penetrate the thick giantkin skin It
doesnt seem to mind so much as they havent been
able to get into any sort of sensitive tissue but
you can see this dark cluster as the beetles are
beginning to form up the right side of its body
 Oh All righty
 So the three creatures in range  feet
yeah its only going to hit the one guy
 Charisma saving throw Natural  minus
one
 I know Im sorry It succeeds
 You did Oh you avoided this this ambush
could have been a lot more harrowing
 They were going to do some actual carnage
 That ends your turn Caduceus
 Now its their oh actually and the
horses are trying to push forward
 All right This guy is no longer stunned Oh
no hes stunned until the end of your turn I
remember that So hes still stunned he cant do
anything
 No hes just on the ground stunned prone
and like 
 The other guy is going to go ahead and
move
 No they do not Hes going to move
forward
 So youre going to use a ki point to buy an
extra reaction Make an attack
 Thats one of the abilities of the class
yeah
  hits go ahead and roll damage
 He doesnt get to move past the melee range
He gets caught there from the Sentinel feat
Sentinel and this class in particular is a really
good synergy Do you want to make a monk tank
 Nine damage How do you want to do this

 Onto the ground both faces  into
the stone and rock below you
 Thats it

 He hits and he stops moving and youre
like Why is Like how bad was it You kick
the body over a little bit with your large Beau
form pull it back and there is a cluster of
sharpened stones in the ground that both faces
fell onto and pierced into the skull Theres a
trail of crimson coming out of the gap
 End of Beaus turn that guys no longer
stunned All right That brings us to Fjord
 Well no Beaus reaction That was the
ettins turn One of them got unstunned and the
Im sorry it wasnt Beaus turn so its still
stunned actually Thats right
 All right go for it Thats just a straight
roll
  hits
  just hits
  points of damage Its like  and
the other face is like  which you
recognize as being Suck it up

 Does that end your turn Fjord
 Fjords staying inside Jester youre up
 Thats as close as it gets
 It hit one guy though
 Yes you are
  All right Go ahead and roll its
a straight attack roll thanks to him being
stunned and prone so they cancel out the
advantage and disadvantage
 Thats okay
 All right roll some damage
 That was five yeah
  points of damage Nice Jester pulls
back clutching the symbol of the Traveler around
her neck
 On your waist sorry You pull it up from
the waist and 
release the Guiding Bolt As it shoots out as a
singular beam you watch as it swells with energy
and intensity and slams into him It actually
pushes him back five feet

 There you can see from the impact the
energy seems to expand and then contract to it
and you can now see the sparkles as now Guiding
Bolt gives advantage to the next attack against it
 And any movement
 All right Hop back up on the cart
 Top of the round Nott youre up
 Hes big enough to still be in the
battlefield
 Theres not a corpse to hide into but
theres a wound that you can
 Okay gotcha That ends Notts turn Beau
youre up
 Roll a stealth check
 Got it Beau your turn Caleb youre up
next with Caduceus on deck
 Whats the range on that
 Yeah Is that the minimum range Whats the
full range
 Its not a very long range on them
 Its  so foot long range
 With disadvantage Its stunned which is
advantage and its prone so its disadvantage
But Guiding Bolt so its advantage So its just
a regular roll
 Okay 
 Caleb youre up
 Oh shit Its the first Fireball of the
campaign
 Oh that was the end of Beaus turn youre
right
 Yeah that consumes him He has
disadvantage
 No prone doesnt give any changes to
dexterity Thats a natural five minus one for his
dex save
 So d fire damage to him
 Caleb sends out this tiny bead of red
energy quietly streaks over and then 
detonates this loud explosion that rocks the
center of the ravine It echoes out through the
mountainous area  As the
flames die down you can see the ettin on the
ground  Its outside is now charred and
burnt It looks very hurt
 You did
 I believe you did That ends Calebs go
Caduceus youre up
 Him No you are not You are more than that
away
 No he wont Even at his full foot
movement hell be just beyond the foot range
 Okay They slow down
 They do They begin to consume the eyes and
the ears and whatever immediately soft available
flesh is there the beetles begin to dine on it
 That ends your turn It is now the ettins
turn The ettin 
 Okay so youve moved over to this position
there
 Where Jester is at this little stone
 The ettin gets up and sees the beetles
eating his ally One head goes  the
other goes  Lets see Nope They go
 pick up one weapon pick up the other
and just bolt away Just book it out of here
Selfpreservation has kicked in
 It just starts running away That is an 
minus one does not make its next dexterity save
Its running up the mountains and like 
looking over its shoulder like Mmm 
 How do you want to do this
 You watch as It laughs and laughs and in

 Like one of those cartoons like distant
explosion fwoosh Yeah the wind blows past you
guys Make a wisdom saving throw
 Ten So as youre all like That was
incredible you look back and Calebs still
standing there hands extended
 Yeah youre still concentrating on the
spell Unless you choose otherwise
 Actually hold on Does stun break
concentration I imagine it would
 Yeah So Beau you go pick up Caleb As you
do your form shrinks down
 But hes a wispy fellow you  over
your shoulder firemans carry
 You could probably still curl Nott while
holding Caleb Youre pretty strong
 All right you walk over and cast Decompose
The beetles have made rather quick work of all of
the eyes and elements of softer flesh and as you
cast Decompose the body softens a bit and the
gaps in the back where the rigid structure had
left air between itself and the ground come to
close as the body sloughs a bit off of its
tightened structure You watch quickly as where it
normally was very rocky terrain bits of green
parts of its dead form and within bits of the
wounds that you guys had left in it from your
various hacks and attacks against its body you
see bits of reddish fungus begin to pop out and
fill the various wounds Nothing too intense it
begins the process
 Make an investigation check
  You loot through his body
 You find eight gold pieces  silver
pieces and half of an eaten goat that was
dangling from the back of its belt
 Well its great when its fresh You can
smell the week of ripening that this halfgoat has
been through
 The beetles eventually recoil back into the
staff So you guys gather yourselves back up into
the cart keeping a very close eye on the rest of
the walls of this gorge as you continue your
journey You push beyond this brief encounter So
its about four and a half days of travel to Nicodranas
 From here
 Youre traveling a long way man
 It took about a minute
 You guys rush up and hop into the cart
continuing your journey For this next day or so
Caduceus make a perception check for me please
 With advantage with Jesters aid yes
 All righty Keeping an eye out you peruse
the interior of the gorge for the remainder of its
length Eventually the mountain gives way towards
the end of your days journey You dont notice
anything waiting in the wings on par with what you
had seen before There are some mountain wolves
that wander down in a pack that notice your
presence but dont seem to bother They tend to
avoid the main road at this point Eventually you
make your way past the dry rocky plains just as
the sun begins to set You can see to the left of
you the Ashkeeper Peaks that continue to curl off
to the horizon the hills growing taller and more
scattered across the plain in front of you to
where you cant see beyond the first set But the
landscape seems to be dipping a bit beyond that
so each hill itself marks the horizon ahead of you
for however long you have to travel First night
rest as you were keeping watch no major issue
As the morning comes to you all begin to wake up
to the sound of approaching hoofprints
 Easy enough As you guys come to and wake
up off the side of the main path you glance over
to the right and you can see from the sound of
hoof prints two carts  or  feet off the
side heading up the road At the front you see
a I wouldnt say cloaked but hooded man with a
head wrap that falls into a scarf over one
shoulder a long grayandgold set of comfortable
travel robes sat at the front whos looking over
in your direction In the back of the cart you
see numerous sizes of metallic cages of some
kind
 Make a perception check
  No people You do see a number of
creatures little animals
 At this distance you can see a number of
small feathered winged creatures on perches on
the inside of one cage You can see on the back
cart just from this distance you cant make out
too much from this but you can see two small
furred creatures that are both circling each other
in the cage in the back
 Hes moving Just glancing over and
noticing this weird green dome off to the side
 Do you emerge from the dome
 Good morning
 Yes
 They are very nice they are very young
and they are ripe for finding someone who would
wish to give them the attention and training they
deserve
 No but you may look to purchase if youre
interested
 You all begin to walk over As you all begin
to approach hes like Whoa pulls on the
reins and the horses come to a stop You look
and its one man This gentleman as you approach
hes heavierset with very tan sunweathered
skin the folds of his neck just barely peering
past the wrap over his neck but he seems
relatively positive and jolly when you approach
Hes got this smile and his eyes are very
welcoming There are two other figures that are
walking alongside the cart that appear to be
keepers that are just keeping an eye on the
creatures You can see there are a number of small
bags and things that contain food and general
means of keeping these animals And as you
approach and look these animals are kept in
fairly good conditions theyre not they dont
look abused or anything theyre just being
brought He as theyre stopping the horses steps
off pulls back the wrap from his head and its a
smooth bald head with a little bit of stubble
coming in around the sides You can see hes
mostly gone bald on the top He smiles Well it
is a pleasure to make your acquaintance I am
Kestiff Drudy I am a handler of creatures of
fantastical possible talent and we travel along
these routes to find homes for these majestic
creatures If you are looking to purchase we can
give you a quick view of our wares
 Kestiff Drudy
 Oh well I had previously been traveling
from Port Damali and making our way from port town
to port town We had just left from Nicodranas
and are making our way upwards hopefully to
Rexxentrum with the various creatures we have
 Why would they block it
 I heard about that but do they not want
commerce
 We are carrying nothing illegal We have
been very particular to make sure the creatures we
bring across are within the legalities of the
Empire Should not be a problem but appreciate
the warning
 Well and giving a display the two other
helpers begin opening one cage in the far back
and you can see the two creatures they pull on the
side as they walk over with two very young tiger cubs
 Orange and white with black stripes across
their back These are twin cubs The last of
their litter to be given birth to naught but
about six weeks before
 If you would like to make a home for either
of these they are  gold apiece Or if you want
to buy them as a pair merely  gold
 But of course Here Takes one cub and
hands it to you And they look like they had woken
up not long before and theyre like tiny
growling Big paws that are kind of oversized for
their physicality Hands the other one over to
you and as he hands the other one over this one
is kind of climbing up your shoulder gets a
little rambunctious and is across the back and
shoulder area
 They look very happy with you Im not
going to lie
 We have Jamyela who is in need of a home
and some care And he points over to another
cage and you can see an older baboon You can see
the orangishred fur fading to gray It looks
older You can see the drooping skin It has one
arm up holding onto a branch in the cage and
looks over and its like
 

 He goes Well she is unique Maybe a
bit of a big personality but overall very useful and
  gold for her
 We have and he turns
 And you can see two of the helpers have gone
into one of the larger cages and pulled out these
leather cords they keep wrapped around a finger
with these little loops that are affixed to the
legs of these three smaller kind of parrotlike
birds This is a blue dollop and sets it over
onto the edge there
 On the horn This is a purplefeathered
joppie and hands it over to you This is a
yellowwhite kurat and the third bird is placed
over onto your other hand These run about 
No these are  gold pieces apiece for these
birds
 He takes the cubs from you and puts them
back in the cage We also have and points over
to an owl
 You see an owl a large owl in one of the
far back cages that is kind of like curled up You
can see in the daylight its now hitting the end
of its conscious cycle The head  and
just stays in the cage The owl is  gold
pieces You hear this  from the back
cage and you can see this vibrant green peacock
that is in one of the further back carts
 Thank you
 You see it kind of sitting in the cage
 Yeah theyre dicks Its sitting there in
the cage The peacock will run you  gold pieces
to purchase We have in that cage over there
And you see this long branch twisted up the side
Eh hes not awa Come on show yourself He
takes a little stick out of the side and pokes the
log You see  up on the log this tiny
This is a crimson weasel
 This is  gold pieces for the crimson
weasel
 They go ahead and take the bird off of your
horn and begin to retrieve the other birds off of
Beau and take them back to the cage
 He goes over and opens the owl cage gets a
heavy leather glove on
 Gets a heavy leather glove on and then
reaches in to get the owl and it takes about
three or four minutes to eventually nudge it to
get onto the arm and the owl is just fucking not
having any of it and is like  No
 There is a reason we keep them in separate
cages yes
 That is up to you I cannot guarantee
success in this endeavor but you are welcome to
try Being a natural predator of the crimson
weasel I would not recommend it But it is your purchase
 Brings the weasel over There is a leather
leash on the weasel hands it over to you The
weasel climbs up your arm Immediately it hits
either Its definitely Definitely a smell of
of creature is the best way I can describe it
 Yeah Its almost citrusy but like
fermented citrus
 Similar to a ferret smell kind of It makes
its way up the arm and curls up and nestles into
you Its pretty soft
 We have one more This er this is a
trained creature because we have to train them
initially or we cannot keep it with us He turns
around and pulls out the side a tiny little puppy
Its like a soft kind of brown puppy with a bit
of full
 He goes This one is  gold pieces
 Well it is trained to stay within its
cage Because when it gets excited and he pulls
it over towards you and the tail kind of wags and
then it  vanishes from his hand and then
 appears on the ground next to you
 Appears on the ground next to you and is
like Arf Arf arf and kind of curls up and
starts nibbling on your boot
 It is  gold pieces
 No The dog is too the dog will get
larger I will warn you It gets to
 Probably not unless it
 The crimson weasel is  gold pieces The
blink puppy is  gold pieces
 Thats a very good question
 You know exactly why Because its funny

 Yeah make a nature check
  Looking over all of them all the
animals are wellkept
 Yeah Oh you asked them
 We are very particular to make sure the
creatures are wellkept and comfortable wellfed
and are of the utmost quality of presentation
These are not
 Oh you were talking to the animals Im
sorry
 The best that you can make out from them
they
 No theyre enjoying the fresh air
 And the attention Mostly The owl doesnt
want to fucking deal with any of you
 Yeah
 No he didnt give you the glove
 Yeah Well you have your bracers
 Make an animal handling check
 Thats cocked Yeah roll again
 
 You go to pet it and as your hand gets
close it rears back and opens its beak a bit and
you pet it and the eyes squint very tightly and
then eventually its
 The feathers furl up a little bit and it
tends to poof It seems like its enjoying it
begrudgingly like its really trying not to but
its like oh this does feel good
 If you are not interested please let us
know We do have travel to get
 Weasel Owl All right
  gold pieces from each of you
 All right That is  gold total
 Thats  gold each  gold each
 No wait hold on  So its 
so it is  gold each
 Yeah
 Yeah I did All right so Jester has a
crimson weasel
 Whatever you want to call him
 Hed be more akin visually to a great horned
owl except for because it comes from a more
temperate region here on the Menagerie coast the
feathers are more lithe The body is less large
and its more elongated and thin and the tail
feathers are a little longer and the beak itself
has a very very sharp like more than usual
sharp
 You watch as he pulls up and goes

 All right so thats  gold away And Im
going to warn you
 this puppy is rambunctious and As hes
making the transaction Hes not going to tell you
after the fact like a tool You must be diligent
and begin to train it to know who is home Or else
you lose it
 So begin training it now
 Nugget the blink dog All right so mark
that somewhere You have your crimson weasel you
have your owl
 There is no rush Thank you very much for
your commerce If there is no other purchases we
will continue our journey northward
 All right you as well tall friend
 All right Put it up Everyone gets back
into the carts puts the rest of the creatures
away
 The carts roll to a stop and  one
of the hands comes over and this younger woman
the one whos been helping with the birds comes
over with two small satchels One hands it to
you and it is filled with about ten driedout rat
corpses
 The other one is filled with what looks to
be bits of dried jerky and dried fruit
 For the dog andor the weasel based on what
you want to do The cart continues northward and
is out of your periphery
 Make an animal handling check on the blink
dog
  Okay
 It blinks out of your hand and you feel
this weight up in your horns
 You look over and see its slipping off of
her horn trying to hold on as its hind legs are
kicking up trying to get leverage
 
 All right as you guys
 Yep Yep

 Nothing in the valley coming to your
attention All right so as you guys gather your
supplies and continue southward along the road
for the sake of brevity well say for the next
few days you travel relatively uneventful
passing the odd traveler andor messenger riding
their way up or past you at a much faster speed
To your left you can see the massive green
jungle this tangled jungle forest to the east
that consumes the base of the Ashkeeper Peaks all
the way just out of sight to the horizon known as
the Cuarasca Jungle The fields and hills you
follow grow darker and more dense with greenery
The sky is more clear and a more vibrant blue than
youre used to in the northern lands and the grey
skies of the empire You follow the road over a
series of rising hills until you eventually crest
the tallest your eyes catching a beautiful and
for some of you an entirely new sight Beneath
the cloudless blue the horizon comes to meet an
endless stretch of deep cerulean scattered with
thousands of tiny sparkling lights the sunlight
dancing across the distant waves giving the
illusion of a million scattered diamonds glinting
across what is the Lucidian Ocean To your left
the dark green of the Cuarasca Jungle still
dominates the countryside along the Ashkeeper
Peaks the now hundreds of miles of lush tangled
vine canopy stretching to the shore and stopping
at the southern cliffs and beaches that give way
into the endless waters A warm breeze blows from
the south as the faint scent of salt water tickles
your nose Due just south of your hilltop
southwest the road continues to wind through the
green hills and patchwork rocky mounds dotted with
trees and overgrowth eventually leading to a
rather large city that sits on the coast Dozens
of boats large enough to see even at this distance
cluster around the bays and docks while the
colorful rooftops and towers vary in height and
design giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of
cultures having built this space without unified
vision To Fjord this is a familiar sight And to
Jester this is home Welcome to the Menagerie
Coast and the port city of Nicodranas And thats
where well finish tonights episode

 Nott now has a fullon ALF dynamic with some
of these creatures Im pretty excited about that
 That was fun Im excited to pick up in a
couple weeks guys
 I know Well be back for the main story and
the experience of the arrival in Nicodranas the
first week of September the first Thursday of

awesome Liam OBrien running a oneshot with these
three wonderful folks with Laura Travis and Sam
and two fantastic guests joining for that So
check that out next week on Thursday
 Next Wednesday right

I said no
 Anyway
 Yeah In your mouth
 It becomes part of your bloodstream at that
point Anyway guys have a wonderful week We
love you and is it Thursday yet Good night
 And welcome back That was good Oh boy
Last we left off The Mighty Nein had completed a
number of ventures within the Dwendalian Empire
since forming not but a few months before Their
friendship strengthened through victory and
through loss theyve decided after a few weeks
of downtime to take on the next route of their
journey Of all the different avenues that had
come to their attention it was decided to make
their way towards the Menagerie Coast to pursue
some threads that seem to tie into some of the
directions that Fjord would like to travel as
well as Jester returning to her home You bought
some supplies got your wagon prepared and made a
trip south through previous locations that you
first made your way up north through going to
Alfield and drinking with Bryce heading to
Trostenwald and paying off the rest of the debt
for the previous runner Gustav of the carnival
which had sparked this whole union of friends
Continuing southward past the Wuyun Gate had a
brief encounter with two ettins you managed to
make your way to the Menagerie Coast itself
seeing the gorgeous shores the eastern jungles
the waves in the distance and on the way
actually purchased some pets as well from a
traveling merchant caravan
 Mighty Nein as you close the final miles to
the outskirts of the northern side of Nicodranas
the first and one of the major port towns in the
Menagerie Coast what would you like to do
 Make an insight check
 You havent made it to the gates of the city
yet Youre probably about  or so minutes from
reaching the exterior of Nicodranas If you were
to head straight south as opposed to continuing
on the somewhat southwestern path towards the
city you would eventually hit the shoreline on
the eastern side of the city for about  
minutes or so to get there
 So heading southward deviating from the
path that leads directly into Nicodranas The
Mighty Nein makes their way southward towards the
shoreline The better part of an hour passes You
can see to the right the exterior walls of the
city and beyond the somewhat light gray to white
patterned walls They may have been gray at one
point but the white pattern you can see across
them seems to be layers and layers and years and
years of seagull excrement having gathered
stronger towards the southern side of the wall as
you pass near that section of the city
 Okay What do you look like
 Okay Human Jester
 Okay great Continuing on this way you
begin to see the seagulls now new birds for a lot
of you here You can see these white 
going overhead as they begin to cluster and hit
the shoreline You see a few of them diving
towards the water as you begin to look past the
edge of the rock into the sand bank You can see
eventually as your cart begins to make its way
towards the rougher bit of terrain before it
breaks at the ocean the actual waves now crashing
up against the shore and now pulling away Pushing
again
 Okay Yeah looking past the afternoon sun
at this vantage point especially you can see it
dancing across the distant horizon shore like
hundreds of little glistening flecks of glass The
shores sound itself is very soothing as you
approach and pull up your pants and take off your
boots to begin to step into the soft sand You can
see large rocks that occasionally break up the
beach itself that jut outward and on these you
can see small carvings You can see things that
have been drawn on them with chalk it looks like
that have been mostly washed away or eroded with
time As close as maybe  feet out you see a
small fishing ship that is on the outskirts of the
southern portion of the city Glancing off to the
right to where the city docks begin you can see
dozens of ships that are in the middle of the
harbor that are coming into the harbor many that
are in the process of being anchored and then set
up within the docks themselves This eastern side
you recognize as the Restless Wharf of the city
and you know the harbor is broken into two
different sides
 Make an investigation check
 You find a lot of really soft sand You
start putting it into piles and then you start
building a cool little mound and a wave comes and
destroys it and youre a little sad But thats
how life works
 Okay yeah Theres the
 The rocks are pretty disparate amongst the
shore here There is one section where you can see
a string of four rocks at different heights that
eventually get to about  or so feet out into the
shore before they disappear beneath the ocean
surface So before you even touch the water you
dive on up to one of the rocks and as you get to
the top your hands hit there and you can already
see the top of the rock is bleached white with
seagull shit But its dry Glancing over the
side you make a leap to the next one Make an
athletics check
 Yeah You can just walk right into it Its
an open beach right here
  You deftly leap from rock to rock until
eventually you get to the final one Its maybe
breaking about three or four feet out of the water
and youre perched on it and looking out in the
distance You can see the rolling waves coming in
you can see just like that yeah Its a
beautiful sight The sun maybe has a few more
hours before it begins to become full dusk and the
colors begin to shift in the sky But for you
having never seen the ocean for many of you its
serene its different its beautiful its warm
And Caduceus as you put your feet into the water
it is quite cool It isnt freezing its a
comfortable temperate temperature You feel the
sand grip and slowly dissipate between your toes
as you pull it in Its a really unique sensation
and you cant help but be excited by it
 Okay
 You watch as Caleb
 Caleb slowly submerges entirely into the
ocean
 Up to the neck or fully submerged
 Eventually you see Caleb vanish beneath the
ocean Theres a brief moment of worry as a few
seconds pass with no sight before you see 
buoyantly finding his way to the surface
 As you crouch down you notice the clothing
you place as Caleb begins to shift Moving slowly
to one side
 You pull it up and you see beneath it a
large sand crab that emerges from underneath it
looks up at you with two small black beads for
eyes and the claws 
 Make a dexterity check
  It rolled exactly an  on its
dexterity so you manage to just capture it Its
going to attempt to snipe at you Thats a  to
hit with the armor class
 Your thumb clamps down and theres an
immediate flash of pain through your body
 As youre trying to shake it off its still
whipping back and forth holding on tightly
 Okay Make an acrobatics check
 Ten Thankfully it rolled lower than you
It takes you a little bit of effort It takes you
two or three leaps because it keeps skittering
out of the way and youre not about to be bested
by a small crustacean For the third try you
manage to get just enough leverage as you push
into the air and with one resounding crack down
through its external shell it releases its grip
somewhat on your thumb You have to actually pry
it off It seems to be locked into its death grip
 Okay and over the next ten minutes or so
you watch as one seagull comes down eats and
grabs it  about  of them suddenly
descend as word gets out and youre surrounded by
white birds Well say for the sake of narrative
you manage to pick off about eight of them before
they end up scattering away from it You have this
beach riddled with dead seagulls with crossbow
bolts out of their bodies
 In the cart I believe
 if you guys are doing some training what
are you training him in
 Its going to take you a couple hours of
working with him here on the beach but you can do
that Make an animal handling check
 Okay utilizing bits of the feed and the
snacks that you had purchased off of the original
vendor with Sprinkle tucked up in your neck and
theyre focused on their various endeavors
Jesters tunnel vision focused on this adorable
little blink dog The fur is a light tan color
with bits of faintly darker brown stripes and a
hint of calico elements to its coat but very
faint along the back Oversized puppy paws that
look soft and goofy but the limbs themselves are a
little unnaturally angular for a natural dog You
can see some of its fey nature peeking through in
its features Its ears are very tall and pointed
though wide at the base As you start teaching it
to blink you watch as it prepares each time and
as it begins to figure out the commands and what
youre trying to guide the eyes begin to go from
a dark black to a bright blue right before it
blinks over here and the eyes fade from blue to
black as soon as it manages to find its next
location Over the next two hours or so of you
working with this you begin to eventually develop
the early stages of finding ways to command it to
teleport when you want it to although you cant
really guide where its going to teleport yet But
youve learned a command or a whistle of your
choice that will tell it to blink
 So you get to decide on that
 Did you name your owl
 What did you name your owl
 Do you meditate for the full two hours that
shes training the blink dog or do you return to
Professor Thaddeus in the cart
 Okay so you stand about  yards from the
cart and hold aloft your forearm and attempt to
find a way to coax Professor Thaddeus
 Roll an animal handling check
 Okay  Over the next hour and a half or
so you realize that your owl wont just come to you
You begin to find coaxing it with pieces of meat that
you scavenge from the remnants of the meal
 Youre waving the seagull it seems a bit
large but eventually in smaller pieces you begin
to realize you can coax it and you can get it to come
to you when you have a piece of food in your grasp
 Yeah Youve begun the process of forming a
bond with your animal
 Thaddeus seems to already have a stronger
bond with Caduceus than you
 While this chaos is happening with Caduceus
slowly wading through the shoreline Caleb floating
in the distance practically nude Nott
diminishing the population of the various
waterfowl and those two training
their pets what are you doing Fjord
 As the falchion emerges from whatever pocket
space it resides when not in use theres a splash
of ocean water across the ground flung from the
very faint bit of force that is released upon its
summoning As you hold it in your grasp and hold
it before you looking at it for a moment the
sunlight gleaming off the blade showing the
intricacies of its curvature of the falchion
Summers Dance mutation that has come from the
consuming of the blade not long ago It feels
cold same temperature of the ocean that youre
currently sitting in and as the temperature of
the ocean warms to your touch so does the
temperature of the blade youre holding
 Id say hes about  feet out Not too
far
 Yes you may Caleb as youve been lying
there looking up into the beautiful blue sky with
faint tufts of white drifting by but mostly this
unending sphere of blue color before you Fjord
just appears a shadow above you looming in the
water
 As a unique visual perspective here too as
Caleb is no longer just floating buoyant but who
has probably not had too much experience swimming
in the past is having to haphazardly thrash
 Its closer to  well say Enough to the
point where you can submerge and touch your feet
underneath but to stay above the water youre
talking as you thrash Fjord is gently buoyant occasionally
putting the hands in the water the armor itself
keeping you mostly aloft by its enchantment and
just being comfortable in the water its Fjord
looming over as youre keeping up with him best
you can
 As you guys are having this discussion you
watch as this beacon of pink hair emerges from the
water next to you
 As you continue talking the voice creeps
through and goes Jester I only received a
portion of what you were saying but I am singing
tonight Are you nearby
 This side of the coast it would be
because where you are on the ocean it would be
setting in the west
 You have multiple moons
 From the Menagerie Coast the sun does set
in the ocean
 As you guys gather your things dusk has set
in and now the sky shifts from light blue to a
deep blue and purple on the eastern side as the
oranges reds yellows and pinks begin to
overtake the western side of the skyline
 Are you heading back to the main road to
one of the entrances to the eastern gate of the
city Or are you heading towards the coastline to
the actual wharf itself
 Probably the wharf
 Okay You head along the coastline
eventually finding your way to where the wall
itself slowly diminishes in steps It does extend
out into the ocean there is no direct path where
you can walk along the shore and go into the city
It is specifically marked off There is an archway
there that is gated by two of the guards that run
the city
 Okay You do see about six zolezzo that are
currently guarding that entrance The rest of you
see armored guards varying from the scalemail and
the maroons and muted colors of the townsguard
youre used to seeing in the Empire Here the
zolezzo have a blue and green base but you can
see on the armor each individual zolezzo has
their own unique decoration and flair to it some
way of customizing it making it their own As
such even within their own ranks there is a sense
of color and individuality and their own armored
senses That doesnt mean theyre not still armed
and wondering who the fuck you are as you approach
the exterior of the city As your cart begins to
approach four of the six zolezzo immediately
raise their weapons and they begin to approach
Halt What is your business in Nicodranas
 The one at the front you can see beneath
his helmet which has these two bits of chainmail
that curl open like curtains on each side of his
face He pulls them out of the way and looks
forward towards the rest of the crew there You
can see his darker skin and his thick brow its
almost like a unibrow that sits over sundried
lips that are a bit cracked and parched He
glances forward looks over the rest of you and
goes The Ruby of the Sea
 Make a persuasion check
  Okay He goes All right and where do
you hail from
 Port Damali is from the other side but its
fine He goes All right Its roundabout And
you are
 Now make a deception check
 He looks back to the rest of the zolezzo
and they discuss for a moment for themselves and
he says Well I apologize but there is no entry
after dark on this side of the wharf regardless
If you want to enter you have to enter from the
main gates
 Well then youll have to find some way to
make it through the gate He holds his hand out
 You put five gold in his hand
 He shakes it in his palm Very well let
them in To the side they have a portcullis that
is held up by some sort of chain mechanism that is
beyond the wall They step aside and let you in
they usher you through quickly because nobodys
supposed to come through this entrance As they
all walk by you can see them all looking each of
you up and down taking a mental note of what you
have on you who you are what you look like as
well as what they perceive to be inside the cart
A few strange faces at the cluster of creatures
around Jester and the rather disinterested looking
owl thats clutching the forearm bracer of
Beauregard You pass through this archway on the
exterior wall and immediately look before you and
you can see the eastern side of the harbor here
what is known as the Restless Wharf Immediately
before you you can see a plethora of people that
are walking along this heavy dockside harbor
There are a number of warehouses and small huts
and buildings that are built both on the dock and
built along the side of where it adjusts from
stone and sand into wood and elements that turn
into the docks themselves You can see tall cranes
made of wood and cord and rope some of them ten
feet some of them  feet or so that are in
the process of either loading or offloading
various materials from the trade ships that are
making their way into harbor or loading up to
leave in the morning You see two or three larger
guild buildings that tend to be the hubs of
information for those that are coming from the
docks There are a few dockmasters that are
walking around who are in the process of taking
down information of who it is entering or exiting
with their ships making sure that everything is
being handled and you see a number of zolezzo
that are also keeping a close eye Torches are now
lit as the sky grows darker and theres one
thats going through the city and lighting the
actual oil lanterns that hang on these tall thin
poles that dot the city that have to be lit at
dusk One thing that does catch your eye is right
towards the center of this harbor where the
Restless Wharf would be transitioning into what
you know as the Open Quay which is the other half
of this harbor there is a massive lighthouse that
sits on this one bit of rock that protrudes where
the docks come to an end and an element of the
stone floor continues out before breaking off into
a shelf into the ocean below You can see this
beautiful lighthouse You know it as the Mothers
Lighthouse It catches your attention
specifically Caduceus because the beautiful
design of this lighthouse while it seems natural
and a gradual towerlike point on the back side
on the northern side the southern side that faces
the ocean has a foot relief of the upper torso
of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse
looking out over the ocean A beautiful sculpture
with wild hair that tangles and curls around the
shoulders and then merges in with the stonework of
this lighthouse but whats unique is the way the
lighthouse itself is placed as it rotates As the
light beacon comes across you watch as the eyes
of the woman flare up as the light passes that
side of the tower You recognize the closer you
get to this area this large sculpture is that of
the Wildmother of Melora That is where the
Mothers Lighthouse title comes from
 You guys are making your way through the
Restless Wharf and getting odd looks from the
side of various sailors and dockhands that are
curious as to who you are and how you made your
way here Are you heading directly to Okay
That being the case
 Yeah youve spent a bit of time here
 Its a little over   miles from here
Its quite a distance
 Yeah along the Menagerie Coast Port Damali
is the westernmost port city which is why its
the largest here Its the major hub of trade
between all the western bits of civilization
TalDorei Marquet Issylra with the port town
Nicodranas being the furthest east The two of
those mark the two endpoints the bookends of the
Menagerie Coast There are a few other port towns
in between but theyre smaller by comparison and
Nicodranas is about half the size of Port Damali
 Make a perception check
 Nine Everyone seems to be going about their
business You are drawing some attention from
folks as it is their job there are a few zolezzo
that keep an eye as you pass by You see one male
dwarf figure that appears to probably be the
Wharfmaster who has a number of people talking to
him who watches you pass by and as he does so he
scribbles something in a book and then goes about
his business but thats the most you notice You
pass beyond the Restless Wharf heading
northnorthwest into the city eventually the
hustle and bustle of the docks begin to fade the
warehouses begin to slowly diminish their
overtaking of the central business area of the
city and you come upon a large foot tall
stone archway Its a gradual arch as opposed to
being straight and then turning over its a slow
gradual arch there with a large gem embedded at
its peak at its zenith
 There are eleven of these throughout the
district
 These if you were to recount what
information of history you know about the city
here the Opal Archways once marked the goddamn
it
 There you go They once marked the exterior
of the original city I will fucking kill you
Never mind you dont get lore I can give and I
can take away No the Opal Archways mark what
were the original boundaries of the city when it
was first founded and the city has expanded far
beyond that but that now marks the richer most
lively district where a lot of the political
elite where a lot of diplomats and the wealthy
merchants come to either live andor spend their
money You pass beyond this archway the original
occasional set poles that hold the oil lanterns
that give the faint bit of flickering firelight
through these dark cobblestone streets give way to
much more vibrant magical baubles that hover
about ten feet above the air Theyve already been
set and you see them give off a brighter glow
and the colors seem to shift One of them has a
whiter color but then slowly turns to an orange
then shifts to a green About ten feet away on the
other side of the street you see another one
thats colors are shifting but in a different
pattern so theyre kind of complementing and also
contrasting each other At this point too you
begin to see the streets while not as crowded as
the wharf people that are here are much better
dressed You see a carriage make its way by to
your right and you see a few folks that appear to
be welldressed nobles of some kind wearing a
crushed silktype clothing that is bright blues
and purples and jewelry of all sorts of gems and
colors Compared to a lot of the drab decor that a
lot of the noble families wear in your experiences
up in the Empire the cultural mishmash that tends
to build here on the coast over time with so many
people coming from so many places it all has
built this mixing pot of styles and ideas and
selfexpression and it immediately is visible in
the people that live here You do notice
strangely that there are a few townsguard among
the zolezzo here
 Crownsguard Crownsguard of the Empire
 Correct
 They look like theyre keeping an eye out
and you two have had the experience here
Crownsguard do have a small presence here Because
Nicodranas is the closest to the Empire its also
the crossover point where the two entities the
Clovis Concord that oversees the Menagerie Coast
and the Dwendalian Empire make their laws and
agreements and all of their essential intent to
not attack undermine or destroy each other takes
place So while the laws of the Clovis Concord are
enforced here technically the Crownsguard can
enforce imperial law if they were to see anything
that does break imperial law However their
presence is much thinner than anywhere else in the
Empire and its more of a courtesy given to them
by the Concord to make them feel more comfortable
in the city that is closest here Thats largely
why this city here in Nicodranas is considered a
popular escape for those who want to get away
Its the Vegas of the Dwendalian Empire where
its close enough they can go travel to and still
enjoy a bit of comfort and some semblance of home
in places but its still different and alien and
unique enough to the point where it feels like a vacation
 Theyre more on duty though youre not sure
if its their own duty or if theyve been given
some sort of post specifically by whoevers paying
them But it catches the rest of you who arent
familiar with this sight a little offguard and
you immediately adjust your posture and get into a
little more of a naturally defensive position
knowing that there is now two forces of law
enforcement now looking to the streets of the
Archways
 In passing further through the Opal Archways
district you begin to hear the music of various
street buskers and performers beginning to take to
the roads They have their own lighting
arrangements and you see a small whats the
word for it A topped cart a vardo Thank you
 Well it would be on yours A vardo tucked
into one corner where there is a small group of
about four performers out there doing juggling
acts It reminds you of the early days when you
had first come across the carnival in Trostenwald
Most everyone in the street doesnt pay them mind
occasional silver is tossed their way Passing
that still you go by a building that catches your
attention immediately This gaudy nearly a palace
of an estate You see this large building white
silkdraped dull brass and orangeyellow stone a
sandstone base construct of a building You know
this Youve passed it before but youre
uncertain This is the Marquis Demesne This is
where the Marquis of the city lives
 Even at a glance you can see that theres
probably well over  rooms within this establishment
 It looks like a small compound with three
low towers four or five story towers two at the
front and one towards the back thats the taller
of the three All one singular building It looks
like a palace Small for a palace but too large
for a mansion Its that weird inbetween state
A lot of money has gone into its construction and
the closer you get to it you can see that maybe
its not in the best of upkeep But what you do
notice is that the presence of Zolezzo is very
strong Theres probably about  or more zolezzo
that are in the process of keeping an eye on the
vicinity walking around the boundaries of the
exterior of the Demesne You can see eight or so
that are stationed at the front and a few that
are walking along the upper parapets or high
walls keeping an eye down on the street
 Yeah It can vary but you get the sense
Make a history check actually
 You get the sense that theres probably a
handful of diplomats that are staying there as
guests and thats why the guard is a little more
heightened than normal
 As you curve around the bend of the exterior
of Demesne you see before you what is considered
the highend inn of the Opal Archways You see
this beautiful threestory thin but very tall
building of soft sky blue pigment thats been
painted across the stone and each windowsill you
can see this goldleafed wooden frame that
dangling from it is a deep cerulean crushed
velvet curtain that open up across glass windows
that appear to be stained glass and glowing from
the inside emanate this slightly shifting
kaleidoscope of color from the inside out The
steps that lead up to the front double doors
which are currently open emanate a very soft
apparently playing gentle atmospheric music to
the interior This is a very familiar sight to
you Jester as this is the Lavish Chateau This
is where you grew up This is your home
 You know Disguise Self lasts an hour
right
 Its been over an hour But Ill say that
youve kept it up but mark off two more stlevel
spell slots for the time its taken to travel
since you arrived at the ocean
 From traveling from the ocean to the city
and making your way through its been the better
part of an hour so it would be two spell slots
 Yeah a little over an hour since you left
the beach
 From what you recall they request weapons
be noted You can keep a weapon on your person
as a means of selfdefense but you cannot come in
fully decked out ready for armor You can have
one small personal item on yourself as a means of
selfdefense Everything else can be kept at a
coat room at the entrance You also do see two
zolezzo that are stationed on either side of the
open doorway that is part of the protective
presence here at the inn and the higherend
customers that they see
 Make an intelligence check
 He can adjust his height
 Thats part of the Disguise Self ability
that he has
 No its a racial trait of a firbolg
 Okay Youve taken a bit of time to study
the accouterments and fashion of those around you
in the city specifically those that appear to be
common denizens of Nicodranas As you emerge with
Caleb you see Caleb in this beautifully clean
wellpressed coat with a higher collar a wider
sleeve and with cuff You can see a bit of a
cravat poofing from beneath A very nice presence
And you see with the same pink hair how would
you like to be dressed
 All right So you almost look like one of
the ghosts from PacMan
 Okay perfect
 As you approach and begin to step out of the
cart you see a young human man in his early s
or so his hair gelled back but it tends to curl
up and poof a bit towards the base and around the
sides of his neck Hes wearing a vest with a
plain but wellmade silk white shirt and a pair of
trousers You recognize him as Tyral He is
essentially the front hand of the inn As he
approaches he looks up to you Are you leaving
your cart here Are you going to be staying
 All right Well I will see that this is
taken care of Please enter
 We can There is a charge
 Um Sets it on the railing of the stairway
on the side and goes Very well I will see and
tend to the horses and your hawk
 Ow Ow Ow
 This is actually to pay for the service
 He doesnt say How much do you give him
 Boarding the animals and taking care of the
cart
 All right You drop five gold in his hand
and his eyes go wide Hes like Oh of course
 Right this way
 He seems to be immediately swallowing the
pain from the talons that are grinding into his
forearm and is now smiling brightly and eager to
please the new arrivals on the outskirts
 As shes saying this a dark spot is slowly
spreading across
 It is a male
 It would be a Steven
 Your cart is taken care of one of your
animals has found a temporary companion You make
your way up the steps The zolezzo keep an eye out
and nod as you pass walking into the interior
The warm light and music embrace you as you step
within the Lavish Chateau The first thing you see
are four chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in
different corners of this very tall chamber about
 or so feet from floor to ceiling There are
rafters that align with a series of wide wooden
bars that hang from the right to left side and
the chandeliers that hang from them appear to be
made of a polished silver color and on them hang
about  or so candles per chandelier that are
giving off this gently flickering warm light that
trickles down into the main area You see two
bars one to the right and one to the left in the
far corners with each being tended to by one
bartender You see a few servants that are jogging
from table to table and ten or so tables Youre
used to the dark wood taverns and the dives in
various degrees All the tables here have fine
very highcount white cotton or a white dupioni
silk that is pulled across and around these
circular tables and across them a silver platter
that contains candles fresh fruit complimentary
slivers of cheese and crackers that are set out
there There arent a lot of people in here
Theres maybe nine patrons that are currently in
the tavern but those that are in here are very
well dressed Theyre clustered around three
different tables
 Dupioni silk Its a type of silk material
that has an interesting texture to it
 Ill show you at the break
 It looks a little rougher than just smooth
silk It has a bit of a texture to it and it
looks a little more natural
 There you go
 Exactly You see ten tables in the room
total
 Yes Though the clientele can shift based on
time As you enter and look around on the far end
there is a single staircase a wide tenfoot
staircase that ascends up towards the back wall
and then splits in two different sides into two
separate staircases that ascend to the second
level Along that you can see all the wood
painted in a faint gray or very light tan color
There is a carpeting that is draped over the
center about eightfoot wide down the staircase
that is a similar light blue color as the paint on
the exterior of the building
 On the exterior yes On the interior its
a light tan and medium wood tint with whites and
gold and silver
 As you guys have been standing in the middle
of the foyer area youre pushed ahead by another
group of about four individuals They look to be
merchants welldressed for the occasion and they
push passed Ah excuse me They go and find
another table and you get the sense that the room
probably is going to be filling up
 Your mom actually descends for her
performance so youd have to go upstairs
 Okay Just you
 All right So you guys all find a table
 Okay You guys all find a table You ascend
the stairs with the normal route youre used to
taking which is to the right of the stairs split
towards the second floor You can see on the brief
landing before it goes up to the second floor
there is another zolezzo guard whos stationed
there keeping an eye out He looks to you nods
You run up to the secondary floor where there are
a number of various rooms for the inn that are for
rent You head up the next flight of stairs As
they both meet in the center theres this second
flight that mirrors the bottom floor parallel on
the floor upward That one splits again on the top
floor and there as you get to the third and
final floor of the chateau on the left side there
are a number of inn doors but there is one
doorway that is made of a different wood grain
than the rest of them It was a gift from a very
interested suitor years ago and it has been
installed but it marks the chamber where the Ruby
of the Sea makes her home and for most of your
life until recently you made yours
 Okay You go up to the door
 You can hear muffled through the doorway a
little bit of practiced singing Some scales some
La la la la la You hear other voices talking
and theres some rustling moving through Someone
seems to stub a toe and goes Ow Were
trying And theres a few other people rushing
around in there
 Theres a pause and the door creaks open
You can see one of the servants who works within
with very short crimped dark hair who generally
helps prep your mother helps her get dressed and
helps get her prepared for the performance
Glances past Her name is actually let me look
it up Nadine She peeks through looking at you
Im terribly sorry what did you say
 Unfortunately she is going to be
performing shortly
 She is not
 You hear a voice from behind her go Im
sorry what From peeking over her shoulder as
your vision focuses into the chamber beyond low
lit beyond the series of candles that are set
around the single mirror You see the beautiful
red skin of your mother and the dark hair tumbled
past the shoulder as shes been wearing a mostly
laced up bodice as the other servant is in the
process of lacing and tying it Glances over her
shoulder and pushes past the edge of the chair
 You see her smile brightly her faintly
white glowing hint of yellowishgold tint to her
eyes brighten immediately and goes Well come
in Please close the door
 Nadine closes the door and goes Im very
confused by this Mistress but whatever you
require At which point the other one whos
lacing is still pulling on the back of the bodice
and without even looking at her Marion pushes her
aside Shh
 As you give her a hug she holds you there
and goes You look different
 Theres a nod and the tension in her body
melts as her arms close around your shoulders and
back and pulls you in close This moment of warmth
and relief that washes over both of you and being
reunited here in this chamber The two servants
sit in the back awkwardly not quite understanding
entirely either and whispering to each other
while Marion continues to hold you and rock you
back and forth My beautiful Jester I have
missed you so much
 I remember you telling me you telling me
you were going to go there
 How was it I have not traveled beyond the
boundaries
 Id be happy to
 She traces her fingers down your face
 She feels it Can I see my little girl
 Theyre fine You drop the illusion and
even though she knew it wasnt until she gets an
opportunity to look upon your face and your hair
and your eyes and your smile that you watch life
breathe in like a renewed fire into the chest of
your mother Immediately she grabs the sides of
your cheeks and pulls you in Ive missed you so
much Brings you in and kisses you on the
forehead and starts running her fingers through
your hair
 He is very adorable
 She immediately starts brushing your hair
with her fingers on the side Youve gone so far
and traveled so much You have to tell me about
what youve done
 Yes it is please Do not mind she knows
what to do Now in front of the mirror with you
behind her shes looking at you through the
mirror over her shoulder as youre helping
lace up the back of her bodice
 Shes enthralled listening to all this
I would never have thought my little Jester
would be seeing the world and fighting
creatures
 I want to see how strong youve gotten
 Perhaps wait until after the performance
Ive just applied my anyway At that point she
stands up and Nadine helps her put the rest of her
dress on Its this beautiful deep purple
satintype material Its lowcut with this
beautiful long training sleeve that hangs down
past her knees when her arms are at her side Puts
on her necklace a faint velvet choker that pulls
across the back of the neck there and in the
center is a small blue gem that she keeps to
remind herself of you She takes a moment to look
in the mirror Well how do I look
 Then perhaps you should go join your
friends
 Perhaps You can technically spend higher
spell slots to cast a lower level spell
 If you want to its up to you
 Okay
 Okay you run back downstairs join the rest
All right
 In the  or  minutes or so that Jesters
been gone the rest of the room has filled To the
point where there are a few people hovering around
your tables in hopes that perhaps you will leave
and they will try to snipe it from you
occasionally clear their throat in your presence
Hoping that maybe youll recognize their status as
higher
 They eventually make their way to the
opposite side of the room perpetually throwing
stinkeye in your direction
 You guys I believe took a table near the
stairs which would be on the right side
probably for a table that was available Looking
from the entrance you came so it would be on the
northeastern side of the building
 Its ten tables
 Yeah throughout the interior of this whole
chamber you probably have now including
yourselves close to  to  people
 That includes the people who are standing
because the tables have either been taken Some of
the tables here are set in reserve for people that
are only two folks that sit there and no one else
is allowed to take the table and it is enforced
They come with their own Zolezzo bodyguards
 Yeah there is a couple that is currently
situated on one of the central tables
 The first one you see is a human woman
probably in her early twenties or so very vibrant
blonde hair that is pulled back and left into
these curls that spiral down off the shoulders
Wearing a lowshoulder dress thats made of a very
fine you cant really make out the material but
it has a sheen to it Beautiful jewelry Across
the way you can see a much older man Receding
hairline a bit deep grayish turning white hair
very deep set crows feet in the sides of his face
where his eyes are almost not visible The eyelids
themselves seem to be almost drooping and the
wrinkles beneath are encroaching upon what little
of the eyes you can see Probably in his seventies
or so very well dressed with a coat and tails
Both their attire seems to be more Dwendalian than
Menagerie Coast At least in the styles that they
are wearing though they do have two Zolezzo that
are hired and keeping a watch at the table
 You do not
 Drinks have been ordered to your
specifications of the table and the drinks here
are expensive
 Okay Its rare that you get rounds here
you either get high end liquors or bottles of wine
 All right That will cost you
approximately
 Almost six gold For two bottles of wine
 Actually no Im sorry I read that wrong
For the liquor it would be six gold For the two
bottles of wine its ten gold apiece So  gold
total
 I dont know do you tip here
 The doors are closed on the other side of
the chamber The band brings their song to a
close A bit of a murmur takes the quiet room as
the lights shift The candles that were all that
warm yellowish orange light suddenly all at
once reduce to a low red flicker
 And thats where were going to take a
break

with the team Super proud of it theres some fun
bits in the book I hope you guysll enjoy You
have as of now one minute  seconds from being
able to get it So look for it ASAP
 The proper way to celebrate
 All right As youve all been sitting in
your seats enjoying your small table snacks the
chamber has closed the lights have shifted and
there is a bit of anticipation and tension in the
room As the musicians begin to slowly build up to
a new type of song that begins to fill the space
you hear the gentle footfall down the stairs
curving down from the right hand side to the
central staircase the beautiful visage of the
Ruby of the Sea in her dark dress the train
dangling up about six or seven steps behind her as
her fingers trace the sides of the railing She
comes down takes a breath and begins to gently
sing to the audience around you and you watch as
everyone in the room begins to lean forward
entranced the beautiful voice filling the
interior of this inn The lights seem to almost
flicker and shift with her emotional intent of the
song As her voice fills the space with warmth
the light seems to brighten ever so gently with
each crescendo Even the bartenders themselves
have stopped Though theyve seen performances
like this hundreds of times its still a
performance that draws attention from all across
the coast and beyond Jester youve seen this
many times as well but it doesnt ever lose its
luster You see as all the tables themselves are
quiet as she steps into the center of the room
walking from table to table tracing the edges
with her fingers making eye contact with each of
the patrons You see that older man and the
younger woman sitting at the table both sit
comfortably watching but cant help but smile in
the presence of this fantastic vocalist You see
at another table there is a rather burly looking
man who is well dressed though a bit rugged for
what hes wearing who is flanked by two dwarven
bodyguards and hes leaning in real intent on the
table towards her and as she steps by he touches
her hand and she touches it and pulls away a bit
and gives him a wink and continues singing He
pulls back into his chair resting You watch as
one of the other tables has these three merchants
that have been there since the moment you arrived
who seem to be eagerly counting out coins and
pushing them to the edge of the table to tip her
As she passes by she glances off to one of the
assistants who rushes over and scoops them off the
table She does not accept the tips herself
 Nevertheless for those of you who this is
your first time here within the Lavish Chateau
this is definitely one of the most beautiful
performance youve seen and you immediately see
why Jesters mother why The Ruby of the Sea or
at least one of the many reasons that shes
renowned across these lands As she completes the
piece she ascends back up the stairs back to her
chambers vanishing from sight As everyone within
stands up and begins clapping and cheering
 With that the doors open to the backside of
the inn Some folks begin to saunter out their
performance that theyve come to see for the
evening complete Others go back to their meal
and their drinks and their conversation Some
individuals begin to approach the bartenders and
eagerly ask for what you know to be the
availability for companionship that the Ruby has
for the evening
 You watch as the lights flicker and shift in
a similar way that they did with the performance
Some of the patrons stop and look towards the
stairs to see if shes coming back down again and
then 
 The heavy footfalls catch your ear as this
stomping sound start making their way down the
stairs You watch as a male figure comes down in a
huff One of the men that you saw watching the
performance earlier the more muscular fellow
Getting a better look at him now you can see he
has a rough tangled like a bowl cut that is a
bit unkempt at the shoulders A very wide neck
and once again hes well dressed but his
sunweathered skin and lack of social grace and
his physicality belies this weird space between
how he holds himself and how he dresses
Nevertheless he storms down the stairs his two
dwarven bodyguards leaving along with him They
end up exiting the inn
 As Nadine opens the room Actually your
mother and opens the door and your mom who has
taken the dress off and has currently put on a
comfortable robe turns and goes Jester I have
taken no suitors this evening so we can spend
it together
 Youve said you wanted me to meet your
friends I want to hear their stories and I need
to say thank you to those whove kept my little
girl safe
 Of course of course
 Well you are welcome to stay in your room
if you like I can definitely have rooms arranged
for all of you if you would prefer
 Whatever you prefer my dear
 Okay
 You guys head all upstairs and eventually
make your way to the third landing and the
chambers open and there Nadines waiting and
escorts you in Beautiful chambers with a large
canopy bed You can see silks in the windows that
have elements of gems and beads knitted into these
braided cords that you can imagine during the
daylight would add bits of colored speckles
throughout the chamber You see a balcony that
overlooks the entirety of the wharf below and also
know this to be the balcony where Jester got in
trouble But there you can see within this
 Exactly
 Im very confused by that exchange But
chairs are being brought up more food is being
brought up behind you Two more bottles of wine
have been fetched to your chamber and there robe
placed on most of the jewelry removed but still
fully made up and smiling as you enter you see
the beautiful redskinned Ruby of the Sea Her
dark hair now tied up behind and resting down the
back of her robe with a single curl that runs
in front of the face on the right side
Faintly white yellow gold eyes The horns that
curl backwards and then shift off to the sides
abruptly before curving back a little bit Its
this beautiful curl that extenuates the way her
hair falls behind It gives this wreath and a
crowned look to her This regal presentation even
when shes just wearing comfortable robes As you
all enter one by one she goes Please know that
you are guests of me here within this Call this
your home for as long as youd like to stay
 Well you would have to eventually pay but
you are welcome to stay for a while under my name
Please I would like to the know the names If you
would like to introduce
 I can see that
 Well I can see where she speaks honestly in
front of her mother as well She puts her hand out
 She pulls away but rests just a moment on
your finger tips before pulling away and smiles
I can see you are a very strongwilled and
protective man Do you watch over Jester
in my stead
 Good I feel better knowing that shes safe
in your care Anyway
 Right You mentioned that earlier Beau it
is a pleasure
 She reaches and shakes your hand
 The pleasure is mine as well
 Thank you and thank you You I can sense
a bit rough in the social graces so I am very
honored that you would come to see my performance
Is that a Zemnian accent
 It shows that youve traveled some distance
to be here I appreciate that
 Well youve found plenty of it here So
perhaps the fish has found a home
 Well I was not aware this was the dress of
a detective
 Yes you are
 Takes a step back Oh
 Dont apologize
 The world is made of all kinds
 They are the rats of the city I have had
plenty but I thank you
 Well I think you are very adorable It is
a pleasure to meet you Nott
 She grabs the edges of her robe and
countercurtsies halfway while shes sitting in her
chair And this one this
 Interesting
 The pleasure is mine Youve not been outside
of this graveyard that my daughter speaks of
 A man fresh to the world of vice I
presume
 Oh my daughter will break you of any
habits of ignorance very quickly
 Good
 You carry very interesting companions
 I did not
 That is incredible
 Well I am grateful that you all have kept
her safe Im excited to hear that youve been
able to do such incredible things Is this your
friend that you mentioned before The Traveler
 No but the healing
 Wow Oh very well Well that is
incredible
 Well I Here lets have some drinks
The servants begin to uncork the wine and
 To be honest That one She points to one
of the two bottles that were brought up As
opposed to the smooth wine bottle this has a
faceted gemtype crystal design to it The cork
itself has a deep crimson ribbon thats tied around
it Theres a little wax seal placed upon it
 Its a cantrip

  You begin to tell her tales
of the adventures youve had and recount how
youve met and you talk for a number of hours or
so Shes smiling and listening and engaging
While shes this beautiful matronly woman there
are moments when you can see that warmth and pride
creep through when she looks at Jester You can
also see that there is a very reserved and
controlled wisdom and intelligence to her Shes a
very perceptive woman that asks the right
questions at the right moments to throw you
offguard a bit and also get a bit of honesty
You begin to see how the quality of her
companionship comes from her insightfulness and
ability to bring comfort to any conversation
Though you had all these expectations and you
have your guard built up you cant help but
strangely feel welcome and open with a person that
youve just met You take a moment to think on
But youve all said so much about yourselves I
am afraid there has not been too much happening
here that is different Performances are great
There is two new songs that I have requested
written that should be completed by the end of the
year
 I cant wait to perform them for you
 Not with me He knows better than to go
after a wellconnected and mostly innocent figure
I have been working to try and get those charges
eliminated but it is a difficult process He is a
man who his pride is very important to him So
in time But for now perhaps just do more of what
youve been doing to not look like yourself once
you leave this space
  I mean yes But I would not
insinuate such a dark thing
 Well what has brought you here I mean
Im happy to have you but if you are just here to
see me perform then I
 Right
 Not directly but I may be able to ask
around
 I would perhaps She hands it back to
you
 Unfortunately no I have not come across an
Evantica
 There are many captains here in the port I
apologize but I know many
 I dont know an Ionos either You do
recall that Ionos is a member of the Jagentoth
family up in Shadycreek Run
 Yeah that was the connection with who that
letter was intended towards
 But continue to ask This is a vibrant
city and there are many people that come and go
Perhaps you could find somebody to help you
out there I will continue to ask around Im
being careful with my socialization these days
 Well Its no trouble I just
 Ive been having some problems with a
client
 Its fine Hes a very intense man who
relocated here from Fionen about two months ago
A burly fellow named Algar Dyomin
 Yes Kind of strange interesting taste in
presentation
 That is him yes He is very
 Dyomin DYOMIN  Hes
become very possessive He has been a client of
mine a number of times And while his conversation
was on the duller scale of individuals Ive been
with he paid well and did not seem to bring a
problem But he has become more and more
possessive and only in this past week Ive been
hearing of him threatening and telling other clients
of mine to back away I do not enjoy people
threatening my clientele or my business I have
twice now explained to him precisely the nature of
our arrangement and relationship That does not
seem to be enough for him Now the zolezzo of the
chateau are my guardians and theyre very good
about keeping watch I have my friends in the
Archways but the more I look into it I believe
Algar works directly for the Concord within the city
so he is with his own powerful allies as well
 This is my first time dealing with
scenarios like this but Id prefer to avoid any
sort of direct confrontation by any means
necessary any bloodshed within the Chateau 
 
 I appreciate your cleverness little Nott
However rumors travel quickly
 For some of them perhaps
 He has not broken the law His friends
in some places enforce the law That is where
my conundrum lies
 Honestly Im not certain what kind of work
he does though he often brags about his
importance as men are wont to do He does seem
rather wealthy and he bears enough respect
Perhaps the Wharfmaster may know more
 That would be helpful Though I dont mean
to brag but good luck
 Be careful how you dance around that
 Very much The old woman of the lighthouse
has been here for some time Could ask her perhaps
 Yes
 Yes the keeper of it The Lightkeeper
 Gladys I think
 No they only meet here It needs to be on
my terms it needs to be in my realm of safety
 No Hes also been braggadocious but not
forthcoming with personal information either
which is unfortunately a sign of perhaps
dubious andor dangerous business Hes told me
twice he wishes to one day show me his secret his
great servant beneath the city but
 I dont believe hes done anything that would
warrant anything too disastrous but if he can be
ensured that his presence is not welcome and
agrees that is the case that would be optimal
 There are many There is The Skew which
is where most of the riffraff and common folk live
but if youre looking for more social environs all
across the Restless Wharf There is the Open Quay
Those two places a lot of curious folk wander
and celebrate Fisticuff It is not uncommon
to find bodies in alleys
 Dyomin Algar ALGAR
 Please I do not mean to impose my
responsib
 Of course Im sorry it took a little
longer than anticipated
 As far as I know there is but one person there
I have not met them directly only heard of them
 Shes the Lightkeeper of the lighthouse I
know that she can be rather ornery so perhaps you
need to win over her interest
 She is a bit older in human years so be
respectful I guess
 I dont know I dont know what her
interests are but perhaps if you could find out
or at least not make her extremely angry
 I do not require compensation but if it
makes you feel better about it certainly Youre
quite the gentleman
 Yes I know of him
 Well I know of a man of you describe of
blueish skin and quite sweaty Yes he has come
through before
 He was very nice He was very dashing
 I told you about him before
 I dont know of the name The Gentleman
but
 Tell me more of this Gentleman please
 Well dressed smooth voice little patch of
dark hair on the chest right there
 Thats a very different place
 Yes The Evening Nip is the name of that
one
 I dont know about anything in that regard
but he wasnt named The Gentleman when I met him
 She smirks a bit and says Oh honey
 We had a bit of a romance years ago
 I told you about Babenon
 Babenon Dosal
 BAB
 BABENON
 Bob Loblaws Law Blog
 You say hes in Zadash now
 Thats what he told me
 Marion seems both present and not Shes
trying to process all of this She reaches over
and goes to her counter and begins drawing Shes
not anywhere as good an artist as her daughter
 Well yeah If youre going to draw a
picture Im going to draw one real fast too
 Not at this speed Im not no Im not
Shes not a good artist either so shes like
 You can make a connection
 I am so confused by this but youve talked
to him youve seen him you know where he is
 I cant leave
 Okay what do you say
 Okay so the spell sends No response
 Its late evening Its probably close to
midnight by now
 Oh my god
 Of course it does
 There is a palpable pause of nothing And
then he responds No thats preposterous
 Maybe it is
 I know a lot of people use the word
preposterous Its a fairly standard word
 Im sorry Maybe I just got a bit excited
My apologies
 Said he had to leave and take care of some
business on the sea I never saw him again
 Youre not wrong But though he may be
gone he left me with the greatest gift Ive ever
had so She runs her hands through your hair
once more For that Im thankful
 Love is a funny thing Theres still a part
of my heart that will always be his But its been
decades You move on
 That could mean literally two decades
 Regardless You can see shes flushed in
her face
 I will have rooms arranged I will send the
servants to get it taken care of You will have
the finest suites at the inn for the better part
of this week and longer if need be Just let me
know You can see shes a bit shaken by
everything but trying to put on the facade that
shes good Anyway it is a pleasure Thank you
for the companionship for the words for the
stories and for bringing me my little sapphire I
should probably sleep Good night
 Thank you thank you If you need
anything to be shown taught I have friends
who can help you
 Well
 I dont really go out to the bookstores I
have books brought to me but you may look around
There are a handful Im certain
 Good night And she pours her glass full
holds it and Sleep well And she kisses you on
the forehead
 Good night Jester Closes the door
 I dont think she seems okay
 Well thatd be more of a question for her
 Your rooms are arranged for you Theyre
Pillow Trovelevel presentation The interior is
warm and the beds are ostentatious
 Yeah From what you guys are used to
sleeping in you almost dont know what to do with
it once you lie in bed Its almost too
comfortable
 Roughly yeah Queen to king You all
managed to find yourself some rest for the
evening some more tense than others Some setting
up invisible threads The morning comes With the
light of the sunrise you open your windows and
look out over the ocean and the city below You
can smell the salty air The marine layer has
brought in a familiar gray sky to those of you who
grew up to the more northern regions of
Wildemount You can still hear the distant calls
and caws of the flying seagulls and ocean birds
You can see some of the higher buildings and
towers with their little perched clusters You
watch as a few dive down into the merchant
districts of the city and some distant echoing
yells as they shoot back up with a caught fish
that was supposed to be sold The ships are
already out and starting their day You can see
maybe  or so that are out in the main harbor and
scattering further to find their specific areas to
begin throwing their nets into the water The
morning is yours
 Actually the palacelike center here
 The Marquis is the head of the local chapter
of the Concord that looks over Nicodranas The
Concord itself is a loose union between all the
cities in the Menagerie Coast Theres a margrave
in each city that is the head of the city but then
works with the other margraves to interface and
make sure everythings good bad and business is
well That would be the center of Concord
influence here
 Okay Heading to the Wharfmaster is Fjord
and Beau
 All right Steven So you
 Okay
 Doesnt work The two of you make your way
back to the Restless Wharf Youre searching for
the Wharfmaster specifically Make an
investigation check
 And since Beaus helping you you can do
advantage on that one
 Okay Beau have you retrieved the
Professor or have you left it with the inn
 Okay You spend the better part of two hours
or so wandering up and down the wharf asking
questions before you eventually have somebody
point you over If you looking for the
Wharfmaster hes at the Wharf Load right there
and points over one of the larger center parts of
the dock that jettisons out into the harbor a good
hundred or so feet There is a central dock house
that is one of the buildings you saw when you
first entered where you saw a lot of the business
was bustling around although it is not as busy as
it was at dusk when you first entered the city
 But as you approach the building you open
the front door and someone is pushing past you
There are a handful of Zolezzo looking around but
it looks like entering the Wharf Load isnt a
notably guarded experience So as you enter there
is one Zolezzo across the way that is sitting in a
chair and looking out and chewing on some sort of
rough tobaccolike leaf in their jaw Across the
way you can see a couple of folks humans in
the process of filing out big leather books
ledgers and receipt books of various people
traveling through And you see in the back over a
table with a bunch of papers rolled out either
charting maps or large assembled lists of previous
excursions You see a male dwarf probably middle
to older age red hair that tends to eventually
expire into a deep gray at the end of this really
curly matted beard You see big gold thick
earrings that hoop from each earlobe the weight
of this heavy thick lobe has dragged the ears to
stretch a bit past the face The hairline comes in
a deep widows peak that recedes almost back to
the top of the head before coming in and there
you can see in a similar tangled tuft the rest
of his hair that coasts past his shoulders before
it exerts into a strange puff He is wearing a
simple leather tunic over a work uniform but
three or four fairly expensive necklaces or
amulets that clatter around as he moves You get
the sense of his placement by the other
individuals going up and asking him questions
hes probably the Wharfmaster
 He looks busy and there is a counter that
prevents you from traveling in without going
around it As you begin to make your way
around the counter one of the individuals up
there puts his hand out Whoa whoa whoa Can
I help you
 Ill see what I can do He takes the coins
and pockets them and walks behind and begins
whispering The dwarf puts his hand up for a
second and finishes making a couple measurements
and then Huh All right He jumps off his small
stool and comes over with heavy footsteps across
the wooden creaking floor now extending over the
wharf He approaches the edge of the counter
across from you and goes Right so youve
summoned me to you What can I do to help you
 Make a deception check
 Did you have advantage on that
 What was your first roll
 I dont know just double checking He
looks at you and goes Hold on a second
You see his gears turning and he goes through a
couple books Unfortunately by the records
records we have here Vandren and his ship was
lost at sea months ago
 I apologize
 Yes he comes and goes rather commonly
yes
 I honestly dont know where he lives But I
know where he works
 All right he works in the Sluice Weave
 The Sluice Weave SLUICE Sluice
Weave
 Sloose Sweef There you go
 If you are looking to sell you are welcome
to go to either Meandering Treasures here in the
Restless Wharf They tend to pay maybe not
top change but quickly As far as Dezima does
his business usually
 Dezima He is the proprietor of the
Meandering Treasures
 We have and he looks back to one of his
sheets of paper and pulls it out for a second and
looks at it We currently have eight dock spaces
not spoken for that are available for rent if
that is your interest Depending on the size of
the vessel of course
 No weve just had a lot of ships leave
recently There is a lot of movement in and out
 Make a persuasion check
 Hes like Ive seen him around Hes a
dubious sort of prick
 Fuck if I know to be honest He takes up
space Hes done some work at the docks here and
there but he rubs me the wrong way Probably
find him drinking at any of the dives
 If not drowned already
 There were some strange cats that came in
last night off the docks yes
 He starts giving you a curious look Youre
asking a lot of questions for a person Ive just met
 Of course Let me give you a very
prestigious piece of advice I think that will
ask so many questions
 Good day Then he turns back and clomps
back over to his table and is working but keeps
looking up expectantly waiting for you to leave
And kind of like
 So what are you guys doing
 At this point in time Id say its probably
a little past noon since the morning
 Okay So you guys heading there to meet with
the rest of the crew right The rest of you folks you
 make your way to the Mothers Lighthouse
During the day here and as you approach there
are a few fishermen that come up There are a
number of small wooden plates that are weathered
and dried and cracked in places theyve been left
out for a long time Theyll walk up and place dried
meat fish theyve caught sometimes somewhat
ripened and some rotting fruit that have been
placed there These appear to be offerings as a
subtle worship to the Wildmother You are
familiar with some of these practices though not
quite as crass usually in presentation but
it seems to work for travelers that wish for safe
exit from port
 You walk over to the door It is a
standard thick dark wooden door with a small
slot to look through that is currently closed
 You wait about a minute and theres no
response
 The louder one seems to echo a bit and
after another minute or so of waiting you hear
this faint creaking sound
 It gets louder and louder until eventually
the small door opens and you see this really
shriveled womans face These beady little dark
eyes peeking through and goes Can I help you
 I am
 Make a persuasion check With advantage
 She peeks in and looks at you And may the
grace of Melora bring us to talk and it closes
and you hear  It creaks open and for
as high as the slip was the womans heads about
two feet lower than where it was Theres a
stepping stool thats attached to the back
of the door as it opens up slightly and she
escorts you in slightly and the woman you see
If you can imagine a more burly after working
physically every day Estelle Getty A little wider
She has no sleeves on this long working dress
and leather apron or uniform that she wears
Her arms while the skin itself is sagging and
wrinkled there are some guns on this
old woman Her hair is a tuft of tightly curled
white hair No glasses just the beady little
dark eyes Where she smiles the wrinkles cause
this butterfly effect across the rest of her face
 Human yes So you invoked the Mother I
assume you are also a follower of hers
 I cannot say that I have my apologies
 Well Im happy that she could be a beacon
to you as shes been to so many who have
passed through Nicodranas
 Perhaps her guidance is going to be very
useful to you in seeking out a way to cleanse this
temple you speak of
 I cannot guarantee entry to the top at
least and peeks around behind to the rest of you
 Hello
 No
 I dont know if I can be of much help to
you I am but a simple mistress of the tower but
 I can tell you of its history Come in
 Sure
 Yep Kept trying to find the right audio
file and now this kept coming up real busy
 Its a really busy wharf guys Anyway Fuck
me for trying to add atmosphere right
 I know
 Its all good As she lets you all in with a bit
of a grimace she goes All right This is the lighthouse
 It is of the Mother Melora looks over
those ships at sea Keeps them safe
 Probably But the lighthouse mainly helps
the sea
 More or less
 I have been here for the entirety of my
life for now  years in Nicodranas
 Yes Thats how Ive gotten to this age and
still as spry as ever Starts walking up the
first set of stairs Come You should see the
view
 Every time you do it just adds more hit
points

 So here in this tower the Lady looks over
us Those who wish to have her guidance to prevent
dangerous storms at sea or the draw of the tide
to bring them to the depths are wise to leave for
her some gift before they traverse on their
journey You will see here is the viewing window
Tis not for sleeping and it is not the Mothers
boob
 You glance up and you can see now there is
a window thats set right about where the clavicle is
 Its a beautiful view of the entire harbor
especially this time of day when the suns at its
peak You see this beautiful set of ships out
there and fishing vessels and galleons and a
handful of different designs to each different
make from all over the world Theres one that
appears to be of Marquesian make You can even see
through the very clear ocean waters here you can
see shapes far below the waves from this view as
well You can see elements of a reef in the
distance You can see a few broken and long
siltcovered remnants of ships that had sunk in
this harbor from long ago Its breathtaking in a
way you werent expecting You can keep gawking
if that is your preference but the lighthouse is
up top Follow me
 To the top floor you have the view of
everything around you not just that front view
of the harbor but this beautiful image of the
ocean and the shoreline and the fields and rolling
hills that surround Nicodranas of the Cyrios
Mountains to the north and then far to the east
you can see the jungles that then vanish up the
sides of the Ashkeeper Peaks Its a tremendous
view and then the entire city below Its once
again increasingly breathtaking from the one you
previously had This is my home
 Damn right You should keep up do more
cardio
 No not really
 Kind of prickly
 No seriously If your friend with the pink
hair wasnt here I wasnt going to let you in
 Now that youve focused on this there are
no windows to the lighthouse Theres a metal
structure that holds up the top this faint
by foot dome that marks the ceiling of it
Each of these openings between these metal rods
that holds that up are where the light protrudes
You can see now the marine layer starting to burn
away in the midday and most of the fog is
receded towards the horizon the blue sky having
returned you see this roughcut quartzlike
crystal thats about three and a half four feet in
diameter thats set in the center of this top floor
 It is my responsibility to invoke the
Mothers blessing of the stone and each day have
its light guide the ships back to safe shore
 I can sense Even looking upon you I can
smell decay
 That is very astute of you It was at a time
when their temperaments were less in conflict
They two the union blessed upon this shore the
gifts of stone that then built this tower
 Well I can maybe help with one and
probably laugh at the other So choose carefully
 Cute
 Ive seen this man around in the streets
below
 No I dont really talk to people I look at
them below She points over to the edge and
theres actually a spyglass leaning against the edge
She goes I see a lot that goes on in this city
 No But I know there are things beneath
it
 There are a couple of places I believe
 I do not know where he lives
 Make a persuasion check with disadvantage
 As you instinctually reach for the
spyglass she slaps your hand No
 Because it is my eye in the sky not yours
Insolent child
 Depending When he disappears to do most
of his work beneath in the Sluice something
There are two submerged gates in the harbor
 The Sluice Weave yes Not that youd know
that technically
 Its fine its all good
 I know Youre done Caleb is murdered No
 Metagaming seagull

  The harbor has protectors and has
for many generations that exist beneath the
waters in this city That is part of how the
Sluice functions I believe this Algar person you
mentioned works in some sort of managerial
position there
 Probably need some sort of a small boat or
something But if youre going to go there and you
dont have approval youll probably be
arrested
 Are you a goblin
 Yes
 And youre working with these people
 Shes pretty hideous
 Look its okay It is something we have in
common
 What do you think Ive lived alone here my
whole live because Im a spinster
  Its okay
 I think I could too
 Please Theyre beginning to grate on me
 
  What is this
 This is a very kind gesture very
thoughtful
 You as well All right now get out
 Sets it down on a little side table and
quickly pushes you back towards the stairs
 Yeah above you
 What are you trying to do
 Make a stealth check
 You got to do that beforehand
 As youre heading down the stairs you jump
off to the side in that small alcove where the
window is And then a second one of you appears
She begins to walk past you then stops and turns
right and looks right at you and goes Are you
going to join your friend of you

 Good Go
 As she pushes you all shes not answering
any more questions Shes like Out out out
out You both of you Her hands pass through
your duplicitous image She goes Thats strange
Okay out Thank you for the tea goodbye
goodbye goodbye
  
 Beauregard whats your passive perception
 
 Oh theyre down here actually Okay good
to know All right you guys eventually meet up
 You guys have been outside probably about
three hours or so total Of travel and asking and
getting questions Id say two and a half
 Yeah
 You guys eventually gather in the center of
the Open Quay This is the western side of the
docks on the city Whereas the Restless Wharf
seems to be a really busy dockyard that runs a
very tight ship and seems to be filled with
elements of cheap entertainment and in that vein
the Open Quay its a little a little bit smaller
It seems to be less organized But in the center
of it is this one massive tower that looms over
the entire district of this side of the docks
Its an emerald stone dark green with elements
of light green flecked through it spire that
seems very out of place amongst the rest of the
storage buildings and the various other small
homesteads and businesses that fill this entire
area It seems to be dotted with a number of small
balconies and comes to a slight roofed peak that
is like a sharpened point Its very out of place
here Youve passed by it a couple times before
but you havent really inquired much about it as
most of your business here had been on the job so
youve not really cared to ask or question
 Sure you grab an older fisherman thinning
hair very sunweathered face is carrying a small
sack over his shoulder various supplies and
coiled rope over the other shoulder as hes
heading off towards the docks Stops and turns
Can I help you
 Thats Tide Peak Thats the tower of Yussa
Errennis the mage who owns this district
 Yes To the chagrin of the Clovis Concord
yes
 You could say that I need to get to
work
 Yussa YUSSA
 Errenis ERRENIS
 There are Zolezzo around the area Theyre
still keeping the peace here but there are no
Zolezzo guarding the tower
 Yeah a few hundred feet I would say from
the tower
 Yeah
 Okay You approach it The district
distinctly around this tower the road is very
wide surrounding it No buildings are buttressed
against it It seems to be solitary amongst the
rest of the constructed buildings here
 The folks that are walking in the streets
nearby tend to walk on the opposite side of the road
 Nope Its just ground Its built in the
center of this district and everythings either
built or shaped around it
 Make an investigation check
 You get up to the tower and begin to inspect
its build All the stones here look freshly cut
Not a lot of wear and tear weathering to them
Its hard to tell how long its been here It
seems like it couldve been installed last week
or   years ago
 About ten feet before you began to really
make that assessment
 You go and touch it Its cold stone
 Not yet
 Yeah its a tower spire but the base of
it is probably somewhere between  to
 feet in diameter
 Okay You guys run around meet on the other
side No entrance
 No windows There are the balconies but the
first balcony is maybe  feet up
 Yeah theyre sporadically cast around it
At its peak its probably about  feet tall
 Yeah its this long spire
 No and to help the visual thing I said 
feet wide diameter Thats a bit wide for what I
was originally thinking Its about maybe  feet
 Thats your estimation from this fore point
Make an acrobatics check
 You have advantage because hes helping
you
 You run leap Fjord catches your foot and
gives you the meager not very strong lift but
something to help Your first foot hits the wall
the second one hits and you get a moment of
traction Before you  You only get maybe
  feet off the ground before you 
 Fjord steps back and you 
 Thankfully you have slow fall as a monk
ability
 You would take six points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall
 Yeah monks can fall from very high and
threepoint landing and be fine You still hit
your tailbone and it still stings a little but
you dont take any damage
 You guys round the corner and you watch
Beau suddenly slam into the ground near the
central tower
 You dont really know
 Well the Quay is the district Youre in
the district right now
 Yeah its a heavily residential district
for the more affordable and cheaper residents
 No
 The Meandering Treasurer is a shop
 Make an investigation check
 If youre looking around the Open Quay
there are a few people that point you towards The
Withered Bird Inn which is an inn and tavern and
youve probably passed by it before once the
direction is pointed out youre like Yeah no
Ive been there its a little divey but its popular
amongst the sailors and folks that come through
If youre looking for something in the Restless
Wharf the only place that really comes to your
attention thats told is The Wayfarers Cove
 More birds must die
 Its maybe  minutes away
 You make your way out of the Open Quay
towards the Restless Wharf district once more Fjord
 You keep looking over your shoulder your
interest towards the Tide Peak tower Its
shorter it looks and you begin to understand how
you didnt notice a foot tower when you first
entered the city or one youve been around before
and youve been to this city before It seems the
further away you walk the tower seems to visually
shrink within the city skyline Its still visible
as a tower and its still taller than most of the
buildings but as soon as you guys get quite a
ways away youre like That cant be more than
maybe  feet tall
 No
 It vanishes and then you hear  and
you look over your shoulder One of the small
tables on the side of one of the various warehouses
that contained a bucket that had a bunch of tools
and various repair materials for ships has been
knocked over and the puppys tumbling out of it
 Runs up to you and jumps back into your
arms
 Thats basically what he is
 Puppies are useless at this age man
 Finishing the rest of your jaunt here as
Fjord is making equations in the air in front of
him you eventually make your way by asking a few
more questions towards the Wayfarers Cove As
you approach this dark looking dive that is
probably furthest of all the other bars or taverns
youve seen here out towards the docks itself The
super dark wood that its constructed of makes it
look almost like a blighted barnacle on the rest
of this wharf area As you approach the exterior
you can see a large piece of driftwood that
probably belonged to a ship long before that had
either fallen in the ocean or after its final
voyage was pulled apart and then elements of it
were used to either build or embellish on the
structure It looks like the kind of bar that was
salvaged or was built from salvage
 As you step through the entry way the
doors open slightly ajar you pull it open The
interior has no music there is just whispers and
conversation The smell hits you immediately the
smell is a combination of mossy musk from wood
that has been soaked with seawater and then left
to dry hundreds of times over as well as the
various forms of liquor and ale that have been
spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies
and a lot unwashed sailor scent
 Yeah the odor in here is not pleasant
definitely that of the working man or woman who
comes in from the sea Glancing inside there is a
bar to the immediate left where there is a rather
crotchety looking fellow halfelf who is heavily
scarred on one side of his face A bit heavy set
for a halfelf For the elven lineage its rare
to see someone who has not displayed the more
lithe side of the blood line but this elf has
either worked hard to fight that side of their
bloodline and has a bit of a paunch and a bit of
a soft chin and jawline He looks over to you and
nods He goes Let me know if you need a drink
or something Spits off to the side Looking
inside glancing about the small number of patrons
here theres only five of them at the bar this
time of day You see one really old salty looking
sailor who has this heavy cap pulled down over his
ears to the point where he has these bushy white
eyebrows that poof underneath where the fold of it
brims upward and has this big puffed chinstrap
beard around the side His lips are pressed up to
where you can tell he probably has no teeth so
his jaw can press all the way up towards the roof
of his mouth and hes sitting there with a large
dark green bottle of some sort of beer or ale and
is just staring forward chewing quietly Off to
the right hand side you see for some of you the
first time what looks to be a very very large
humanoid turtle You see them sitting on a bench
Youve seen a few tortles in your travels but
they dont normally travel northward into the
Empire This one is sitting there hunched over a
table by themself with a heavy tankard that
theyre clutching with both of their hands You
see bits of rope that are tied across in a lattice
over elements of the shell and on the right side
of the shell you see emerging three pipes or
horns of some kind that are either carved or
embedded on the right side of the shell It looks
like three exhaust pipes if you will but theyre
made from some sort of ivorytype material They
look chipped a little bit and worn As it turns
back its extended head and a snapjaw type nose
curves back and you see an eye patch over the
right eye and just grins You see these series of
tattoos up each arm that look like swirling water
that curl into themselves and end right at the
forearm It goes back to its drink and sips a bit
from it You see another patron in the far back is
a woman with weathered darkbrown skin
The hair itself is this tattered wild mass of
curled and crimped hair thats graying heavily
towards the tips She has a long light brown coat
made of leatherlike material that probably hangs
down to the floor from where shes sitting and
where her calfhigh boots are visible from under
the side Shes sitting across from somebody whos
dressed as a readytoaction shipmate They have a
basic billowing shirt that is opened down to the
mid chest They have a ruddier complexion
probably sunburned over and over again to the
point where now it just looks like theyre
perpetually sunburned He looks younger probably
in his s the woman looks maybe in her mid to
late s or so Both human and they both glance
over as you enter the dark interior contrasted by
the very bright light that silhouettes your
figures as you step within The Wayfarers Cove
And thats where were going to pick up next week
 Its a weird place
 She had dark kind of caught crazy hair
that
 It goes gray about halfway down and goes to
a graywhite at the tips Its this mane of hair
 Well pick up in the next week In the
meantime we missed you guys Happy to be back

Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back Cool Last we left off The
Mighty Nein had made their way south absconding
from the tensions of the north Dwendalian Empire
to seek a few possible threads of mystery to the
south shores and coasts of the Menagerie Coast
You made your way through the Wuyun Gorge
purchased a few pets and then eventually found
yourselves for many of you your first time at
the beach at the coast seeing an ocean seeing
the waves seeing the sand and took a brief bit
of time to relish in that experience Eventually
making your way to Nicodranas in time for the
sunset across the western ocean You began to
notice the workforce that goes through the day and
dwindles to the night that works alongside the
numerous number of ships that come in and then
stay along the wharf and the various docks in the
vicinity You made your way through the not very
stealthy But were not in character yet so Ill
allow it You made your way throughout various
districts of the city eventually meeting the
Ruby of the Sea Marion Lavorre After having some
time to catch up with her exchange information
about your travels you discovered that there had
been some issues with one client of hers in the
town and managed to gather a little bit of
information but began to seek more about this
Algar this figure who had grown jealous of other
clientele and seemed to be becoming a point of
concern for Marion You took it upon yourselves to
look into this individual and find a way to
possibly resolve this while you were in town You
also began to run into some other curious
mysteries You went to the lighthouse and spoke
with the lighthouse keeper there for a bit You
had found a strange tower in the Open Quay
  Then eventually discovered along
the wharf a tavern with a familiar name based on
some of the previous things you were keeping an
stepped into the darkened interior of this the
smell of old wet wood combined with the dried
liquors and ales that had long stained the various
tables and floorboards of this dank and relatively
musty bar Looking across the clientele a few
interesting persons caught your attention and
thats where we left off So Mighty Nein as you
begin to enter this darkened torchlit interior
lantern I would say slowly hanging from various
portions of the ceiling crossbeams the bits of
wind that push them causing them to slightly
shift and have this shifting crackle of firelight
within the chamber what do you wish to do
 Do you walk up and approach him
 Sitting there on the table both these
large scaled coming to the point of these hooked
claws these hands are wrapped around this heavy
tankard The head shifts over your direction where
the eye patch meets your gaze first before the
other eye creeps past the extending hard brow
Im sorry what you asking eh
 Well tthats certainly a possibility
cher
 You dont think that perhaps someones
going to tell you their life story just without
even knowing you You can buy me a drink first
 Very well
  He raises one of his fingers up
towards the bar and the bartender glances up Oh
another round okay He turns around and begins
preparing what looks to be another drink Lowers
his hand and claw which scrapes across the wood
and leaves this little curl of little shaving
that is put to the side as his hand comes to rest
looking back at you with his one eye How about
this then Lets trade a story huh
 Yyou tell me where youre from and why it
brought you in to my table then mmaybe Ill tell
you how I lost this yeah
  No
 Drink gets brought down to the table Dont
worry shes going to take care of it
 Its a silver for that so its an easy trade
off
 Okay well for a round of drinks and the
milks involved as well thatll put you well say
at about two silver
 Im going to be perfectly honest
 that was
a lot mmore than I was asking But I appreciate it
 He turns and you hear the creaking of
leather as the long extended neck turns the folds
of skin pushing against themselves Oh this Got
this here on sea maybe about six or seven years ago
 He reaches back and you can see its
interesting because on the right side of the shell
it looks like elements have been carved through
where these pipes have been put in on the back On
the front theres a small deflated pouch of
leather and a small extended tube of metal He
lifts it with one hand and breathes into it and it
inflates a bit and inflates a bit You see his one
eye look around mischievously to everyone else at
the bar and goes I mean yyou asked
 This trio of
bagpipes begin blasting out of these large almost
shellsculpted pipes that curve out of his shell
and everyone in the room just immediately starts
grabbing their ears going Ah and start throwing
things over clanking off of his shell
 Only a few notes in because while hes
mischievously enjoying the moment of shattering
the calm and chill in the chamber hes not going
to get himself thrown out so he stops and goes
That theres how I keep the other shipmates
entertained
 Its been a number of mmmonths since I
found me a good ship and a purpose out there on
the ocean sea but Ive been known to be a rather
decent second mate and navigator
 Thats not my mmmoniker

 Orly
 Orly Skiffback
 Skiffback
 Now Ive been forthcoming in my ddirect
title Mmmight I ask what your individual names
may be
 Very well Welcome to this shithole He
grabs his drink and sips Takes a few moments and
looks around again Yall still lingering for
some reason
 Cant say that I have there son my
apologies However youre mmmore than welcome to
ask around Im sure theres a whole mighty
spectrum of curious travelers that come in and out
of here
 More the latter than the former I got to
jive with the right crew More like they got to
jive with me I mean and he does this
Imafuckingtortle physicality to it
 Well theyre an acquired taste Id say
perhaps cherie
 Yeah Id say so
 Why you asking
 If I mmight inquire
 Make a persuasion check
 I can say Ive seen him around
Occasionally the boy has needed a place to crash
and Ive provided my shack my abode when hes
been drinking too hard or comes in with some sort
of a mmark on his face
 Only in occasionally
 Nnot in a few days no
 Dont pay attention dont care none
 You see him getting guarded the more you
start asking about Marius a little bit Caduceus
you specifically as youre watching this you get
the sense that hes offered up a little bit of
information but that little bit seems to have
caused him to reel in Hes being guarded and
doesnt seem very forthcoming though he passes it
off as a lack of information
 You said something about a delivery
 Theres a shifting to Orly at which point
the last of the air in the small pouch gets pushed
in and it  slowly comes to
rest
  MMMarius aint really what youd
call seatrekking folk More of a slimy shadow
word peddler However last time I saw him not but
maybe a week ago I recall he was complaining
Waiting on something to be delivered Never found
its way around Was getting real that boy owes a
lot of money
 Make a persuasion check
 Yeah
  Orly looks you straight with his one
good eye glances up and down You get a good
look The leather eye patch itself has its own
carving into it like it was wettened at one point
and then shaved to have a very similar pattern as
the curling wave tattoos that match his upper arms
and you can now see the backs and sides of his
neck Looking through you for a moment goes
 Let me tell you something If what you say
is true it could very well be that you and your
friends here might have a way of taking some of
the weight off of MMMarius I havent seen him
in some time but I do know sometimes he hangs
around the docks at night Round mmmidnight
Sometimes hes meeting folks in ships and selling
things I can only imagine is illegal Sometimes
hes picking things up
 What you looking for
 skinnyass little
halfelf fellow Sides of his head shaved real low
Tiny little fuzz
 With a big old flop of blonde hair hangs
around in front of the face
 Other than that he dont dress mmmighty
rich or anything Tends to stay out of sight so
maybe be best you keep a keen eye around the
shadows huh
 If all goes well and you end up doing him a
solid dont be afraid to tell him that Orly put
you in the right direction huh
 If not dont say a fucking word
 Scratches the bottom of the chin looking at
you
 Yeah theres an older fishermanlooking
gentleman whos sitting there minding his own
business staring at his own drink though now
hes glaring over this large group thats
conversing after blowing bagpipes in the middle of
his previously solitary afternoon Theres a
woman probably late s early s or so with a
very big mass of hair that goes from a dark brown
to a gray to white at the tips almost like a
mane Dark skin looks weathered from lots of
travel and probably seen quite a bit in her day A
light brown coat that hangs over the edge of the
chair shes sitting in Theyre all looking at you
guys because you all come storming in here cause
this ruckus talking to the tortle
 Yeah you guys arent the most subtle of
arrivals
 Make an insight check
 Hard to tell
 Do you guys stay with Orly or
 He looks like he is enjoying his drink and
hes not giving you any particular vibe in your
direction He doesnt seem to mind but hes not
engaging Most of his conversation is reactive at
the moment
 What are you talking about
 I dont either my apologies I dont
know
 Make an insight check
 Hes smiling with his response and in all
your time youre not very well versed in the tics
and the subtle facial reads for tortles
 Oh thats fine There are all sorts of
problems throughout this city You end up taking
one down thats one mmmore that we dont got to
piss on
 Well that just aint going to stand now
is it cherie You got to respect peoples mmmamas
 While youre having this conversation Fjord
has walked over to the other table and the woman
sitting there her hands resting on the side
 Trailing as well
 As you guys approach with Fjord towards the
front she watches you
 Well Im going to be honest Its hard not
to draw my attention with that very subtle display
youve all managed to provide
 This here Wine
 Its wine Red Why you buying
  Ill always care for more
 For just her or for both of you
 Okay Thatll put you back well say
 No well say one silver for just her for
one round
 To be completely honest I dont spend a
lot of time in the Quay I tend to focus more on
this side The business is better I dont know
why Im focused on that other eye Im stuck in
that I just noticed that No its good She was
leaning this way
 I know and its a problem already She
goes Ive seen it Ive certainly gazed and seen
that weird tower I think thats what youre
referring to
 Oh no just passing through Taking a
break Ive only been here for about a week and
then shoving off back to this trade route towards
Marquet probably
 You a sailor as well
 Whats your specialty I might be looking
for crew
 Whats your rank
 But youre looking to travel
 I maybe got room for one more in the crew
if you want to come along Prove yourself a few
days at sea
 She glances off to the side and points on
the far left side of the harbor I cant really
show you from here Follow me She steps up and
walks past you towards the front and points to one
ship Past there the one with the grayish sails
furled up Thats the Drensala Vis Thats my ship
 Shes been through a lot but shes stuck
with me for many years
 I didnt catch yours
 Who is this guy
 This your friend
 Ive got to say Im pretty intrigued by a
strongbacked smallranked sailor looking for
work that walks around with his own accountant
 Caleb Widogast
 Fjord Just Fjord
 Well Im just Captain Adella Pleasure to
meet you
 I think when we round up with a full crew
and supplies gathered up Probably want to take
some time to relax here in town for another week
or so and then well head off Its probably going
to be a good six seven months journey before we
come back But if you and your accountant friend
are looking to come we got room for two more
 If you want to pay passage
 Yeah direct Couple stops along the coast
but
 Very well
 You as well
 Thats about as much as Ive heard I tend
not to poke around places that act weird strange
magics and such Lot of folks that get too curious
end up not coming back
 She goes Not in my crew
 Yeah halfelf fella Yeah he was in here
a few months back when I was last docked in
Nicodranas Working with that lowlife Cadmus
Havent seen him since though
 Cadmus Leeland You know Cadmus Leeland
 Hes a right fuckface Ill tell you
that
 Yeah
 Make a history check
 You have heard of Cadmus Cadmus goes under
the guise of a shipping merchant that hops from
port to port but for those who work heavily in
the shipping lanes hes known to be a thief one
that skims off the top Recently his business has
come to a crawl as hes instead been staying out
to sea possibly from what rumors have said been
involved in the shaking down of ships without
means of protecting themselves
 You also with that roll you know the name
 Not in your readings no You havent spent
a lot of time studying maritime history
 I dont think you have
 Why whats this Sabian to you
 All right but Id do my best to stay away
from Cadmus The guys a right asshole If your
friends palling around with him I dont know
what kind of shit your friends getting into these days
 At this point Captain Adella looks over
your shoulder a bit and goes Anyway Im going
to go finish my wine Its been a pleasure
 You guys have moved back into the bar and
in the doorway you see a figure appear A looming
figure Theres the dark silhouette against the
bright sun in the sky behind You see over one
shoulder some sort of large sack that has been
thrown over and held with one arm The other sits
at the side with a sword sheathed across that
shoulder Stepping into the light you see the
familiar and somewhat surprised face of Yasha
Ashley if you want to jump in here if you dont mind
 You guys spin around to see the broad
shoulders and intimidating presence of Yasha step
into the dark bar interior Yasha you step inside
looking for a moment of respite and a drink and
are caught off guard by the group that is now
staring back at you with the same aghast expression
 The bartender goes and gathers a couple
bottles of wine Thatll run you fair or fine wine
 Thatll be for two bottles  gold
 For a passing somewhat briny wine run you
about two gold for two bottles
 You have no idea who that is
 You see this bright crimson weasel that is
now curled up in your hand and 
 It pisses right in your hand
 As you say dog you look down and you can
see the right side of your boot is now being
slightly moistened by the urine of the tiny puppy
All the animals are apparently marking you as
their territory But you see this tiny light
brown puppy with big oversized paws and a couple
of faint stripes across the fur these pointy
feyfeatured elements more angular than a softer
puppy should and these eyes look up at you

 The somewhat portly halfelf greets you as
you approach again All right would you like
another drink
 Oh why wait its good to have a backup
right
 All right very well
 Im sorry what The big blue tower over in
the Quay
 Yeah I know of it yeah Why Why do you
ask
 Yeah its got some weird sort of illusion
magic to it Its creepy
 Belongs to some mage Hes been here for a
while named Yussa
 A mystery to me I dont fucking go and
start climbing up towers to ask questions where
they dont belong
 Thats um
 Same or
 He goes and prepares looking at this
Would you prefer a pitcher
 Thinking back you had received these words but
not having a lot of experience with this type of
spell contact before you werent sure if it was
you imagining things or having a slight nervous breakdown
 Everyone curls over
 The chair falls over
 It finds its way to the ground Theres a
pause as everyone looks around
 Theres a continued pause as they all look
around
 Doing a pass across everybody in this room
with a discerning eye especially with your
Passive Insight you get the sense that nobody
here really knows this Algar figure
 The Lavish Chateau
 Orly is clapping with his giant
mittlike clawed tortle hands Not too bad

 Thats what you were told from the light
keeper at the lighthouse She said as far as she
knew the entrances that she knows of are beneath
the docks Where the land falls off and meets the
ocean and the docks are out there its somewhere
underwater there
 All right Youre not that far away
thankfully Youve been hanging around the
Restless Wharf for a while which is where the
tavern was Striking out towards the edge and
looking across the docks theres one large ship
that came in and looks like a lot of stuff is
being unloaded and is busy on that end Not that
far off of it the next dock that shoots out and
turns to the right there looks like theres a couple of
anchored ships there Its a little less busy
looks like theyre currently moored there and not
a lot of folks are doing business on or around
the ships other than just keeping a watch on the docks
themselves
 Make a perception check
 You dont see anything in the way of a ship
shack right now You do see a man An older
grizzled fisherman of some kind or at least a dock
worker He has this long cap on that dangles past
his midshoulders in a heavy dark gray cloth
shirt that is drenched with sweat like hes been
doing hard work throughout most of the day You see him
currently tying a small rowboat to the edge there
and holding it in place
 Oh yeah this here is my boat Whats your
name sir
 Fjord Jimmy
 Pleasure to meet you
 You much of a shipman yourself
 Well say because you have a sailors
background at this point you guys converse back
and forth a bit You swap some stories with
him about how he used to be a dockworker and some
of the ships he was on back in the day
 Yeah about five minutes of back and forth
you get to the point where youre both laughing
and feel comfy Eventually he goes Dont even
worry about the money just Ill keep an eye on
out here and dont take it too far out in the bay
When youre done bring it back
 Least I could do He goes ahead and helps
untie the boat You have it at your disposal
 You can certainly try Comfortably it can
fit four people Uncomfortably it could fit you
all spacewise youre uncertain as to the ships
ability to hold the load
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It doesnt change his weight but
 Yeah volumetrically it wouldnt make that
much of a difference for you
 Fjord just disappears beneath the surface
 She pointed a basic direction but there was
no visual guide to it
 You come out dripping the water slowly
pouring out from under your armor
 Ive heard of that but I dont really know
much about that sorry
 Good luck though
 Yeah Theres a handful of other people
that are in the process of Largely on the other
side where that bigger ship is thats being
currently unloaded or loaded into you cant tell
from this distance
 Zolezzo
 There are You can see two zolezzo that are
just patrolling the docks
 Ten minutes
 Make a general insight check to try and
gauge which of them is the most insecure
 Thats not bad at all
 All right You look and of the two that are
there one of them seems to be pretty preoccupied
with the ships that are being loaded And one of
them appears to be halfpresent probably in
middaydream yawning at his post and looks
younger than the other one Between the two of
them hes probably the most insecure if you had
to decide
 Im sorry can I help you
 Im sorry I am working at the moment
 You can see his eyes roll and he goes What
can I do to help you then
 He sighs heavily and reaches out and finally
takes the hand He goes Hello I am Zolezzo Merpol
 Make a persuasion check
 
 He goes Oh that is a very specific
curiosity
 Well the Sluice Weave is a series of
tunnels that were installed probably a century ago
that are responsible for They are ducts that
guide water from the ocean to a series of small
engines in the city that help propel the furnaces
that the various businesses and locations here
that require that sort of intense power to
utilize Its also
 Well not haunted per se But there
are
 He goes Not haunted but there are
elements to it
 Hes like 

 He goes There also There are things that
help maintain the Sluice ducts and occasionally
help protect elements of the bay if ever its
under attack
  I mean theres been You
know About a year ago they had this one ship that
came into the There were these thieves And I
happened to be on job at the moment and so yeah
 I havent been down in the Sluice area
there The entrance as far as I know is mostly
hidden the one inside the city
 Somewhere I dont know
 Yeah theres two or three I think that
are right down off the side Here come here
And he leads you over
  He leads you over across the dock
for a bit And he points down in the water and
goes I think somewhere in this vicinity there is
sort of the intake tube or pipe where the ocean
water is brought in to the Sluice ducts
 Make a perception check
 Perception yes
 From this distance its too hard to see
beneath the water It gets a little too murky But
he points in a general direction and you get a
loose idea of where it may be
 Hes like So what are you up to while
youre in the city

 Of course Where are you staying
 Oh wow That is a very expensive place
 You can see the visible  to
his chest Hes like Well perhaps Ill If you
want other things to see around the city when Im
not on my post I could maybe come by and give you
a little tour
 Of course What are you doing right now I
only have about  minutes until I get to switch
my shift and then Im off for the rest of the
afternoon
 He looks a bit flabbergasted
 See you later What was it What was the
name Tracy
 He sits there for a second and goes
Tracy
 Yeah Merpol
  Merpol
 Yeah no Different name He thinks to
himself Tracy And continues the rest of his
post along the dockside
 So what are you doing
 Into a
 Ooh
 As you guys all begin to gather into the
boat the two of you I think you said youre
staying off to the side Jester and Fjord
 Yeah theres extra rope available So you
guys swim beneath as it continues off through the
water
 Okay
 Well find out Roll a stealth check
 Plus
 Everyone but Fjord sees you

 You guys begin to row over in that
direction Who all is keeping an eye in the
water
 All right Go ahead and make a perception
check please
 Sure So go ahead and take advantage on
that between you and Frumpkin
 Okay Glancing through the water you watch
as one of the sun rays definitely hits a clear
patch of the ocean below you And you see a brief
glimmer of what looks to be a either metal or
stone piece that is different from the rest of the
natural slightly eroded rock You see a circle
maybe a four or fivefootwide opening thats
about  feet down
 All righty
 Okay So there is a circular pipe entrance
or a tunnel entrance  feet down right as the
water gets darker and more murky Bits of
clustered seaweed begin to come up and tickle the
bottoms of Frumpkins tentacles in that vicinity
Elements of it are blocking the front but you can
clearly see there is a dark tunnel that continues
into the earth beneath the city beneath the
docks You dont know how far it goes
necessarily
 Make a perception check
 You do not see anything alive or moving in
this vicinity Best you can see the tunnel
continues in for about  or so feet and there is
a metal grate You can see eight or so bars
across Actually about ten bars about an inch
thick each and theyre horizontal though its a
little bit tilted to one side
 With eight of them and its about four and a
half five feet across Sorry ten across It
would be about six inches between each
 Yeah your octopus could
 All right
 Oh the bars There isnt a lot of rust as
much as there is a lot of barnacles and other
natural sediment that is gathered on edges of it
You can still see the metal You can see a little
bit of rust here and there Looks like more
natural elements seem to have crusted and
clustered around parts of it
 Okay
About Lets see here About  or so feet
into the tunnel it curves upward
 Yeah
 All right About  or so feet up the water
breaks Theres a surface though there is no
light Does Frumpkins octopus form have
darkvision
 Yes Okay So does Frumpkin
 Okay Frumpkin floats there on top for a
second and you can see now where it emerges
 There is another set of bars right at the
top of that tunnel that Frumpkin has pushed and
squeezed through to come through So theres bars
like a grate on the way in and then a grate once
you curve upward into the tunnel
 Come through a second set and then breaks
the surface of the water about a foot beyond that
And now you can see it is closed off mostly
except for a tunnel that continues deeper in the
same direction that the lower tunnel went And
that one continues on for a bit
 There is no air between the water and the
grate
 Yeah Its all water up and then theres
the grate and then it turns into this tunnel that
continues inward and theres about a foot of
water beyond that and then theres air from that point
 Make an investigation check for Frumpkin
  You can still mutter the incantation
underwater
 Yeah in the process of casting a spell if
youre holding your breath thats your breath
 Thats the way to do it Looking there is
no locking mechanism The grate isnt one that
opens and closes its not a door its just in
place
 Another investigation check
 Perception check
 The second grate also appears to not have a
locking or unlocking mechanism they arent meant
to be removed it seems in a casual way They
seem to be placed there intentionally for an
indefinite period of time
  You see a number of fish swirling
through the various bits of kelp and seaweed that
are pushing up from the bottom of the bay below
Its beautiful You can see the colors and
glistening bits of silver as the fish curl through
the sunlight but nothing catches your attention
as dangerous in your immediate vicinity
thankfully
 Make a perception check
 What did you roll
 Okay You look out and people seem to be
working on the dock and you know
 Okay So youre sending him further in
 The tunnel goes on for about another  or
so feet beyond that grate before the tunnel opens
up into a squarelike chamber with a singular
pillar that marks the center of it Its still one
foot of water all throughout this entire area
Once you go past this You can look past where
this pillar is the chamber seems to close off and
another tunnel continues on almost like this is
just a waypoint chamber On the right side you
two feet across with a more dense crosslattice
of bars
 Frumpkins size How big of an octopus is
Frumpkin An octopus Id say it would be about
that big
 But octopuses can squeeze through some
pretty small spaces Yeah so Id say make an
athletics check for tiny octopus Frumpkin
 Frumpkin gets partially through but
the nature of the lattice and Frumpkins
unfamiliarity with the octopus form reaches a
point where it cant quite get all the way through
 Looks like basic stonework it has a slight
curvature to it but its probably placed in here
either as a load bearing piece since this is
beneath a heavier city or It doesnt look
remarkable or have any other purpose beyond just
being a support pillar
 The water only goes up to a foot and then
its air for the rest of it Its about ten or so
feet tall the chamber
 Make a perception check
 No guys no better adventure then having all
your friends sit back and send your tiny friend
 Yeah exactly No I know
 So  Looking around the water and its
salt water its all ocean water coming in here
Occasionally you see slight waves little ripples
from different directions
 Make an intelligence check
 Yeah
 Its probably a little over  feet beyond
where you are now though you are probably in the
boat about  or  feet back So its about 
 feet Which you couldnt because its 
foot range for to
 To pull him back yeah
 Okay cool So you are fine Best you can
tell over there it looks like some sort of
warehouse Its a larger storage building its
not remarkable in its design or decor
 The tentacles wrap over the shoulders and
underneath
 The puppy is in the boat like panting
barks
 The three of you dive down Which one of you
has the lead line
 Who has the other end of it
 Fjord has it You guys all dive down taking
a breath pushing through the seaweed until
eventually you come to the base of where that tube
is A few feet into it you see the grate and
its about roughly four and a half fivefoot
diameter so you have to crouch down but you can
get a hold on this
 All right One of you roll with advantage or
you both roll independently
 
 Right but  total
 Thats the DC you needed
 Yeah so you both are holding on and
pulling You get your foot in some of the
imperfect stonework where elements of the masonry
pokes out which gives you a foot groove and one
part where some of the stone had been rotted away
and thats just enough of a point to lock yourself
in As you pull you feel  and
eventually it comes out of its mooring on the wall
and then slides off to the side You rotate it a
bit and it comes to rest in the middle of it
 So you guys go ahead and come back onto it
again
 Well you guys all have pretty high
constitutions so not really
 It works out just so you guys know your
constitution modifier is how many minutes you can
hold your breath underwater
 Actually technically its one plus your
constitution modifier so its even more
 The rope you found here Its probably  to
 feet at most
 All right you do that You guys all jump
back in a second time
 You dive back down below pushing through
the darker depths of the bay eventually finding
yourselves back to the tunnel where the grate has
been shifted to the side So now you have at an
angle underneath you can swim over or under it
You guys pincer off of it taking two different
directions and meeting on the opposite side You
go a few more lengths before the tunnel shifts
upward You both have darkvision if I recall
Good because there was no light source in the
water beyond just the distant glow and shifting
of the sunlight through the water You make your
way back up and you find the grate above you
This area the footholds arent as easy because
its not quite as close to the elements so the
DCs a little higher but if you guys grab hold
you can go ahead and make a check
 That with your modifier is a 
  okay You both hold on this time Youre
having a hard time getting any sort of a foothold
into the space Jester you angrily look down and
taking your elbow you jam a section of the stone
until it breaks off and you find a section of
 Noticing this Yasha you do the same and
smash You guys actually break a few footholds
into the side of this tunnel Once youre set into
place you look at each other count to the right
moment and pull I mean youve seen Jester do
some cool stuff but in that moment its a Rosie Riveter
 Muscle moment as guns going the metal
bars bend slightly  From underneath
the water you hear the echo and then it comes
loose from the mooring and begins sinking down
towards both of you The heavy metal is now
sandwiching you guys towards the bottom and you
push off and manage to get it to rotate and you
swim around it without having an issue
 Yep
 You guys make it to the surface 
 and youre now inside the tunnel
Its strangely
 Okay you guys watch as Fjord breaks the
surface without the other two
 All right
 I would like you to make a wisdom saving
throw Nott please
 Your fear subside momentarily and you find
yourself instinctually nodding as you know what
maybe trying it once and seeing how it goes is
exactly what Caleb would want
  Going under water you hear the
 The diminishing squeak as it slowly vanishes
beneath the surface Caduceus and Caleb sitting up
in the ship with a weasel and a puppy
 So as Beau swims now Beau go ahead and
make an athletics check for me because you are
technically carrying two passengers
 Its a little cocked
 Yeah that counts
 No if you can rest a d on it
 Yeah
 Strongly pushing through using the grate to
go ahead and pull yourself forward beneath the
surface You bring your goggles down so you can
actually see where youre going once the light
begins to subside You still hear in the water
above you 
 Oh you dont even know You know nothing
about it Youre just like I got this Swing
upward break the surface  Come up from
the top and there you can see Yasha and Jester
waiting for you they are stepped up into the
tube
 You hear  You look down
as this waterlogged weasel is now like coughing
and sneezing
 Its awake and conscious Youre just
pushing on its chest
 Its just sitting in the boat looks over
the edge 
 Make a persuasion check Actually this would
be animal handling
 Yeah
 In your robes theres a comfortable little
cradle that you form there and then puppy
whining  and then appears into the small
pocket in your arm
 Perception check
 Looking around no one in particular seems
to be paying much mind to what your business is
 I will ask you to make an athletics check
because you are swimming mostly with one arm and
your legs as you are cradling the puppy with the
other
  You make your way partway
through the tunnel and under the grate You get
past that point look up you push off
 Youre tired your lungs are starting to
hurt from just the amount of effort its taking to
go this distance with one arm and your legs
kicking Youve waded in the ponds near the graveyard
 Youre not a practiced swimmer
 Correct the puppy though
 Not yet no Make another athletics check
 For the second half of this journey
 Okay Yeah you get down low to the bottom
of it and push upward Right at that moment you
see this little burst of bubble  in your
arm just as youre about to break the surface You
look down frightened and hes not there and as
you look up break the surface  come up
and you watch as  in the air
 You catch Nugget  Just
waterlogged dripping
 The weasel looks miserable Sprinkle is just
like 
 He curls up in there
 Youre all clustered up in this small
tunnel Its maybe eight feet across and its
cylindrical in its shape
 About a foot and a half of water depending
upon where youre standing in it and it continues
down dark into the next chamber
 Do you point out the grate to them
 As you guys have moved through the tunnel
into the small chamber break in the tunnel path
there with the pillar Caleb points over to the
grate and you can see its a pretty dense lattice
of metal
 Yeah you can get your fingers in Theres
enough space there to get your fingers in more
Each bar is about two inches apart from each
other
 Sure Go ahead and make another strength
check The beast team here
  You get the sense first
off your fingers are sore and your arms are
strained from the two previous exerts that youve
given And youve done impressive things but you
get the sense that this is probably because its
smaller its wedged into a little tighter in the
small tunnel The actual tunnel there is maybe
about a foot across a foot and a half across
Most of you would not even fit through it but
youre unable to get it to budge at all
 Make a perception check
 Looking around it resembles a subterranean
sewer its mostly just stone and masonry thats
slick from the moisture And the air itself is
very humid down here There is a lot of moisture
that gathers across the stone and theres streaks
of color and minerals that have gathered on the
walls over time You still have the taste of the
brine in your mouth from your time under the
ocean but the air in here is still also very
oceanlike and salty
 Make an investigation check
 Looking at it there are certain markers and
the levels that say that there have at times been
different levels of water in here but it doesnt
seem often enough like certain levels of minerals
and sediment that you can see But a lot of them
seem older and havent been reached in a while
 Youre looking for writing You dont see
any writing
 Make a perception check
 Good to you in the past but not tonight
apparently
 Yeah
 Looking around you dont see any markings in
the stonework but as you go across the pillar in
the center looking for any sort of details you
hear this faint almost like the sound of a
crashing wave and the rushing of water and you
glance around the edge and in the corner you can
see the water that previously was just moving from
your breaking the surface moving through has
started to  almost like its forming a
small occasional whirlpool and then comes to
rest for a moment and then
 No
 Yeah
 Okay Frumpkin the tunnel
 Okay Frumpkin has appeared on the other
side While this is happening you watch as the
small whirlpool begins to gather up and rise above
the surface in what is a roughly basketballsized
swirl of water Like an inverse whirlpool
 A second one begins to emerge from the water
behind you
 Theyre essentially looking at reverse
whirlpools that are rising up out of the water
coming to a point as the water seems to be almost
guiding itself
 Okay Roll for attack
 Roll for an attack
 Yep
 Both of them hit Go ahead and roll damage
 Before she even says that roll some damage
Because this is all happening very quickly
 Quick let me check one thing real fast
 No okay So good to know So it was nine
and
 Okay got you You watch as both enter the
water and it seems to react pull back and a
spray of water hits the wall behind it You watch
as it quivers and then suddenly you see these two
large pseudopods of water somehow emerge from it
and you see for a moment this angry face
 in the water towards you as both of
them begin to rush in towards you in the center of
the chamber

 All right friends So last we left off I
need you all to roll initiative
 All right so  to 
 All right so its Beau Anyone else  to
  to 
 
 There you go
  All right  to ten
 Nott What did you get
 And then taking up the rear
 There we go
 Thats all right So first round of battle
Up first you watch as these two emerging
whirlpools begin to form into these amorphous
angry spinning and intenselooking tiny water
spouts with bashing pseudopods that swing out and
attempt to make some sort of heavy impact with
anybody whos nearby They seem strangely
sentient as opposed to being some sort of
manifested trap However with that first initial
attack from Beau thats the first surprise round
well be going into combat At the top of it it
is Beau once again So what are you doing
 Are you running up to attack
 All right
 All right so you go ahead and swing and
 With your staff and as you give a big old
push you watch as it just dissolves and falls
below and youre just swinging into the air It
hits the stonework and  You feel part of
your elbow lock up for a second and it feels a
little numb
  hits
 All right this is with your
 With your staff as well
 Okay
 You notice the first impacts of the
shurikens that you had thrown seem to pass through
the water with some impact but not heavily And
the second staff hit that strikes seems to not be
as impactful against the wood Or maybe against
the water form of this creature
 Go for it
 Nine misses So with your bonus action just
swings wide These things are small but nimble
and they keep their form seems to constantly be
shifting and changing position Its like fighting
a miniature squall in the middle of it So youre
like Ah No impact
 That ends your turn
 All righty next up Jester Youre up
 It is
 There is no light source in here
 So Caleb starts hearing all these noises in
his
 Oh thats right Because you do have dark
vision So yeah right now guys
 Where do you want it to go
 Actually no Firbolgs cant So Caduceus
is the only one in pitch black
 All right here
 You got it
 Technically youd have to move to have line
of sight on where it was dropped so youd have to shift
 There you go So moving up next to Yasha
you watch as the spiritual weapon flash happens
  hits

 Nice While the impacts of Beaus strikes
with the staff and the shurikens werent doing a
whole lot it seemed damaging but not anything as
hardy as you were hoping the Spiritual Weapon
comes down and seems to cleave it in half As it
separates and reforms itself you hear this
splashing and swishing of water it sounds almost
like a lowered angry growl
 All right Go ahead and roll Oh thats its
roll Its a
 Wisdom save That is a natural four so go
for it Damage
 Good round
 You watch as the impact of the cantrip
strikes it and the water seems to shake itself
around for a moment shifting as the sound
vibrations are forcing it to coast in a strange
design in its space That ends your turn
 All right That brings us to Fjord
 As youre pushing through youre seeing
certain things that are sunken in the water in the
corners Looks like bits of materials that have
either washed in through the water broken crates
and bits of wood things that gather in the edges
You push past them with your feet as you make it there
 The one that appeared behind the rest Go
for it
  Just hits
  misses So roll damage on the first
strike
 Five points of damage The Eldritch Blast
hits it and you watch as it creates this circle
in the center of its elemental form as it impacts
and actually strikes the stone behind with
whatever residual energy from the original impact
The hole forms up It took damage It didnt seem
to be as resistant as it had to previous blows
Magic seems to cut through whatever defense it has
 That ends Fjords Its now their turn
 This one who currently is engaged directly
with you is going to wisp around into the water
and emerge on the other side of Beau and is going
to go ahead and attempt to Whirlpool Strike you I
need you to make a strength saving throw please
 As it emerges you feel the water beneath
you begin to whip into a torrent and you are
swept off of your feet and knocked prone and are
considered currently restrained as it moves into
your space Its now currently swirling around
you and youre having a hard time moving Its
now forcing water into your mouth You cant
breathe in the moment You are whelmed by the elemental
 So that ends its turn The one over here is
going to go ahead because its closest to
Caduceus its just going to shift up into your
space get in contact with both you and Caleb and
its going to attempt to whelm you as well I
need you to go ahead it can only target one
person but I need you to make a strength saving
throw for me Caduceus
  Thats a success You feel the same
water swirling around your legs and you manage to
pull back and wrench your legs free as the torrent
comes to a slow crawl once more and the
creatures form emerges You can see the water now
forming these two large sledgehammerlike fists
that hang at its somewhat four
fourandahalffoot tall torso Thats going to
end both of their turns Caduceus youre up
 Not very well
 Pretty much not at all It is pitch black
You are considered blind
 As soon as you can see an enemy you will
release your Sacred Flame
 Okay so you can hear it and the focus of
this swirling splashing sound
 All right so Caduceus sidesteps Caleb
youre up
 All right so you move this way
 Okay its going to go ahead and take a
swipe at you with a slam attack That is a  to hit
 You suffer oh wow That is  points of
bludgeoning damage You get slammed in the lower
back the hip area and almost spin from the blow
of it but continue to stumble forward over to the
position you wanted to be
 All right Still restrained
 Correct
 All right So that is about as far as you
can get right there because Fjord is currently in
the far corner And Im marking you with
concentration just so I can keep tabs on that All
right so that ends Calebs go Nott youre up
 Go for it
 That hits
 Mhmm
 All right  points of damage on him nice
Because it is magical it bypasses the defenses
You watch as the bolt hits and theres a spark as
it impacts and for a second it seems to almost
lose its corporeal form then flickers back in The
bolt sinks down into the water below beneath the
kneelevel of the liquid that seems to consume the
entire chamber
 Which as a note guys those who have been
moving around I should mention it Ive been
keeping tabs under my own right Moving through
this is considered difficult terrain because you
are about knee to thighhigh in water and youre
having to basically wade through as you go
 Except for Nott whos standing above it
 Technically the Mariners Armor would give
you a swim speed So you can move through it at
your regular speed So you dont have to worry
about it That is correct
 Here
 Youll probably have to move a little
farther back to break sight from one of these
enemies but go ahead
 Okay
 Okay good to know
 Gotcha Yeah thats just an action
 Youre not quite No you wouldve had to
have been to go through if you werent affected
by a Suggestion spell
 Youre on the verge Like youre tipsy
 But youre not drunk All right that
finishes your go
 Yasha youre up
 Youve seen Beau suddenly grown to a larger
size but still being swarmed by the water of this
elemental form
 All righty
 You can try
 You can certainly try
 So you move up adjacent to Beau and the one
creature and what are you going to do Are you
going to attempt and pull her out
 Okay so you use your action I need you to
go ahead and make a strength check You have
advantage because you are raging
 Eight You go and grab and try to pull her
but unfortunately the water and sediment in here
has given a slick surface to the floor As you
pull your feet keep skidding across the floor
You cant get any sort of purchase and you cant
pull her out unfortunately
 Yeah you rolled Was that not with
advantage Roll again
 Okay hold on Youve been rolling the wrong
number of dice
 Oh well
 Good to know

 Keep that in mind for the future So 
will be enough So as your feet are slipping on
the ground you go ahead and take your sword and
jam it into the stone on the side and use that
With your other hand you get it underneath Beaus
larger arm and wrench her free from the creatures grasp
 So Beau you are still in this space a
little bit
 Youre still in the space of the creature
but youve managed to be pulled free from it So
youre still prone but you are not currently
whelmed by it
 All right that ends Yashas go unless you
want to move
 You pull your sword out of the wall and get
ready for the next round of combat This brings us
to the top of the round Beau youre up Jester
youre next
 Yeah yeah Make
 Yeah you can Which as you do its a
spray and spin windmill of water in the air around
it Go ahead and make your attacks
 Both hit
 Nine points of damage to it from the
spinning kick landing on the ground You are now
just barely midcalf in water but its also about
ten feet tall in here so youre having to hunch a
little bit Your head actually hits the ceiling a
bit Youre like 
 Okay
 I dont think you can spend a ki point to do
that Its just an ability you get to use
 Yes
 Immunities
 Vulnerabilities okay Its constitution
saving throw is a plus three Its not technically
a vulnerability but you do see that if it takes
cold damage it partially freezes which reduces
its speed
 Okay so the first one does hit second one
misses
 Ten damage Very good So with that as
youre standing there you go ahead and swing one
fist down and it strikes right at the center of
it and you watch as it separates for a second As
it reforms you go for another strike and this
time it manages to duck just out of the way
seeing the precursor of that strike and it dodges
entirely That finishes your turn
 All right That brings us to Jester
 All right
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Go for it
 Ill allow it
 So you roll an attack roll so a spell
attack roll ranged spell attack roll Thats
cocked yeah
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage for your
Guiding Bolt
  points of radiant damage to it In the
middle of this darkness theres this flash of
light and this streaking beam of radiant energy
that strikes and blasts into the elemental
Caduceus in that one moment your eyes suddenly
focus in on the glowing form almost in slow
motion as this elemental is slowly bursting from
the radiant energy and you see that moment
 All right so thats a wisdom saving throw
 Dex saving throw That is a  it fails
All right itll take the damage on that one
 Theyre both looking a little hurt and a
little aggressive Theyre now starting to get a
little frenzied That ends your turn Jester
 Actually yes because that wasnt an
attack roll Fjord youre up
 Okay
 Yeah she used Guiding Bolt
 There you go
 Correct So d
 Four So eight plus whatever the modifier
is Or its just d right Booming Blade is
still an attack
 Eight points of damage  It is
currently encircled by the booming energy
 All righty That ends your turn Fjord
 All righty Its now their turn So this one
here now low on health and a bit frenzied is
going to go ahead and take two strikes at the
enlarged Beauregard that has been its issue at
this time Thats going to be a  to hit and a 
to hit  and  naturally
 Oh my god Sam
 Its  points of bludgeoning damage to you
Beauregard For its being so small the short
bursts of impact it seems that in its harrowed
state its lashing out with all that it can The
other one is going to go ahead and attempt to make
a strike at Fjord and a strike at Caduceus The
one against Fjord is a natural one It goes to swing
out towards you and you hold the blade up and you
watch as it actually splits its extruding watery
arm across the blade It divides then splashes into
 Yeah Falls harmlessly onto the ground and
it has to reform a new pseudopod The other arm
swings back towards Caduceus
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 You pull up your shield and deflect it off
to the side No major issue there That finishes
their go actually no This guys going to go
ahead and move this ones going to go ahead and
shift over towards Jester is becoming a problem
Caduceus you do have an attack of opportunity if
you want to take one
 Correct yes
 Correct
 No worry there then That does not hit
That brings us to Caduceuss turn youre up
 Youre still blind
 You should
 Its a barrel
 You played Diablo you know how this works
Ting
 You got it Finishing Caduceuss turn
Caleb youre up
 All righty
 Hes a very prominent sorcerer or wizard
  does hit
 Nine points of acid damage to it As the
acid arrow strikes and impacts on its form
theres this splash of acidic liquid that actually
should I believe Beau also has to make
 Yeah it does take lesser damage from the
acid but it didnt have a lot of hit points left
So the impact is lessened However let me
doublecheck here for the acid arrow
 No sorry thats older systems Yeah no
That doesnt matter Older systems would do splash
acid damage but not in this one So yeah you
manage to pull out of the way as it falls back and
dissolves amongst the rest of it a little bit of
sea foam left behind in its wake
 All right Finishing Calebs turn Nott
youre up
 It is engaged with Jester yes
  As that one impacts you see it reaching
out with both of its fists towards Jester As it
strikes her its midsection just turns into bits
of foam and sea water as it splashes against her
armor and shield
 As you glance around keeping an eye out
make an investigation check
 Feeling through the floor and finding your
space in here you do not find any grates or any
other exits beyond the tunnel ahead of you the
tunnel you came from and the small grate on the
side But its high enough where the water doesnt
actually meet that level yet But you do see the
trailing signs of runoff and various bits of
minerals that have gathered and dripped out over
time to cause some discoloration to the stone
 Okay As Frumpkin pulls his way through the
tunnel slowly the tentacles unfurling and
dragging him forward through this slick somewhat
slimy algae grooved tube It goes on for about a
good  feet before it meets another grate
 All right so you cant watch at this
distance
 Oh you can view but you cannot give
actions
 So Frumpkin comes to this next grate Go
ahead and make a strength check for Frumpkin
 Its a three Frumpkin is unable to push
past that secondary grate and fighting with it for
a bit returns to you within range to communicate
and tells you theres no further to that tunnel
 The one that had to be there Go ahead and
make a perception check
 Its a lot of water ahead And some walls
 Oh on the smaller one you mean
 Make a nature check
 It breaks fairly easy The wood is very
soaked and warped And as your foot breaks through
it its now up to the knee inside of the barrel
Doesnt shatter youre now stuck with your leg
partially in a barrel
 Make an investigation check You eventually
pull your foot out of the barrel and look inside
In it the smell in there is of deep briny ocean
and possibly something that long rotted and has
since given this faint scent of earth and decay
 You feel your way around the exterior of the
column Glancing around you dont see any
particular signs of there being anything
different beyond the construction of the rest of
the chamber Nothing hidden no language or
discerning characteristics
 Correct
 Theres no grate its just another
continuation of the tunnel The same size of the
one that you entered this chamber from
 Yeah
 All right So whats the marching order
 We have Fjord in front we have Yasha behind
that
 All right Frumpkin goes on ahead
 Caduceus and Jester
 Notts in the back with Caleb all righty
 Thats right Little Beau is right there
 So Calebs in the very back
 Whos next Nott or
 Okay
 Okay So as youre making your way through
the water this puppy is trying to dog paddle from
the foot and a half of water 
 Roll an animal handling check
 Youre starting to get this connection
between you
 Blinks into your arm and you grasp it now
soaked in water It begins licking up your chin
and getting excited
 The two waterlogged pets right now are
flanking her throat What could possibly go wrong
 You didnt have to buy it
 Moving forward
 Make a perception check for Frumpkin
 In the octopus form
 Moving on ahead for about another  to 
feet down this long tunnel it opens up into
another chamber thats larger than the one you
were previously in It seems to curve open
slightly for about ten or so feet and then opens
even wider Its a large cubeshaped chamber the
same water level resting at about a foot foot
and a half up
 You see three grates that are similar in
size to the ones that blocked your entryway
Theres one on the right one on the left and
then one on the far end across from you where the
chamber seems to end However there are two
platforms that are raised up about ten feet above
with a very small railing and two pathways that
vanish further in Theres a raised two watch
points that protrude out and look over the smaller
part of this chamber
 Like balconies that protrude from the far
wall to overlook the interior of this chamber
 They push out about ten feet from the wall
before they come to an end So theyre more of a
 Yeah theyre not beautifully designed per
se Theyre made of the same stonework but they
look to be positions to supervise the interior of
the chamber
 Correct There is a very faint dull
tealgreen glow underneath the water in the far
center of the chamber
 There is also a faint mist that drifts over
the surface of the chamber in here
 Currently no movement no creatures
 Its similar about a foot and a half or
so
 Yeah Moving up to the very edge of it you
can see the interior of this chamber and the
display that Caleb had described Caduceus as you
guys are stepping up you hear this faint echoing
sound emerging from the upper left hallway You
see a very faint bit of light coming and you hear
talking
 No this is Caduceus
 Roll some stealth checks
 All right everyone make stealth checks
please
 You all quietly get low into the water and
off to the sides of the entrance to best stay out
of range of the light source You guys feel pretty
confident that you are for the most part out of
range of anyone who isnt fairly perceptive You
can see the faint dull glow from the center far
end of the chamber Now that youre closer and can
see there are two similar pillars in the center
of the room The last room you were in they were
just loadbearing center bits There are some
small elements of almost walkways or little bits
of stone that emerge from the far wall and the
corners that either rubble has built up or its
been intentionally built as some sort of platform
there Thats off the water
 At this point you see the light emerge from
that side and you hear the voice say The
complaints are driving me up the wall Zsundie is
going to get an earful if hes slacking on those
engines
 At this point you watch on the left side
the upper area holding a lantern Algar emerges
 Looks over the platform there flanked by a
worker of these tunnels whos wearing a simple
leather frock with gloves and is listening to him
and walking up beside His two dwarven bodyguards
are beside the two of them as they approach and
look over the side He looks over the edge the
small railing and looks into the water and goes
Oh hes sleeping Holds up his left arm and
begins this Zsundie Stand to attention you
frustrating water spout The glow begins to pulse
and the water bows a bit above Im going to
whisper something to you
 As the water bows up you see it burst like
a bubble and there emerging from that space below
where it was you see something that looks like an
impressively large aquatic humanoid their chest
and torso rather rotund their skin a bluegreen
color long thin arms that end in somewhat webbed
clawed fingers Their face somewhat fishlike
with a wide mouth and small fins that crest the
head The lower half of its body seems obscured by
rushing water at first but then as it comes to
its full stance at about seven eight foot tall
you notice that the lower half of its body is just
water Its a constant swirling whirlwind similar
to the creatures you were fighting in the previous
chamber That dull glow seems to emanate from most
of its torso in this darkened chamber and it
gives this faint light source by its very
presence
It has a small vest on and sets of jewelry
including this thick metal band that hangs like a
presentory necklace around its throat It turns
and looks up and says At your service It seems
to say with an undertone of exasperation and
eyeroll Algar screams out to it again The
Archway craftsman are complaining of cold furnaces
and slow bellows Please ensure enough water is
being spun through the engines into the district
He snaps his fingers really tightly on his left
hand With a low grunt of brimming hatred the
creature raises its arms and a large stationary
wave of water rises from the depths beside it The
liquid seems to form once more and theres a
slight sparkle of energy around its hands and
this second bowing forms into a large curved wave
that seems to be perpetually crashing and then
filling itself similar to the creatures you just
fought but a much larger scale It whips into its
full form and where the head would be bends and
shifts almost elements out of the movie The
Abyss as it turns toward this figure being
referred to as Zsundie It spins around and looks
up towards the supervisor and his troupe Thy will
is my bond The two of them begin to turn and
shift towards the left hand grate in the chamber
 Id say roughly  or so feet At this point
Zsundie comes to a stop and looks over his
shoulder in your direction and goes Oh
Intruders Algar shouts off What How and
holds up his lantern and focuses the beam over
across the way there You guys even though youre
up against the wall theres nothing to hide
behind The light pushes past a few of you and
then stops He shouts off Dispatch them
quickly
 Algar shouts it off to Zsundie down below
Lets roll initiative
 You will see in a second
 Excuse me for a moment of preparation here
 This is the difficulty of doing this
 I didnt know if you were This is the
difficulty of doing this in here
 I know thats all right We will fix this
guys
 And with that guys
 Id like you guys to place yourselves if
you can where you would be on this side of the
chamber as you enter There is Zsundie
 And there is the large elemental where you
had seen him The worker has run past and vanished
into the chamber before and there on the top
looking over the terrace the dwarven bodyguards
right there And thats Algar right there
 Yeah hes the tall one right there
 For that right there To Algar from you
Somewhere in the neighborhood of  to 
feet Youre not entirely sure
 Yeah roll for initiative guys
 This isnt working but thats fine
 Yeah Oh well
 Oh well Its fine Wonders of live Well
for the time being well just take this aside
Save it for another day
 I dont have time to troubleshoot right now
and tonights been moving quickly
 Its not misting
 Its all good So top of the line We have
here initiatives  to 
 Oh wow
 Okay got you
 All right  to 
 So
 Theres a faint glow from there but there
is not a technical light source beyond the lantern
here So this area is torchlight And then dim
light in that area So you can see most of the
chamber in dim light The closer you get to Algar
the better vision you have So we have Were
missing What is Caleb and
 All right
 All right Jester
 Top of the round
 Nott youre up
 Yeah youre up first
 It looks like you may be You might be just
out of range for  feet
 You can move a little closer if you want
 There
 Okay
 What are you holding Are you holding an
attack
 All right That ends your go Beau youre up
next
 Yes
 That is Algar The two dwarves are his
 Sure what do you want to do
 Sure You go ahead and you cast Mage Hand
 Now they think that I normally do this
 I dont think thats how its supposed to
work
 I did it I did a thing
 Thank you guys
 Move it forward for me Thank you Thatll
do
 I did a thing

 Thank you guys Now you get to fight it
 The little things really All right So
 Turn that down just a little bit there So
guys
 It was worth it for me It was worth it
Thank you for being patient on that one
 Beau what are you doing
 Okay go for it
 Make an acrobatics check If you want to
try With disadvantage because theyre slick
moist walls
 Ill allow you to make it as far as here
without using any movement
 Go for it
 Yeah thats good
 Lets say from there Its a lot of
movement but its also running off of walls that
dont really To land off of it youre going to
have to land this way Im thinking
trajectorywise
 Make a secondary acrobatics check because
youre now running off of two different walls
 With disadvantage yeah Because theyre
slick
 Yeah thatll put you at there with ten more
feet of movement
 Five ten No because youd finish your
space because youre in the water at that point
and its considered
 No because youd be occupying the same
space as Nott
 You can see Algar barely He has
threequarters cover
 There you go
 This is to Algar
 Both of them
 All right With threequarters cover thats
going to be a plus five to AC so his AC is
technically what were the two rolls
 The first one hits
 All right Actually yeah they dont have
a moment to react Cool so that ends your turn
 You throw both One ricochets off the other
one  Algar looks What the hell Get them
 That ends Beaus turn It is now the water
elementals turn Vanishes beneath the water
 Emerges right there
 Yeah next to Beau Its going to take two
slam attacks against Beau Thats going to be a
nine to hit
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 Both large giant slam fist towards hitting
the water causing these giant splashes but no
impact on you That finishes its turn that brings
us now to Zsundies turn Zsundie is going to go
ahead and angle over this actually hes going
to angle right where it is You watch as it brings
its hand forward and theres this tiny little
spiral of dull greenish energy that turns into a
jet of really fastpowered water that shoots out
in a foot line Yasha Caduceus and Caleb I
need you all to make dexterity saving throws
please
 Just in that line
 Yes
 Youre not raging yet no
 That will be  points of bludgeoning
damage You take half that so you take  but
thats  to Caduceus and  to Yasha Youre both
pushed  feet away and knocked prone
 Yes Caleb gets pushed back to there
 Actually no you are not pushed Caleb
 Yep which means they all slam into you You
actually hold that position Ill say for the
purposes of the narrative here you do get knocked
prone from their impact
 Yeah You all dont get shot out of the
room but all three of you are knocked prone on
the ground Caleb taking the brunt of two of his
larger teammates
 With that hes going to shift over into
this direction Thats going to finish his turn
Caduceus youre up
 Zsundie
 Zsundie
  Unfortunately thats as far as
you can get is right up against Yasha
 You dont know you have to eyeball it
 Its a little dicey
 Yeah because you used half your movement to
get up from prone
 Youre moving through the water
 Fjord youre up next by the way
 All right
 The beetles are swimming on the surface
 Oh yeah
 Theyre coasting over
 So right there
 Okay over there its harrying it so
 You can roll their attack if you want to
 Oh Its a
 Its okay Well get that fixed in the app
Its plus three to hit so go ahead and roll an
attack to hit
 That does not hit unfortunately But you now
have a swarm of beetles now here in this dark
underground area
 Okay
 Okay
 That finishes your go Fjord youre up
 Sure Yeah Because you dont have to worry
about that So you can go   is as far
as you can get
 It will get an attack of opportunity on you
as you move
 So as you rush by  reaches out
with a heavy
 Thats a natural 
 Oh because you have a reaction that can do
that Thats right
 You can
 Its an ability of the Grave cleric So
thats just a regular attack there So thats
going to be Zsundi Zsundi  points of
bludgeoning damage to you Fjord on the back of
your shoulder as you lunge forward but you make it
to your space
 It still hits as a natural  but its just
not a critical hit
 That would have been a little harsher So
what are you doing
 Youre up next Yasha
 It looks like its pretty close youd have
to give it a shot
 Oh its a bonus action Yeah 
 With the height that gets you right there
 That just hits
 That was with your staff or with your fist
 All right Its also halved
 Well now you know Youre remindedoh It
seems to resist nonmagical impacts
 No so yeah that would have been an attack
It takes six damage and the vulnerability goes
away So it does full damage
 Yeah but tactically youll figure it out in
the future
 Thats okay Now you know That brings us to
Fjords turn
 All righty Yeah thatll do it All right
So
 Technically you didnt even have to use your
bonus action to Misty Step there
 No when you using the action you teleport
yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within
range and immediately after you disappear
actually no the boom happens when you teleport
No youre right You did it right
 So where do you want to land
 You watch as Fjord teleports speaks for a
second and then where he vanishes theres this
blast of thunderous energy The moisture in the
air is evaporated from the impact causing this
faint misty orblike power like that Thank you
Taliesin
 Constitution saving throw to each of them
so go ahead and roll damage on that one
 Got you Thats cocked Thats a failure on
one of the guards So total  you said
  points of damage Failure on both
guards
 Algar does succeed though he rolled a 
He takes half damage
 They are pushed oh no they just take
damage
 Impact hits they almost slide off the side
and catch the railing and barely pull themselves
back into the space All right then is that your
turn
 That was nice
 Finishing Fjords turn Yasha youre up
 You are prone yes so you use half your
movement to stand up
 Whats your movement  right
  Yeah you can get there because
of your barbarian speed
 Go for it
  hits go ahead and roll damage
 All righty That was the first attack You
do that with your You have an extra attack you
can do two strikes
 Its okay
 Seven does not hit no You swing twice
First strike hits second one swings wide as it
dodges out of the way It seems like when the
first hit its head area where its head would be
splits in two ones still focused on Beau and the
other one curves around to look at you for a
second You see this dull glow where its sentient
eyes would be and is now focused on each of you
Does that end your turn Yasha
 All right That brings us to Algar Algar
having this happen goes Shit Protect me
Pulls out a potion and drinks it real fast
 Heals up a bit
 She threw a shuriken at him Hes going to
move up into this chamber a bit here
 Thats going to end his turn He doesnt
want to get too far away from his bodyguards That
brings us to Caleb
 There you do yes
 Go ahead and roll some damage Whats your
spell DC
  okay
 Failure on the first one
 Failure on the first bodyguard Success on
the second one
 Okay Algar does succeed Thank god
 However this blast of fire rocks the
interior of the chamber You watch as both of the
bodyguards  look up at
themselves You can see their skin is burned
in areas its cracked a little bit and they look
over towards Algar look out towards you and you
see him defensively moving back towards his
position
 All right that ends Calebs go Jester
youre up
 From there  Yes you can
 All righty where do you want it to go
 Here
 
 Yeah then you can do that there
 Heart eyes motherfucker
 Ooh a jagged lollipop
 Go for it
 Large fries motherfucker
 Go ahead and roll some damage on that one
 You dont actually see him so youre hoping
it hits across the wall
 Technically I should have given you
disadvantage because you cant see the target but
its fine Ill let it go through There you go
You hear  across the wall You have no idea
to what effect it was but you hit something
Probably Algar
 End your turn
 All right top of the round Nott youre
up Actually no the dwarves have to go still
The bodyguards rush over getting into the space
that thats there pushing past to the heads
this way This one is going to move back and you
dont know what this one does because hes moved
from your visual range but this one as it pulls
back it has a large heavy crossbow and its
going to go ahead and take a shot at you Jester
from back here Actually lets see No hes
going to shoot at Caduceus because Caduceus is
already wounded and wants to try and take down
those who are already hit Thats going to be
against Caduceus its going to be a  to hit
 All right You take nine points of piercing
damage
 Thats all the damage you take and then it
moves back and hides in this space here Thats
going to go ahead and end that go Now it is top
of the round Nott youre up
 Lets have a look here
 The hand can move  feet each time you use
it so it can move and do something
 Its right there yeah
 All right Go ahead and roll an arcana
check
 Yep
 Its less of a necklace and more of a large
metallic band that is around the neck like a
collar
 The hand reaches and grasps towards it and
pulls but its locked in place Theres no trick
to removing it that the hand seems to be able to
deal with but its a good thought
 It does not have reach with its slam so
no
 All right go for it
  hits go ahead and roll damage
 Nice  points of damage well done All
right that finishes your turn That brings us to Beau
 Step of the Wind lets you move as a bonus
action right
 Oh thats what it means gotcha So yeah
you can disengage You use a ki point your bonus
action to disengage
 Correct Up to you
 Whatre you doing Beau
 All right So its going to swing towards
you That is going to be an  to hit
 Whoosh just past you
 Okay its still your movement So if youre
wanting to leap off and parkour All right so
well say thats about  feet to get there Go
ahead and make an acrobatics check
 This is still disadvantage because its
slick
 Natural one So
 So you land and slip right into the ground
the water splashes youre underwater for a
second You use the rest of your Step of the Wind
extra dash movement to get up from prone Thats
your bonus actionYou still have your action and
movement
 All right 
 Ill say if you wanted to try and vertical
leap from here go ahead and make an athletics
check to see if given the circumstances of the
turn you can make it
  Ill allow you to just get the final
distance on the edge and have to correct yourself
and then catch it on the ledge But thats the end
of your movement there
 Towards
 You can barely see Algar just around the
corner Threequarters cover And then theres the
protector who looks fairly hurt
 I mean they all look pretty hurt the
Fireball wrecked their world a little bit
 No
 No unfortunately none of those hit So they
ricochet off the stone walls And your foot is
still slick from having to balance on the edge and
when you throw them both you have to compensate
and they both go wide But good try
 No thats it Thats your action bonus
action and your movement So the elemental is
going to whelm into Caduceus and Yashas spaces
 And its going to make
 Its going to make a whelm ability So each
creature in its space I need you both to make
strength saving throws You have advantage because
youre raging
 Thats a failure
  Thats a success So you are grappled
Until it ends you are considered restrained you
are unable to breathe and yeah thats it
currently So youre restrained grappled unable
to breathe
 You are pushed out of its space Yasha so
you are shoved out at a corner there You manage
to free yourself but Caduceus you now see is
swimming in this creature as its spinning around
its swirling like a giant water spout in the
center of the chamber And this guy here is going
to go ahead and move out into this space and
knowing what it summons its going to go ahead and
pull another water jet This one is going to go
ahead and shoot through what it thinks is you
passes through nothing but its going to go for
Caduceus and Caleb as well
 So this guy will move right up there
 Yeah it hits you So I need you both
to make dexterity saving throws The water
elemental has to as well And fails
 So thats  points of damage
 You cant retract
 All right so thats  points of
bludgeoning damage to you Caleb
 Youre unconscious but youre not making
death saves youre stabilized
 Yeah you are
 No hes face down
 I mean
 Well you can still drown with it on but
whats your constitution modifier
 Yeah you have like three minutes before you
drown sitting there So youre okay for now
Well say for just the purposes of like youre
not sucking air in necessarily
 Nah yeah youve convinced me out of it
Well get to it
 No thats right well go to constitution
saving throws on your turn All right so
finishing that
 Noticing that that is an illusion and seeing
you across the wall
 No its not So it turns away and goes
underneath here and glances up towards Beau You
see as it glides across the water at rapid speed
It seems to travel very quickly through any sort
of water surface and can jump quite a bit That
brings us to Caduceuss turn At the top of your
turn because you are still whelmed I need you to
make a death saving throw because you immediately
take damage as youre caught in the spiral of its
whelm So you would take d plus four bludgeoning
damage but you just instantaneously lose a death
save And its the end of your turn I need you to
make another death saving throw
 Thats a success
 No its only when youre using hit dice
during a short rest
 Fjord youre up
 What are you doing
 Okay so you can see the hallway behind here
that continues back
 All right so for that well say I finally
get to use these
 Hes used the ability before yeah
 And what do they have to make saving wise
 Go ahead and roll damage
 Seven points All right thats a natural 
for the first bodyguard so it takes three points right
 All right The other bodyguard Thats a
natural  And then for Algar that is a  so
he takes seven points of damage He goes
unconscious
 Not that you know that
 All right does that end your turn Fjord
 Okay step out to the point You got it All
right that brings us to Yashas turn
 Caduceus is being swirled around on the
inside his unconscious body just being kept with
the current So youre timing it for a moment and
go for a swing
 The beetles they just have their attack
increment They dont have the full action
spectrum
 No its just a straight roll
 So the first attack was what
 Oh it was cocked Okay
  hits So go ahead and roll damage for
that one
  points of damage on the first strike You
carve through you watch as a big piece of it
splashes away Its looking hurt Its not heavy
but youre starting to see some wear and tear on
the creature You make your second attack
 No it looks like hes still held in there
 No you dont have a means for getting
advantage Remember you have your reckless
strikes
 Is that what you wanted to do
 All right Usually you say that at the top
of the turn but its been a while so you can do that
 Its all good its all good
  hits yeah Go ahead and roll damage
  With the second carve carving through
you are now cutting away almost like its a
gelatin dessert and youre seeing the pieces
sloughing off of it It reforms back slowly but
its starting to sputter and bits of it are having
a hard time keeping itself as a full form You can
see foam gathering at the edges of it That
finishes your turn Are you going to move
 Thats right the beetles would have
probably clambered back into the staff when you
fell unconscious
 Sorry buddy
 Youre going to back up
 It will yeah
 So you just continue engaged and holding it
in that moment Okay that ends Yashas turn
Algar is going to make a death saving throw
Thats a failure
 All right Caleb your turn
 No make a constitution saving throw
 That is a six Were going to go ahead
and say that you are in the beginning stages of
drowning So you can survive a number of rounds
equal to your constitution modifier
 Two rounds yeah
 So you have two more rounds before you
drown
 Nope
 No yeah at the if you run out of breath
or are choking you survive the number of rounds
equal to your constitution modifier At the start
of your next turn you drop to zero hit points and
are dying
 It gets a little weird It gets a little
weird here Because youre stabilized Youre
stabilized by the necklace
 Kind of It gets a little weird
 It is yeah Well say
 Kind of So yeah youre stabilized
 And youre fine Physically
 Well see where it goes Well see where it
goes in two rounds
 All right That ends Calebs turn
 Jester youre up
 All righty
 Go for it
 Well Cure Wounds is still an action so you
cant do both in one round unfortunately
 Spiritual Weapon is still somewhere in those
tentacles but you cant see where that is
 Make an attack with disadvantage
 Well say that probably happens there
 Oh got you
 It unfortunately does not hit anybody
because of the the one that it strikes has a
higher armor class than  but
 Well no hes at two death saves
 Yeah
 Thats a melee attack that does that
 Okay That ends Jesters turn
 Yeah
 Okay
 Going past to get there the water elemental
gets an attack of opportunity on you
 He does
 Well now you know
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 He doesnt hit you
  You shrug it off from your armor
and shield
 Thats your full movement there
 All right does that end your turn
 That brings us to the compatriots here At the
top of their turn they take how much damage
 d Go ahead and roll d For both of the
dwarven bodyguards
 You can use your reaction to you can
yeah
 Well no if it didnt hit you I dont
think Does it say an attack or a hit I believe
it has to be a hit doesnt it When youre
damaged
 Gotcha So those left standing
 Just barely Full damage
 Oh dex save every turn
 A success and a fail no both successes
actually Both rolled really high that round All
right so two damage to each actually All right
and they cant see anything They both havent
moved since the last thing happened so one
reaches down and you hear some rummaging He gets
dragged
 Yeah
 Yeah no he cant drag him out of there
Its not enough movement for him to get in so
 Other ones just going to move into this
space here
 You hear some more rummaging You hear a
 What the fuck Thats it
 Sounds like Algars voice
 His bodyguards are prepped with a few
things Nott your turn
 Yeah
 All right
 Hes currently facedown floating in the
water
 So five
  There youll run back in the water
 No youre a little further away
 Thatll get you there You can probably get
him Its  feet from you there
 Mage Hand was here last
 Okay
 Okay Ill let that happen
 Sure Ill let you do that
 You watch as his unconscious body goes

 The sheer force of the vial being jammed
into his mouth Caleb make a strength saving
throw
 You do not break any teeth
 Damn it I was hoping having a crystal vial
jammed with that speed into your mouth there was a
good chance you were going to lose a tooth or
two
 So go ahead and roll heal for Caleb
 Was it a basic healing potion d plus two
 Heal seven hit points there you go
 That ends Notts turn Beau youre up
 Theres just a black sphere and occasionally
you see this dark strange grayish slimecovered
tentacles that whip out and back into the
 Move away from him right there you mean
 Okay got you
 Okay
 Got you Finishes your turn
 Beaus holding that Top of the round is the
water elemental Its going to go ahead and move over
 Its still carrying Caduceus along You get
to go ahead and make an attack of opportunity to
see if it shifts
 Because you have the Sentinel feat
 Ten does not hit Goes wide unfortunately
 Does reckless last until the end of your
turn or until
 Yeah but its out of her turn this is a
reaction Let me double check real fast
 During this turn it doesnt work towards
reactions unfortunately so swings wide Its
going to go ahead and move in Lets see if it
means yeah it gets its Whelm back Its going
to go ahead and move into Jesters space so now
both Jester and Caduceus are caught inside
 Its going to attempt to I need you to make
a dexterity saving throw
 So you are currently restrained Youre
grappled and restrained
 You take  points of bludgeoning damage
 So constitution saving throw
 Regardless that is a hold on what is the
save type on that
 Dexterity that is going to be a  Thats
 plus two Thats a failure I believe on your DC
 Oh because its a racial ability
 Oh yeah so no
 Takes half damage right
 Yeah reduces its speed by  feet until the
end of its next turn
  points of damage
 As it reaches and gets a little frozen and
its movement is a little sluggish Its looking
really hurt
  points of bludgeoning damage And because
technically Caduceus is still
 At the top of the turn No because you got
healed by Jester so you also take  points of
bludgeoning damage
 So thats going to end
 The water elementals turn Its now
Zsundies turn Zsundie is going to fly into the
air right up here
 And release another water jet through to
both Beau and Fjord I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws please
 You and Fjord
 You succeed Fjord You fail
 Its DC 
 So thats going to be  points of
bludgeoning damage to you
  points And ten points to you Fjord I
need you to make a constitution saving throw to
see if you maintain concentration
 You do you succeed And with that its
going to go ahead and continue flying coasting
around out of your range and turning his
attention towards the center column there
 No you do Im getting to that point right
now So on a success you are neither pushed nor
prone but you do 
  feet back technically so you would
 right in the ground there You
sploosh into the water and you are prone down at
the bottom again So that ends his go Caduceus
 At the top of your turn because you are
still whelmed you take seven points of bludgeoning
damage
 Staying in that water elemental is not good
news
 I know End of your turn make a death
saving throw
 Fjord your turn
 No you just drop the spell
 Yep
 To the water elemental Go for it And
youre not doing anything else right
 Roll your attacks
 You dont know
 Yasha hasnt had an issue with it yet
 Fjord then Yasha
 Okay As you drop Hunger of Hadar you can
see theyre both looking rather ragged and Algar
is on the ground coughing and sputtering as one
of the bodyguards is pulling and tosses an empty
health potion to the ground that shatters As soon
as it goes dark they both go Huh and all three
of them look at you Go ahead and roll attacks for
both the bodyguards
 That misses that guy
  does hit him
 Falls unconscious on the ground 
Hits the wall  and crumples into a pile
unconscious
 All right
    You can move right up into the
space right next looking down at Algar right
now End your turn
 Yasha youre up

 Go for it
  does not hit Thats with advantage
 Okay
 Second attack also with advantage Its for
all your attacks now
  does hit
  points of damage
 As you strike through with your final strike
the blade carves right up the side and like
cutting through a large wave it sprays up into the
ceiling and restores itself Jester and Caduceus
no longer being whelmed in it Youre still
unconscious your animals are no longer drowning
 This way
 There
 Finishes your turn Yasha
 Yes
 Is that an action just has you do it
 Then yeah you can do that
 Sure yeah
 You watch as this dark you guys dont see
this Algar looks to his left as the body of his
bodyguard which has been blown in the chest falls
over and immediately bleeds out and dies This
darkened shadow begins to tug and drag out of its
body You watch as this spectral ghost that has
faint barnacles and elements of dripping sea foam
and thick ocean water drooling out of its jaw
emerges and stands over going sinister
breathing
 Algar right now is If it wasnt so
generally wet in the chamber you could see the
puddle forming under him He is bludgeoned
beaten slimed within an inch of his life and is
looking at the specter looking at you and is
like 
 For his turn he is going to cower He is
just going to put his hands up and try and drag
and put his back against the wall and is just
sputtering unable to make a word That brings us
to Calebs turn
 Its a spell of firstlevel or higher and a
cantrip
 There is a feat you can take at level eight
to do what you did in the last campaign
 You can move Ill say two squares
 To there you mean
 Okay
 Back corner of the room here you mean
 Okay Yeah you can do that
  for his dexterity saving throw
 Go ahead and roll damage He takes half
damage
 All right First damage to Zsundie
 As the flames subside and pull back
the evaporated water in the vicinity turns into
this cloud of mist that  around Steam
fills the upper chamber for a minute And as the
steam pulls away from Zsundie barely scathed by
the Fireball  just glaring right at you
Caleb
 You got it That ends your turn Jester
youre up
 All righty
 Nice
 Yep You cant see whats around there
yeah
 So make an attack with disadvantage
  hits the other bodyguard Go for it
  Argh And you watch as two
armored feet  on the side The other armored
guard collapses on the other side Algars seeing
this specter rising this drowned wraith emerging
from one bodyguard and the other bodyguard
 on the ground next to him Looks up at
Fjord just stepping over and walking towards him
in the far corner
 So that would be  right there
Wading through the water as you get over All
righty That ends your turn Jester Nott youre
up
 Algar Algar is
 Szundie
 Make a persuasion check
 Unmoved your words fall upon deaf ears as a
focused semiethereal waterbased elemental
entity is steady his eyes filled with driven
command and murder Anything else you want to do
 Hes thinking about it Hmm
 Okay Go ahead and curl around there Go
ahead and make your stealth check
  all right You feel sufficiently hidden
Beau
  There
 Your bonus dash will get you a full jump
You can get about there with your full movement
with the half lost from the prone
  Youre in the chamber now with
Fjord As you round the corner you see the one
recently crushed dwarf the other has this drowned
wraith pulled out of its body this specter
looming over Algar And you see the back of Fjord
standing over Algar whos  on the ground
scooting away
 Okay Hes now pinned against the wall your
knee against the jaw and the chin hes choking
against the pressure
 Make an athletics check
 Eh
 You had to remember Make an athletics
check
 Make an athletics check to grapple
 Yeah he is fully grappled by you and shoved
against the wall That ends your go
 It is now
 Szundies turn
 Szundie
 Yeah It makes sense Szundies going to go
ahead and lower down and see the hobbling Caleb
making his way up through the water and
Caduceus
 Still a fivefoot line though
 Yeah youre still in the space
 Its not like a little tiny stream its a
big  I need you both to make dexterity
saving throws Because you are prone
 No it doesnt affect your saving throw So
yeah
  success
 Success So that is ooh thats a good
roll
 Thats
  So thats  points of bludgeoning
damage to each of you
 Caleb goes out and gets pushed  feet back
again  Whoa way into the back there
Caduceus is like Argh But youre still holding
on at this moment And it is going to go ahead and
appear right next to you holding this trident
now that apparates in its hand and its rearing
back to go ahead and start
 All right Caduceus Youre conscious
 Cure Wounds is a touch I believe
 Healing Word is the
 All right d plus your wisdom modifier
 Thats right Grave clerics man
 All right
 All right So well say for purposes of this
right now you get up turn invisible
 Okay yeah You turn invisible get up and
then you want to move You can move two squares
well say
 Fjord
 Hes like  He cant do
anything But you can see the bracelet right there
on his wrist
 What do you want to do
 With being grappled coup de grace just
go ahead and roll an attack just for the hell of
it With advantage
 With a sparking grinding noise you all
hear echoes as the blade carves across the stones
and you watch as a splash of water it looks
almost like a water razor just  through
the area and the hand just falls off onto the
ground The bracelet slips off of his wrist and
hes  and is now screaming
against the guttural pressure placed on his
throat In that moment you watch as Szundie the
trident goes limp disappears from his hand Just
gives you a look turns around and then begins to
drift up in the direction of where Algar is And
thats where were going to end tonights

 Welcome back Last we left off The Mighty
Nein had found their way outside of the Dwendalian
Empire and to the first city along the coast of
the Menagerie Coast Nicodranas where Fjord had
passed through previously on his various
adventures through the waters nearby and Jesters
upbringing was entirely within You had met with
Jesters mother Marion The Ruby of the Sea as
well as began to seek information about an
individual that was connected with your time up at
Shadycreek Run and the sphere that you had
absorbed Fjord In this period of time you
discovered there was an individual that had grown
jealous and strangely aggressive regarding the
companionship of Jesters mother and as such you
began to seek information about them in a way to
put an end to this behavior In doing so you went
to a tavern and met a captain who had possibly
room for a few of you to travel with about a week
from now You met a tortle for many of you the
first time youve encountered a tortle who had
some interesting things to say and a lead on the
individual you were looking for You also found
information about whats called the Sluice Weave
a series of waterways beneath the city where this
Algar this individual that was creating tension
with The Ruby of the Sea works and oversees You
made your way to the outskirts of the docks
searched through the water for an entrance
managed to muscle your way through the grates
below nearly drowning the pets you had recently
purchased You encountered a few small water
elementals and eventually came upon one of the
nexus areas of this waterway where there was an
elemental entity named Zsundie that was bound to
this location and was helping run and control the
water in and out under the supervision of Algar
Catching them but however not being as stealthy
as you had hoped you were noticed and as such a
battle commenced where Zsundie this elemental
figure was given the command by Algar to take
care of you and see you out In this fray a
number of you fell and fell again but through a
combination of Fjords teleportation spell
abilities you guys keeping each other alive you
repeatedly punching very hard whatever got in your
way you managed to subdue Algar destroy his two
guards raised one as a specter and noticing that
there was something affixed to his wrist that
seemed to have some connection with Zsundie Fjord
cut his left hand off And thats where we pick
up The rest of you are slowly pulling your way
your bodies are completely waterlogged from
rushing through thighhigh waters and many of you
being submerged nearly drowned at times You
gather yourself as you realize the threat is gone
The water elementals destroyed and this entity
that was once attacking you seems to have lowered
their trident and turned around their attention
elsewhere releasing any aggressive demeanor they
have held since your arrival At this time you
Beau as you turn the corner and mashed the face
of Algar against the wet stone wall you look over
to see both Fjord slice the hand off of his right wrist
 Oh sorry left hand Its to your right
You see the left hand get cut off He screams out
bleeding from the stump as he grabs it with his
other hand the hand and the bracelet that was
attached both clattering to the ground with a wet
thud and it  falling over to the side
Beau you also look over and notice there is this
horrible strange undead entity floating
immediately to your right of you and Algar this
spectral creature that is ethereal but made of
dark blue and black energy this drowned spirit
that is giving off this horrible guttural sucking
sound and Fjord still stands there blade in hand
looming over the two of you technically
 Yeah you guys know where they went but you
have no idea whats transpired since Currently
Zsundie is floating towards the back of the
chamber towards where they are What do you do
 Okay You pick the bracelet and Algars
like 
 Make an intimidation check with advantage
 Yeah It was part of my post What are you
going to do Please dont kill me Please
 At this point Zsundie appears at the back
of the chamber Rounding the corner the large
thick barrelchested fishlike form wearing this
very welltailored vest with the silks of the
shirt billowing around its wet elemental form its
fish face curled into this sly grin It spins
around and looks towards Algar and you guys It
says with this low burbling fish voice Ah I
see the hour is nigh for vengeance It pulls the
collar from its neck and it clangs onto the ground

 It puts out its hand You have seemingly
come to the aid of this humble individual Please
hand me the implements of my enslavement
 That is not of your concern
 Algars still  Dont trust him
 The rest of you are closing up on this
space
 You guys leap up and begin to climb In the
meantime the creature looks to you and says
Lets just say that there were powerful minds
that were interested in the benefits of my
undivided attention towards things that were of
not my interest
 Catches it picks up the necklace and both
of them get tucked inside of its vest with this
heavy wet sucking sound Looks over to Algar It
would appear that you have this taken care of but
would you do me the honors
 Hes bleeding out
 Yeah you guys all now have gone into the
chamber You can see this
 Hes definitely passed out Hes not dead
but there is a large amount of blood coming out of
his severed stump
 Make a medicine check
 Thats enough to stabilize okay Youve
prevented him from bleeding out He looks pale and
has lost a lot of blood and there is this dark
pool thats still suffusing the space around him
on the stone floor on the raised area of the
hallway So hes stable Zsundie as the rest of
you came around the corner you can see him
standing there looking at the group Well I have
things to take care of now It looks to you
Ketiv Zsundie is my title Ive been held here
for too long Should you find yourself among the
endless seas of my world come to my Silversilt Palace
 There I shall reward you for your
assistance Now Ill go to free my partner
 Thats a good question and it leaves
 Okay
 That is a  whats your DC
 Whats your spell DC
 The specter goes  and immediately
turns around and starts drifting down the hallway
away from you giving this horrible hollow sucking
scream
 Yashas with you
 She was making her way towards the sea but
hasnt made passage anywhere
 Okay
 I like that a gortle
 There you go Tortle Skirts
 Jester needs to get out more
 Okay
 As the wave of healing divine energy
emanates from Clays focused point Algar whos
still being held against the wall by Beau

 Okay all right
 That is 
 Okay so he succeeds
 You can try it again if you have another ki
point
 Oh wait no let me see I think he might be
immune to it for the next  hours based on the ability
 If he succeeds on it yeah I think so
 Well Im going to double check here but I
think if he succeeds in the save hes immune to it
for  hours I could be wrong Let me double
check here
 Yeah you can wait  hours and then come
back to it
 Make an investigation check please
  okay Rifling through his bits you find
 gold pieces  silver pieces two platinum pieces
 You find one empty glass vial where a
healing potion was used previously A dagger and
a basic hand crossbow with five bolts
 Perfect
 He does attached to the shirt if you want
to pluck them
 There are six buttons
 No youre fine To Extort Truth no you
can continue to try it if you want to
 All right With every more button pulled

 Button  Button Youre teaming up
on this regard
 Okay thats a failure Thats a natural
ten Okay you slam his head two more times and
pinch an area underneath the bottom of the jaw It
causes his irises to swell for a little bit He
looks towards you head lolling a little bit
 He doesnt answer but you have his
attention
 Its my job I was assigned as the
supervisor of the Sluice Gate
 I report to the Clovis Concord I was
assigned here maybe a few months back from Port
Zoon but I largely specifically report to the
Marquis and his associates
 Marquis Ze Fuldan
 No
 Hes resisting answering
 Make an intimidation check with advantage
because you have him affected with the Extort
 In his current position he
 The Margrave and the Concord are
aware This is one of two cities that runs with
one of these marid underneath 
 Yes
 Port Damali
 With the muscles popping
 I drink and carouse buy fine linens and
furniture
 Yeah You asked what he does with his spare
time
 None really I take companions The Ruby
is a very beautiful creature
 A few more weeks of wooing her yes
 Theres a conflict inside where his
masculine pride immediately hits with the hit to
his ego that you just delivered
 My job
 To maintain the Weave To help exert my
will on the creature that you just freed so it
can direct water towards the various furnaces that
run a lot of the engines that help maintain some
of the commerce here in the city
 Oh I fucked it up Well thanks to your
interference here theyre probably going to have
to renetwork everything through analog means
Thatll take weeks Itll be expensive
 You hear his head hit the stone once more
Who the fuck are you
 Make an intimidation check with advantage
 He looks down at his severed hand the stump
having now healed over from the healing power of
your prayer Look please I dont want to die I
dont want to die down here I dont want to wash
up in the middle of the shore
 That sounds like a great idea
 He nods Right yeah Ill go Ill leave
immediately Just please let me go
 Same way I come in every day Yeah Ill
show you out
 Its not on her its up in the boat you
guys had put in the water She goes Mostly just
blankets and gold
 Right
 Jorge Hes still trying to pull away from
the horrible slow sucking of
 Oh the tentacles wrapping around the neck
and theres a slight biting right there
 He sits there held to the wall being
chewed on by a tiny octopus for the next 
minutes while you roll Okay roll for your
disguise kit
 Not with advantage but you get proficiency
bonus so roll a d add your dexterity modifier
 Algar looks like a weirder uncle of Algar
who could probably pass for a Jorge sure yeah
But he looks different and is missing a hand so
its definitely not Algar
 No no traps There are some lockdown
failsafes but its not much help at the moment
 He gives you a look that doesnt nod but
you can see from his recognition that you hit the
nail on the head
 He looks to Beau to be let up because hes
still being pressed
 He gets up  Still looking over the
missing hand and back at the rest of you and
begins to slump his way further down the hallway
where they were heading to exit Youre following
him down this path Hes using a small torch that
he lit for light to make his way down here and as
he leads you through it opens up into a few other
small chambers that have some tables and chairs
Theres a number of weapons closequarter smaller
weapons for any combat that may take place in a
tunnel Theres a small sketch with charcoal or
some sort of a darker chalk on the wall that
outlines the layout of the Sluice Weave for those
that are coming in to see where theyre trying to
go and get to
 Yeah yeah you do Its part of it now
 There you go Eventually he leads you to a
spiral staircase that goes upwards There are two
sets of iron barred doors he has the keys to He
opens them leads you in You do notice on the way
through there are a couple of archways leading
from chamber to chamber where there are gated
portcullis doorways that would collapse down
There are switches on the opposite side as a means
of defense if things were to go wrong to back up
Once you have them under your control he has no
means of doing so and you watch him very
carefully Heading up the spiral staircase it
leads you to a trap door that a stair leads up to
He pushes it open quietly and it leads you into a
small office Its got a small desk its got a
stool its got some odd stacks of paper looks
like theres a quill and an inkwell a second
unopened inkwell Theres some partially melted
candles that arent lit at the moment and there
is a door that exits He unlocks that door
 I understand
 This is my office yeah
 The few that I work with yes
 Make an investigation check
 You glance through quickly A lot of it
appears to be notes on repairs on how best to
organize the time that the marid has There is an
actual breakdown on how often it can summon
elementals and control them You find some things
that talk about a marid defense of the city
meaning there is a plan in place that if ever the
city were under attack from the sea that it was
one of their secret weapons to defend the city
from ships Thats the most you can find Those
are all surface things that you see on the desk
The rest of it doesnt seem to make much sense or
pertain to anything important to you
 A few of them He points to a couple
 I was lefthanded
 Make an investigation check
 Looks like an office
 Thats fine
 His stare is far off in the distance He is
looking down the barrel of a gun and a complete
shift in his life that he wasnt expecting to take
immediately His responses are very oneword and
very No
 You escort him to the wharf As a sailor
you know specifically who to talk to to secure
passage under the table Where do you want to send
him
  Its a good summer stayaway
 Yeah thats one of the major coastal cities
on the eastern side of TalDorei
 All right Because its a longer journey
its a little more expensive but you can secure
passage for him to Marquet for well say 
gold
 This is very kind of you
 The beards peeling a little bit Hes just
staring at the coin in his palm
 Adella leaves in little under a week You
can secure passage today on a small ship thats
heading back to Marquet You send him off on his
way You wait another hour or so to make sure the
ship disembarks and he doesnt abscond from the
ship itself You watch as it begins to make its
way towards the horizon and you feel confident
that hes not going to be coming back anytime soon
 Eight
 Heres a question Did you dismiss your
specter or do you have a
 As you guys are
 As youre leaving the area right behind you
is this  What do you do with it
 Yeah Its following you
 You guys begin to watch as that same drowned
specter is now coming back behind you 
 It turns right around and runs off a bit
 Its frightened of him and runs away
 Correct It doesnt last a long while A
short time passes and it just
 You already have
 Well you checked around for anything that
would be interesting so
 
 How many Channel Divinities can you do
 I feel like you were out last time Well
say you took a short rest but Its wandered
back in the chamber and its looking at Fjord

 Turns around and starts walking away
  The specter returns as
you guys are having this conversation
 All right Go ahead and make an attack
roll
 Okay
 Thats  so it takes damage Thats
basically what this is
  points of radiant damage All right

 Success
 Its not attacking anyone
 Its not assaulting you guys Its just
standing there and taking the hits and looking in
pain It keeps looking for Fjord

 It disperses into shadow and vanishes
 This was me realizing that this is what
would have happened earlier so were taking care
of it now Okay Because this would have been
following I forgot about the specter briefly
earlier and this would have happened
 I appreciate that theyve completely glossed
over this scenario
 Well say that you guys are all together
 Go ahead and roll for your forgery kit
 With proficiency so d plus Ill say
this is for intelligence
 Okay so you have a fragment of
possibility
 Im saying because its a forgery and its
having to pay attention to details Im going to
say intellect Intelligence
 Yeah
 You dont have to roll twice You dont have
to spend it if you dont want it
 Plus three I think
  Pretty good forgery Youre proud of
yourself It looks pretty spoton based on his
handwriting Youve followed his cadence his
sentence structure His signature looks incredible
 Yeah
 Ill say with your strength you can easily
do so It will break the quill technically but
it still pierces it to the door There you go
 Cool so the letter is complete and placed
 Yes were Okay This is my fault for
forgetting one feature earlier and trying to fit
it into the narrative here Order of business You
arrived you forged a letter
 You saw a weird undead thing again that was
following you and then Fjord made it go away with
a hand wave You then took Jorge to the docks and
sent him on his way
 You guys are near the docks youve made
your way out
 Okay Its still there floating You can see
theres one fisherman whos eyeing it curiously
 Okay You go ahead and make your way out
get up on the side of it and begin to row
yourself back to the edge of the dock There not
far away is the old fisherman you had spoken to
earlier that you had borrowed it from You gather
your things out of it and he comes over and is
like Well I appreciate you bringing this
back
 No such thing No such thing
 You too tall one
 Make a perception check
 It looks like the city I mean at this
point in the day its getting a little later The
sky is starting to get a bit maybe the oranges
of dusk are starting to peek in a little bit You
maybe have another hour or so of daylight
 Make a perception check
 Currently no You dont see him anywhere
 Yeah you dont know
 Yeah I mean occasionally hes out there
looking for work Thats as much as Orly knew
 Marius
 No Sabian you heard about through Fjord
 You got some information about Sabian yes
 Yeah that was through Captain Adella
 Its close to dusk About an hour of
daylight left
 Okay Its a little bit of a roundabout
walk but you can do it All right so you make
your way back to the Open Quay Heading towards
the tower you can see as you approach based on
whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision
you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get
to it to the point where its massively towering
when youre right below it Still no sign of a
door at first glance You still have the
footup or so balcony and a few other windows
up that way You can see the top two windows have
now that its gotten darker you can theres a
little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of
it
 Make an arcana check
 Make a perception check
 Ten You assume its either some sort of
spatial enchantment to it or its an illusion
maybe Thats as much as you can make out from
it
 Natural  The city doesnt appear to be
heavily changed by any means
 You do notice that where previously there
were some plumes of white smoke or steam that rose
from certain more industrial aspects of the city
are much thinner appearing to be more residual
columns of steam and smoke
 Youre at the tower The Tide Peak Tower
Anything you want to do
 Yep
 Yussa Errennis
 Make an intelligence check to see if you can
overlay the memory of the sketch you saw with the
location in the Quay
 Yep
  You feel like youve been able to take
the two and map them together pretty well Nothing
passes directly beneath the tower no The Sluice
isnt a wide network Its a handful of
deliberately placed tunnels to make their way
towards specific parts of different districts
 All right By the time you make it to the
Lavish Chateau it is sunset The last bit of
light that vanishes over the horizon far over the
ocean the Lucidian Ocean in the distance You
make your way to the interior where a number of
folks have finally gathered Maybe a handful six
or seven people are already in there enjoying
meals having drinks You know that there isnt a
performance tonight but people are in there
enjoying the relatively comparably classy
atmosphere as the familiar band plays their
music What do you want to do
 Good call
 Okay
 All right You guys make your way up to the
third flight You missed him last time but you
come upon the familiar sight to you which was
your mothers personal bodyguard for half of the
time at the Chateau Bluude
 Which was also responsible at times to watch
you and escort you when you went to the city The
rest of you are caught offguard by the sight of
this massive dualhorned minotaur
 Wearing a very very fine shirt but is
Donald Ducking it the rest of the way Thankfully
relatively thick thick fur down there Youd have
to pry to get a good look But is standing there
arms crossed and goes Oh Jester He comes
over and picks you up Actually no he wouldnt
recognize you because youre a tortle
 Probably not Not unless you say anything
 Now we go into the Oh Jester There we
go thats the moment
 Right right
 With a D
 Of course I assume that is the case He
knocks on the door At that point the door opens
up a bit and peeking through is the Ruby of the
Sea Marion whose hair is perfectly curled even
without an evening performance She smiles at the
sight of all of you at the door and looks
curiously at the large skirtfaring tortle
Hello
 Not at the moment no
 Oh Jester Hi Yeah please do come
inside everyone Come on You all make your way
into the chamber
 Okay She shoos out her servants and the
door closes
 She has not Shes like Oh my goodness
It is so nice to meet you Yasha She shakes her
hand and Yasha awkwardly Hi and looks to the
rest of you and leans towards the back wall and
crosses her arms Not one for social graces
necessarily but seemingly looking at Marion
looking at Jester looking at Marion and can see
the relation Marion sits down in front of her
mirror and her little table set up in the corner
spins back towards the rest of you Welcome back
There is no performance tonight I apologize but
if you would like us to provide food for you or
whatever you like please do not bother to let me
know
 There are a number of guys that I know
yes
 Algar yes
 He left
 Huh Well that may very well be a great
turn of luck in my benefit definitely Thank you
for looking into that
  Well that makes me feel more
comfortable thank you very much
 I appreciate it
 Very well I will ensure that you are all
properly taken care of this night clapping
twice She goes ahead and brings the servants back
in A meal is placed for the rest of you and as
the evening progresses and you take a bit of time
to rest
 Yeah go ahead and take a short rest You
guys manage to enjoy probably one of the better
meals youve had in a while
 You guys are eating downstairs Theyre not
bringing room service up into her chambers
 Not at the moment no
 You hear the heavy footfalls of Bluude
making his way down the stairs and goes and finds
a corner just to keep an eye Then Marion now
dressed in her casual evening gown which in
itself is still regal and beautiful and trails
behind her up the stairs as she descends comes to
join you at the table and sits She smiles at the
rest of you and gives a renewed nod to Yasha whom
she just met Well I am very happy to see that
youve made a good group of friends a travel
family Just warms my heart
 Is everything all right
 Not in the slightest Jester this is no
imposition Im just happy to have you home for a bit
 How long do you intend to stay
 I have a friend who had a similar problem
years ago If you would like there is a physician
we could have take a look at you and see if we can
a way to no longer have that problem
 Ah young Jester was rambunctious curious
ever running off getting into well trouble and
finding trouble making trouble For me it was a
joy She was very quick to learn ever smiling
brightening any chamber she walked into She had a
good sense for who needed to be taken down a peg
 Very much so more so around adolescence I
think
 But she has always been sweet
inspirational
 Very proud of her
 Yes but not anything I can speak of in
mixed company
 You guys are in the downstairs in the main
tavern area of the Chateau
 I agree
 Its a big old cast iron tiki mask with
giant tusks oof All right
 Curious choice but I understand probably
for the best There is not much of a mouth hole
so eating is going to be very difficult Takes a
little spoon and is like All right here we go
try to make it there it is Perfect You guys
talk for a bit She shares some embarrassing
stories of Jesters childhood Asks each of you a
little bit about your story and well say for the
better part of the evening its an enjoyable
respite from the chaos of the day and the chaos of
the journey Your blink dog has dried as has your
weasel
 You can and as you go ahead and find
there is a coat room essentially where the young
man who had originally met you when you got there
is inside You can see him sitting in the back on
a stool going like this Hes staring in the far
way and theres a coat rack where Professor
Thaddeus is sitting on there staring at him As
you enter the chamber
 Oh hey
 You can see theres some scratches on his
cheek Yeah hes fine Just watching him right there
 I think not Hard to feed these
 Roll an animal handling check
 He dives towards you and goes right over
your shoulder and is now in the middle of the
central tavern  The leather cord of
his leash is now dangling as hes up in the
rafters 
 Everyone in the chambers like therere
people that are eating who are like What the
Theyre all staring up at this owl that has now
found a brief perch up into the roof chamber
 Squeaks like a balloon
 Youre holding the beetle
 Make an animal handling check
 Eventually it dives down snatches and a
little prick on the finger from one of the
talons but eventually makes a quick meal and
heads back up
 Yes
 Of course To be honest Ive been thinking
about maybe having a pet so this will be good training
 Well since youve been gone you know
 Theyre interesting definitely
 I imagine that it is how is it special
This sounds like a warning
  It appears on your chest and catch it
for a second Shes like Oh my
 That is as tricky as perhaps the daughter
that I have
 
 Youre home
 Oh I am your home
 Immediately she goes Heh and pets him
over the table
 Yeah its getting close About  

 All right
 Make one more animal handling check
 Eventually seeing this command 
comes to rest onto your wrist
 Okay You guys make your way through the
streets heading towards where
 Yeah well theres the Restless Wharf and
theres the Open Quay
 The place that you had heard this
information
 You didnt get any specifics he just said
near the docks but you were in the Restless Wharf
when you got this information
 All right Whos helming a lookout
 Yeah There are torch poles set up towards
the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light
but other than that its not a full moon but
its mostly full and theres quite a bit of
moonlight coming down over the dock You can see
it glittering across the water in the center of
the harbor There are a number of ships quietly
set out in that vicinity The starclustered sky
completely envelopes the air above you Its a
beautiful view The closer you get to the docks
you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out
of view the creaking of wet wood filling the air
as the docks shift and the number of boats that
are currently moored to the center of the harbor
creak from side to side as the water comes in
Every now and then you see the slow glowing beam
of the Lighthouse pass overhead about once a
minute or so Its a very slow moving pulsing
rhythm Now ships of varying sizes sit across the
dock spread tied to their various posts all
seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber
Theres no one doing any sort of evening work on
these ships at this hour You see a handful of
zolezzo patrolling up and down the sides of the
dock doing their rounds no urgency or direction
necessarily Make a perception check if you dont
mind Clay
  jesus Okay then You
 You watch out for one of the westernmost
docks of the district to see a shady figure
darting between patrols Watching as the zolezzo
will pass and then use that moment to dart across
the street and wait for the next zolezzo to pass
and then make their way over to the edge of the
wharf You see them now ducking near a stack of
empty shipping crates and they wait every now and
then glancing over when a zolezzos not nearby or
looking towards one of the darkened ships that is
anchored towards one of the dock extensions not
that far from one of the docking cranes thats
left still after an evening of offloading from one
of the other ships
 You do watch as a zolezzo holding one of
their portable torches and a sheathed sword
glances over in the direction of where that shaded
figure is Steps towards it and holds the torch up
and begins a soft call out Hello The shaded
figure stands up and approaches hands open
smiling Getting a better look you do see finer
elven features a lighter ashy hair thats short
on the sides and flopped in the front who
approaches talks briefly You cant really hear
what theyre saying its hushed but puts
something into the hands of the zolezzo The
zolezzo takes a moment nods and then turns around
and leaves his post
 The figure goes and then darts back behind
the crates once more and keeps looking over
towards that one single ship thats about  or 
feet from where hes sitting
 Make a stealth check with advantage
 Okay You make your way over to the side of
the docks on the opposite end and theres a little
step up from this edge of the street and you have
a few buildings begin to give way The road ends
and there are bits of it that break off and fall
off the short cliffs into the water Theres the
docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of
the dock thats out of the way but its blocking
a lot of the view on this side The ship that this
figure is focused on and the crates that hes by
on one side You get to the other and keeping
quiet You dont think youve been noticed
 Make a perception check
 Youre waiting Not much else seems to be
going on
 Okay You just sit there and wait
 Okay The rest of you doing anything
 Okay
 Mmkay You begin casting that Caduceus as
this is happening there are a few of those torch
poles set up and theres one at each dock nexus
The one by that ship the light flickers out
 You dont see that and youre not close
enough to hear any of this You see as a handful
of figures seemed to have come out of that ship
walked across the gangplank and put that
torchlight out
 Make a perception check for you if you want
to glance or are you asking Caduceus
 She cant make out details and even from
this distance you cant make out a bunch because
theyre all wearing either full cloaks or half
cloaks that end right about just past the elbow
Hoods up Not uniform Patchwork in color and
make but theyre all obscuring their features intentionally
 Nott you watch as the figure thats waiting
stands up out of the spot looks around looks
that theres no zolezzo currently patrolling at
the moment and begins now to step onto the dock
and walk towards the figures on the ship
 Okay Goes and approaches The figures
theres now two that have stepped up to meet and
you can see now there are a few more that are
still in the ship that are watching from
 Its a fair size Id say from tip to end
its about  or so feet Single sail but a big sail
 Its currently furled up It looks like its
a ship thats designed for speed more than cargo
but its a decentsized ship
 The dock as youre walking continues
forward and then it turns a little bit at an
angle and there are other ships that are docked
Theres a smaller fishing ship on one side
theres a rowboat thats set off in the water
there Its facing towards you at an angle and is
currently anchored at the edge of where the dock
turns to the right There is a gangplank set out
between that and the dock where the figures are
stepping up Theyre meeting right where that
gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed
 All right Go ahead and make a
How do I want to do this
 There you go I walked into that one Make
an acrobatics check for me Fjord
  The figures all of a sudden all
stop and turn as well as the one who was talking
and they all look in your direction
 Thaumaturgy its not so much an audio
mimicry spell but you can make certain sounds
happen so Ill say roll a performance check
 

 It seems to not assuage their fears and more
make them more worried and curious as to whats
happening You watch as the two figures there
start looking over towards the initial figure that
you were following and are looking really
aggressive towards them The figures hands are up
and are like  Theres this heated
conversation going The figures in the ship are
getting things at the ready that you cant see
but it looks like they are very much on guard The
two that were talking one of them grabs the
scruff of the figure and holds him there while
the other one blade drawn begins to approach the
edge of the dock where that noise came from
 Make a deception check
 Make a deception check with disadvantage
 As you give this display the figure with
the sword out that was looking for the edge of the
water where Fjord was looks over at you and goes
with the little bit of features you can see a
chin a scruffy beard poking out beneath the hood
still with the blade there turns back gives a
hand motion towards the ship
 Oh its about ten foot
 You can climb up on the cliff if you need
to
 No When you started this everyone was
going into the youre maybe three minutes
 The figure gets within  feet of where
youre standing and says Hey Piss off
 Closes his fist Three arrows get loosed
from the ship in your direction Thats a  to
hit Misses I believe Thats a  to hit
 And another 
 That is seven points of damage
 Go for it
 Its d plus your monk level isnt it
 Yeah you roll a d plus your monk level
 Six
 Ooh okay Roll a d plus
 Right the arrow is a d plus your dexterity
modifier
 I believe its let me check the rules real
fast
 Yeah its a d plus your dex
 Seven points of damage You send one back
you hear  but at a pretty decent
distance The other one that hit you thats eight
points of damage
 Thats a second ki point you spent
 Right but youve already used one reaction
so you have to spend another ki point to get an
additional reaction
 Eight points
 One point of piercing damage
 Okay go for it
 Yeah
 Is this to the guy that already took an
arrow or to another Because there were three of
them that fired at you
 The same guy gets hit by both arrows At
this point the guy who had given the order sees
you do this and his hand comes down gives a quick
shout over his shoulder Come on Take them out

additional You should probably pull up the

during the break

Yashas abilities Thats how it works out Yasha

right so top of the round Fjord in the middle
of this chaos now breaking the arrows being
flung you are in the water and ten feet below the
dock Whatre you going to do
 All right
 Yeah thats what it is No its Summers

 I love it What is the
 Well I was going to say the Misty Step is
it on a short rest or a long rest that it gets back
 Gotcha perfect
 All right make a persuasion check with
disadvantage
 Yeah Because you literally showed up
ruined this whole deal he was about to make
 Hes not willing
 The spell still happens he just doesnt
come with
 He tried
 How long is the
  feet Most likely yeah You have to
count it out Yeah easily you can make it
anywhere on that dock pretty much
 Well it doesnt kill Marius thats good
 All right so theres this blast this loud
thunderous sound which may have gotten the
attention of a nearby zolezzo or two
 Theres none in view currently so you dont
know it could be a while until one of them shows
up You get the sense that that was a loud noise
because its a Thunder Step That ends your turn
 Yeah That ends your turn That brings us
now to the bowmen The bowmen who
 No actually You showed up and made a
 but they dont know where you showed up
You just vanished out of sight
 Theyre all going to focus on On the one
they were already told to fire at so theyre all
going to aim at Beau Thats going to be
Actually they had a hard time with you and you
threw it back so only one of thems going to fire
on you The other two are going to fire at Caleb
Against Beau that is
  to hit
 At this point its midnight You guys went
there midafternoon so its been Yeah its
been past eight hours That is four points of
damage to you Beauregard
 All righty Then two attacks against you
Caleb
 Both are 
 They both splinter off of you no issue
 You are after Beau and Nott then other
characters go and then your turn
 Theyre going to go ahead and This guys
going to move up to the side here to get a better
view of you This guys going to shift off to the
side This guys going to move up to the top to
get a better view as well The one thats moving
by is going to be like Quick quick and hes
like shouting down into the door that leads deeper
into the ship underneath the ladder right there
That brings us to Beau and Notts turn
 This guy is Marius
 Beau its your turn What are you doing
 Right here All right so you rush up to
him
 Go for it Roll for an attack
  misses You punch short You swing and it
hits but it hits his heavy splint armor and hurts
your knuckles a bit and he takes it Now that
youre up in his face you can see hes a big
imposing halforc and currently looks to not feel
very threatened by you That was your first attack
  just hits
TRAVIS  just hits
 Six points of damage all right
 All right Thats a   plus two on a
constitution save So Stunning Strike no effect
unfortunately
 You still have your bonus action
 Okay You got it
 Nott
 As far as you know he doesnt see you
 Mmhmm
 That definitely hits Go ahead and roll
sneak attack damage
  points of damage You watch as he goes
from this arrogant watching you flounder in front
of him as he takes the blows and keeps grinning
suddenly double over as the bolt is now deeply
buried into his abdomen Yeah that was a pretty
tough hit Hes hurt
  Roll a stealth check
 Yeah you do
  Now you know All right that ends
your guys go It is now the Enforcers turn
 One Enforcer comes out of the center of the
ship and looks and sees this going The guy up top
goes Quick burn it all
 This guy is going to go ahead and jump back
down into the ship
 That Enforcers going to pull out a hand
crossbow and is going to go ahead and take a shot
at you since youre off in that way Has
disadvantage on the attack but youreright now
 Because youre out of his range Hes going
to go ahead and grab and pull Marius towards the
gang plank Hes going to go ahead and fire at
you
Thats  to hit
 Misses yeah You  with your shield
Ricochets off no issue Thats going to be the
end of the Enforcers turn Jester youre up
 You look like youre its close
 Okay  Yeah hes within  feet
 All right He the guy with Marius rolls
a natural  The guy next to Beau rolls a natural
three
  Paralyzed
 You are currently concentrating there The
big guy with the bolt in his stomach goes 
and his whole body locks up and you can see his
eyes go wild as he glances down at you unable to
move at all Does that finish your turn You can
keep moving the rest of your movement if you want to
 Around here you mean
 Okay    Thats as far as
you can get with your movement All right that
ends your go That brings us to Caleb
 Yep from lobbing this stack of fruits and
heavy wooden boxes into his head
 All right As the crates slam into him the
body rocks back for a minute but is still holding
itself in place Right now theres splinters of
wood sticking out of his armor his jaw is all
messed up The hood gets blown back and you can
see the grayish hair thats tangled and sea
airmatted that is now streaked with blood from
the impact Bits of his face are covered in gore
Hes looking pretty hurt
 Hes also taken a rough round This has not
gone well
 All right so Caleb that ends your turn
 Its now the captains turn who is
paralyzed His really really cool round that he
was going to do that was going to be really
awesome doesnt happen because hes fighting
against the spell Hes going to make his save
 Hes going to make a wisdom save to see if
he can resist the
 Thats a  He did not save Hes still
held
 All right That brings us to Caduceus
 Okay towards
 All right go ahead and make the ranged
attack roll Youre casting it at first level
 All right
 Guiding Bolt I think is  feet I think
its pretty far
 Yeah thatll hit
 Hes only wearing leather armor
 Nice
 The bolt hits him and and you see now this
vibrant glow as the impact the energy forms
around his chest creating this beacon The next
attack against that Enforcer right on the
gangplank has advantage Hes pretty visibly hurt
Hes not on his last legs or anything but hes
taken some wear and tear
 As a bonus action
 Go for it
 Full movement
 There Okay there you go You are not
visible at the moment That finishes Caduceus
turn Yashas up
 Understood
 Easy enough to do
 She does She gets two
 I mean you can Go for it She has
advantage on him because hes paralyzed
 No reckless any attacks against you
 Yeah Its been a while since youve been
reckless Its fine
 That hits and that is an autocrit because
hes paralyzed
  does not hit Unfortunately
 For her as a
 Yeah thats going to be bad for him This
is for the zealot There we go The first hit
equals d plus half your okay so its d plus
six damage
 The dice are doubled Plus an additional
d
 Thats doubled
  I think
 Thats  plus six for her barbarian level
Yeah she just eviscerates him
 Man As hes there frozen in place Yashas
rushed up and cleaves right through his chest and
you watch as he folds into two pieces both
tumbling off into the water Theres now two
halves of the orc floating in the water below
 All right Fjord youre up
 Yeah thatll get you cant get everybody
in the ship Youd be missing either the guy at
the front or the guy at the back Which one do you
want to
 Okay so the front then Thats a wisdom
saving throw
 That is a   plus two The guy at the
plus two He resists The guy next to Marius
fails and Marius fails You watch as both Marius
and the Enforcer standing on the gangplank their
faces immediately go dull as they stare up at
this what you see as nothing You have no visual
perspective on whats happening but suddenly they
both go slackjawed and stand staring up in the
air at this empty space
 Yeah kind of All right so thats your
action
 Anything with your movement
 All right You make your way to the edge of
the dock right there Perfect All right that
ends your turn Its now the bowmens turn Seeing
you now casting the spell making a ruckus on the
dock nearby all three of them turn to face you
This guys going to go ahead and shift over and
get a bit closer to the edge and all three of
them are going to fire at you Fjord
 Natural  on the first hit
 Of none of them
 Doublecheck that just in case The next hit
against you is  plus four
 Oh suffers You can remove that Okay and
thats a natural  plus four
 All three hit you The crit is not a crit
thanks to Caduceus
Thats going to be six points
of piercing damage seven points of piercing
damage and seven points of piercing damage
 Theyre going to go ahead and
then use their movement to back up a bit back into
the ship
This guys going to duck below over
here They all duck low and theyre all going to
attempt to hide
 Okay You watch as they all disappear into
the shadows of the ships deck Youre uncertain
where the bowmen are That brings us to Beau and
Nott
 Go for it
  to hit Yeah that hits
 Yeah its advantage to hit so you can roll
twice sorry
 There you go
 Because hes not aware that you were there
and you were hidden Yes
 Nice He immediately breaks out of the
stupor glances over and looks at you and hes
hurt pretty bad Hes glancing over in your
direction looking at the rest of everyone there
seeing how things are shifting Looking to his
ship he looks like hes planning something What
else are you going to do
 Go for it
  to hit That still hits
 

 He tumbles forward over and falls into the
water
 Marius no
 Marius is still just standing there in the
middle of the gangplank looking upward going
All right
 Beau
 They dont know that
 They dont know this ability
 All right 
  speed
 Oh I thought it was 
 Its a rough night out here in Nicodranas

 There we go
 There you go Youre up on the gangplank
with him now
 You can use your action to grapple if you
want to
 Okay Make an athletics check
 No it doesnt matter you have him I just
wanted to see you roll Hes not fighting at all
Hes literally just standing there going you
grab him
 Do you have a ki point
 You can You have to pull him back at half
speed but yeah
 Ill say that knocks him out of his stupor
 When youre choking him and forcing to pull
him backwards
 Yeah But grapple by putting your staff into
his throat and pulling him backwards
 Youve pulled Marius back
 All right that finishes Beaus turn That
finishes Notts turn now its the Enforcers
turn One Enforcer fell over keeled over dead
The other one is going to step back out from the
inside for a second Hes carrying a heavy
crossbow that he has winched back Pulls it up
and is going to spin and the first person he
sees coming out of there is probably going to be
you Beau because you are the one whos grabbing
him and pulling him off the gangplank as he steps
out and looks and sees you
 Id say you have half cover because of the
boxes that youve pulled up behind Unless you
want to use him as a human shield Thats up to
you
 He gets two shots Natural  and a 
which I dont think hits right
 Yep That is  points of piercing damage
 You have a reaction still right
 You take nine points 
 Is that how much it reduces it by total
 I know thats fine
 Okay reroll d plus your monk level plus
your dexterity
 No its monk level and dexterity youre
right You totally got it go for it
 All right you take seven points of piercing
damage That ends that That brings us to Caleb
No sorry Jester youre up first then Caleb
 On Beau
 All righty
 I know seriously
 Right now you can see one guy on the boat
 Whats the range on Sacred Flame
 He gets a what save Is it constitution or
is it wisdom
 Oh a dex That would be  thats a
failure
 Its all good It was a good move
 Thats as far as you go You used the rest
of your movement to get up to that point
 That ends your go Caleb youre up
 This is not a moral group by any stretch of
the imagination Theyre getting better than they
used to be but man
 Youre getting the boat in this too All
right Lets do it
 Okay Specify that next time but sure go
for it I know you would
 I know thats fine
 Youd have to spend an action to look for
it The name would be towards the back and its
facing away from you
 The Enforcer fails so he takes the full 
Success success and failure
 You move behind here Im going to roll a
saving throw for the ships sails Not bad The
sails do not catch fire Theyre charred a little
bit from underneath but the ship isnt now
suddenly a giant burning torchlight beacon in the
middle of the fucking harbor
 I know I respect that
 That ends Calebs go Captains dead
Caduceus youre up
 Yeah youre within range
 There you go eight points to Beau
 Wherere you going
 Okay Theres Caduceus Finishing your go
Yashas up
 Okay If she wants to she can attempt to
grapple and then pull him out of Beaus grip or
we can say she holds her action and then it gets
a little weird because its movement is what
you pull him out of the way
 Ill allow it
 Yes because he is resisting amongst her
grapple as well and its harder to do that
 Yeah All right now its Mariuss turn
Hes going to attempt to break free now that hes
full of mind and hes freaking out Whats he
whats going Make an acrobatics check against
your athletics Technically since youre both
grappling either you or Yasha can make the check
and its with advantage Ill say because youre
both holding
 Strength is plus three and it would be at
plus six probably
 All right go for it
 Oh he almost rolled really high
 He does still manage to break free Yay
 Hes going to run
 The ships not on fire but he has no reason
to trust any of you and was meeting with these
people If hes going to choose between the two
hes going to step into the ship there Hes like
 gets down low and is hiding But you
know right where he is That brings us to the top
of the round Fjord your turn
 At that guy You can look and see now
 he is
not the Enforcer that went below deck previously
Hes dressed similarly but now that you get a
better look at this view in the light hes
somebody else There is still one person down in
the ship
 That hits
 That hits Roll damage
 Yeah he has leather armor His AC is 
hes pretty easy to hit
 Ooh thatll do it Both blasts take him
down The attrition is not working well in his favor
 Caduceus you do hear a ways away not
here yet but you do hear some voices and
footfalls armored footfalls You get the sense
that zolezzo are on their way
 He will say on his turn when he gets there
 The bowmen now whove been hidden below the
deck and have endured the Fireball two of them
are going to from their positions stand up and
theyre going to take shots at you arrows
firing They have advantage on both because they
were hidden from you That is a  to hit
 Second one thats cocked Advantage That
is a  to hit
 They have sneak attack because they were
hidden from you  points of piercing damage
from those two hits
 The third goes and unfurls the sail and
pulls the rope and it begins to unroll A little
bit of wind is blowing It opens up a bit
 No it is fairly plain You get the sense
that theyre now looking for a way to get out of
here Ships arent the fastest when it comes to
exits but theyre trying That brings us to Beau
and Nott
 At the end of their turn these guys are
going to move back as well and attempt to hide again
 Theyre not very good at hiding though
 They rolled really bad All three of
them At once A one a three and a four
 Thats funny You see them duck down but
theyre all pulling out their arrow and nocking it
into the bow and you can see exactly where
theyre hidden Whats the plan Beau and Nott
 Make your choices guys
 No the Enforcers dead Fjord just blew him
up on the side Theres now only three bowmen on
the deck and theyre all hurt really badly from
the fireball explosion and they all think theyre
hidden but theyre not
 Move around the side All right Against
which one
 Go for it Roll for attack with advantage
because he does not see you
 Yeah that hits so go ahead and roll
damage With sneak attack
 The impact hits him and he falls back and
hits the edge of the ship and then tumbles over
and splooshes into the water behind You hear no
noise
 Okay
 You rush running across the gangplank As
soon as you come to the edge you look down and
theres one of the guys whos about to turn with
his bow and goes  and sees you
 Go for it roll for an attack
 Ten misses You go and kick and the water
on the slick deck makes you slip You catch
yourself and dont tumble off the side
 That hits You go for one roundhouse and
slip using the momentum you spin with a lower
circle kick like a sweep kick which is about
head level with him
 Eight points of damage Thatll do it The
bowmen dont have a lot of hit points
 He  and then falls unconscious onto
the deck of the ship
 You do have enough movement you have 
feet more so you leap down onto his crumpled
unconscious body and his other friend is going to
pull back to try and take a shot while hes
backing up towards the back portion of the ship
 Thatll hit Go ahead and roll damage
 And so he
You  and he falls unconscious
onto the ground
 Hes like  Make a
persuasion check
 Yeah
 You just killed or beat unconscious the guys
he was coming to meet
 Seven He right now is looking panicked and
the words arent coming through He thinks maybe
youre calling him a gentleman Hes like
 and hes backing away from you
 All right that ends Beau and Notts turn
 You do hear what sounds like some movement
The door is partially open to the cabin below and
there is light coming from the inside some sort
of lantern light You hear things being moved around
 You have five more feet to get to the door
and look beneath but you dont see anything yet
 Well the door is on the side so youd have
to put your weight against it yeah
 Youre up against the door That brings us
to Jester
 You can make an action to dash if you want
to get there and do nothing else
 Youre making your way across the gangplank
like oh god Youre just about to make it to
the ship and thats the end of your bonus dash
Caduceus youre up No sorry Caleb
 You can do that
 Vax is back baby
 Correct You can move  feet
 Its a bonus action to cast the spell Oh
and when you cast the spell and then as a bonus
action oh wow so its a dash action as the
spell when its cast as well so yeah Thats  feet
 You do actually Jester tumbles forward
into the boat from the sheer force of Caleb
 flashing into the space
 All right that finishes Calebs turn
 From around this corner
 begin to appear and now the zolezzo that
are coming around the corner are coming forward
with torches There are more a little further down
the way and theyre shouting out Whats going
on What is Looking around they can see you
Fjord they can see Yasha up on the side and they
can see people on the ship across the way
 But thats their turn Theyve acknowledged
you and theyre telling you to halt and theyre
asking for your attention Now its going to turn
to Caduceus turn They do not see you The sound
you heard you couldnt quite make out the
direction its coming from but you can now hear
it coming from around the edge of the street
 With
 Youre stretching the cantrip a bit
 Its a sound like a bird caw You cant
create the sound of a whole crowd screaming
  It does so
 All right go ahead and actually no this
would be on their end
 It does catch their attention and they look
over and the few that hadnt seen Fjord now look
over and see Fjord on the dock as well There you
go They are aware of those that are currently
visible on the deck of the ship and Fjord and
Yasha over there
 That ends it Yashas turn Whats Yasha
going to do
 She doesnt need to With her speed she gets
onto the ship there
 Okay That brings us to the top of the
round Fjord your go
 As you do that the guards are going Hey
Hey Halt and theyre drawing and loading
crossbows You are not stopping you are not
hailing you are not listening to anything theyre
saying They assume you are stealing a ship Which
you are
 The sails are unfurled
 Its still anchored
you notice as you get to the dock
 Yeah They were just starting to get the
process going of getting the ship done and there
is still somebody down inside rummaging through
the interior
 Yeah You as a sailor you get there and
asses the situation and youre like This is
going to take a little bit to get the boat out of
here
 I mean through natural means I dont know
what you have at your disposal but
 All right so youve taken your dodge
action All the bowmen are gone That brings us to
Beau and Nott
 Yeah youre tied onto the side and then
theres an anchor off the side
 You managed to pull it up Make a Strength
check to see if you can get it all the way up
 Oh sorry I misunderstood You go ahead
 Not both Its an action to untie and get it
off the dock
 Okay so you shove off a bit Theres still
a good distance The gangplank is there so its
not right up against the dock per se Theres not
much you can push off of but you do manage to get
it untied
 All right Nott
 This is great This is DD
motherfuckers
 Well there were a few times that Vox
Machina was in this territory
 She managed to untie it from the dock
itself
 No the gangplank is still resting
 Probably
 Okay
Ill make an image of that captain guy at the end 
of the dock or something trying to hail them down
Not saying anything Just doing this
 All right That ends your turn Nott Well
say it appears
 There you go Right there at the edge of the
dock
 All right That brings us to Jester
 You see the guards Theyre arming
crossbows Theyre running towards the dock One
of them has his hands up hailing Hey hey and
is trying to get your attention What are you doing
 Okay Where do you want it
 Okay
Very obviously run over and look like
shes running over here and hiding
 Okay
Im going to stay as hidden as I can 
on the boat crouched down so nobody can see me
 Good to know
 No thats the illusion
 All right
 Okay Go ahead and roll an attack for the AC
of wood which isnt terribly high
 It is It has an AC
 That hits
 Hits the water 
 Okay So two hit Go ahead and roll damage
  damage All right  The dock
splinters and bits of it char and burn and go
flying It  but its still standing It
wasnt enough to destroy the entire dock Its
damaged
 Okay  You vanish inside the
interior of the cabin pushing past Beau whos
been holding the door shut
 As soon as you come down inside theres a
lantern and theres one of the Enforcers who you
can see is burning papers

 He turns around and sees you
 You have a bonus action cantrip
 All right That finishes your turn That
comes to the guards The guards the one who was
putting his hands up and was shouting Hey to
hail you and was asking whats going on has no
choice but to assume that youre destroying the
dock and stealing a ship now Because you are
Hes going instead to pull out his heavy crossbow
and load it Theyre going to move up to the side here
 The weird butterfly effect of DD actions
 All right so the guards are going to go
ahead and theyre all going to fire
 Its going to be two against you Fjord two
against Yasha and one against Marius
 Against Fjord that is a  and a 
 All righty You take six points of piercing
damage
 Both against Jester terrible rolls That
is a  and ten They both just  past Oh
no those were against Yasha
 They could have seen you but Yasha was the
bigger threat but it still misses Yasha Last one
against Marius misses surprisingly with a
natural seven Hes just  and hes looking
at all this happening He looks freaked out
Thats going to end the guards turn Caduceus As
you are
  That gets you just
 Finds his own adventure

 No thats it
 There is Its a closed window but you
could try and break it
 Okay so youre over on that side Thats
the end of your turn
 Why not Just go all in Yasha
 All right so Yasha goes over to the side
pulls it up  Gets it on the inside
 Youre now currently not tethered to
 Okay Shes trying her best to protect
Marius
 I would say yeah The time you really miss
the Air Ashari All right Now its Mariuss
turn What Marius was going to do he cant do
now Well he might try
 No no Hold on Marius moves past Yasha
 He gets up to the top of the edge of the
ship And let me roll for him to see if
thats actually pretty good okay He glances
about the scenario takes in his chances and
whats happening and stands up and goes Hold
Hold please This is a big misunderstanding
Lets talk this out
 To the guards For the sake of this Im
going to have one of you guys roll for him Who
wants to roll his
 Persuasion check with disadvantage
 No
 Because it would make it more interesting
Okay yeah thats not having any effect on them
Theyre beyond convincing now it looks like
 Yeah he did But you know That finishes
the round Fjord youre up
 Sure
 Okay you make your way down and you join
up at the side of Caleb You can see now the
Enforcer thats there throwing the paper thats
currently burning onto the table and hes pulling
a weapon out and hes
 You said double dash It would have taken
that to get there so All right
 All right Now as he sees you and hes
pulling the blade you rush into the fray and
what heavy shadows still lie in the bottom here
with the little bit of lantern and fire light
thats lighting the space the shadows get darker
around him and you can see everyones breath is
visible suddenly in this under chamber as the
curse takes its hold on him That goes to Beau and Nott
 Beau has never been on a ship
 The one sailor is below deck right now
 Make an intelligence check
 Okay you look at it Youve been watching
boats come into harbor and youve read things
about it but mostly from your observational
skills which is one of your focuses and
strengths Beauregard youre like Okay I think
Ive seen people you know making ships go You
grab the ropes you pull and you yank past and
you watch as the sail picks up the wind and stiffens
 Its like Beau for those purposes up on
the top there holding the rope and youre like
Ah okay theres a sail
 Nott what are you doing
 As far as you know the gangplank is resting
on there You dont know if its connected at all
 Youre starting to drift a little bit The
wind has picked up a little bit
 Make an athletics check to grapple
 Straight  Yeah Like a wet paper bag he
goes over Ah  and they both slam onto
the deck below You have him grappled and youre
like holding him down Youre not you dont
weigh a lot but youre leveraging and pulling the
weight in a way where he cant his knees are
buckled and he cant actually get any ground to
hold himself up so You got him
 All right The Enforcer whos below who has
the curse is going to go ahead and swing forward
two attacks with his blade This is going to be
this is going to be against you Fjord because
youre the one that came in and cursed him
 Thats going to be a  to hit
  Shield off to one side Natural

 That is ten points of slashing damage
 You  You just manage to hold on by a
thread Your consciousness waning your eyes focus
angrily towards the target of your Hexblades
Curse
 All right That brings us to Jesters turn
 Okay Ones up front
 The one up here is the leader the one that
was guiding them on stuff
 He fails with a natural three Two natural
threes in a row Fucking lucky The third one on
the far end is a natural six Okay So You are
currently oh no its not concentration for
Charm Person Those three are charmed
 They are technically in combat with you
 Makes a wisdom saving throw and does so with
advantage if you or your companions are fighting it
 Yeah theres been enough aggressive action
theyre considered fighting Theyve all failed
their save Im going to do one more roll for all
of them The leader thats cocked Thats a
natural  plus two  Whats your DC
  Thats a natural ten and a natural 
They all fail again Yeah theyre all still
charmed Well done
 Thats kind of crazy actually All right
so well say the red here is Charm Person
 The three of them drop their weapons for a
second and are looking confused The ones
behind are still loading and getting ready
 Okay that ends your turn Jester Caleb
 Okay This is a natural seven thats a
failure After slashing into Fjord and turning
towards you and seeing that fall he throws his
weapon down and crawls under the table angrily
like Grr Im going to get you under this table
and then he gets there and looks very confused
 Lets see here Yeah well say thats what
his next action would be since technically its
out of turn
 Yeah Its happening simultaneously
 You look up and you see this scenario You
see the guards are still standing there at the
edge The ship is moving its slowly pulling
away
 That brings us to the guards turn The two
in the back are going to go ahead and fire Thats
going to be one at Beau and one at Yasha Against
Beau that is a  to hit
 Against Yasha that is a  to hit I
believe that does hit She doesnt have a huge
armor class if I recall She does take only five
points of piercing damage
 Well she hasnt attacked anything
 Did she take damage last turn Oh she was
attacked last turn so shes still raging
 But there were a few rounds there where she
didnt hit anything so the rage fell
 Oh thats true He fails so he goes to
fire and he has to choose another target
 Its okay Its a stlevel spell Instead
hes going to fire that at Yasha as well Okay
that is a failure That is a natural seven No
damage outside of the damage that she took there
At that point the leader goes Wait hold what
are you doing Stand back and the guys like
What are you talking about Hold on We have to
figure this out Something is strange about this
Hold up He starts shouting to hail in your
direction and the other guards are putting their
weapons away and are about to walk over The two
in the back are like What
 Yeah they are not sure whats happening
They are not perceptive enough to have seen that
its a spell effect that has changed them Theyre
confused by it Well see if they figure it out
soon With that these guys are going to begin to
walk and make their way toward the broken docks
 They see the illusory guy there and look
confused
 Theres the guy just waving to them Thats
all hes doing repeatedly Hes like one of those
mannequins holding the electrical signs on the
street Yeah hes a wacky waving
 A halforc
 These guards are going to chase up confused
and theyre going Sir Sir Sir and theyre
not entirely certain whats going on Theyre
really confused by the scenario Thats going to
go to Caduceus
  
 Oh this way
  
 Its a tenfoot drop
 Yep
 Sure make an athletics check
 Nine You slip and fall a little bit You
get down about five feet and you make a splash sound
 Yeah they dont notice
 Five ten   Yeah youre slowly
wading through the water
 Okay that ends youre go Yashas turn
 Yasha as far as you know does not know
boats Shes never mentioned anything about it
and Yasha looks like she doesnt know what shes
doing Shes not giving orders or rushing to take
a post
 Yasha will go ahead and push on the
gangplank Make a strength check for Yasha shoving off
 She shoves and the whole boat shifts
suddenly The gangplank plunges down into the
water and its floating there on the top The ship
gets shoved off about ten feet in that direction
 All right all right and he stays quiet
there and doesnt do anything Fjord
  feet of movement to get up there
 You have  more feet of movement and you
have an action
 You get up and man it
 It starts arcing and making its way in that
direction turning slowly
 Okay Fjord in a fit of frustration and
anger once the rudder is locked in place and the
ship begins to turn in position bashes his head
in very much a This is so stupid movement
It doesnt knock you unconscious but you are
dizzy as fuck You have you hit your head real
hard on there to do a point of damage Do you want
to do that
 Frustration youll hurt yourself but to
take a point of damage
 Youre like Ugh Theres a little bit of
blood trickling out from where the head got mashed
a little bit The partially splintered wood from
the explosion of the Fireball earlier
 That ends Fjords turn Now the ship is
moving on initiative  The ship moves out and is
over there now and is turning this way That
brings us to Beau and Nott
 Youre just using your action to hold onto
the sail and keep it open
 Youre the only one really
 Listening to the thing you eventually get
her to figure it out You get the sail situated
and that will be your action for the turn Okay
Nott
 There is a couple of coils of rope left
there in the far corner of the youll have to
release him to go get it
 Still holding him because hes keeping
quiet the rope hovers over and plops next to you
 Okay Go ahead and make a sleight of hand
check for me Well just a general dexterity
check actually Youre not proficient in this
necessarily so just add your dexterity modifier
 Okay youve begun the process Its not an
immediate
 Youre not a master of rope tying
necessarily This round the ropes are slipping
and while Marius is fighting against it a little
bit youre not getting too much of a hold on it
All right that ends your go The Enforcer below
who has completed the now is when hes ducked
behind because he lost his action to do that He
now gets under the table throws his weapon down
and goes What the fuck Goes to pick up the
weapon thats his turn Jester you go Its so ridiculous
 No but he performed the action
 Yeah spell ends
 The leader goes No who considers you a
friend at the moment and is seemingly really
distraught to watch this happen
 I take it youre not concentrating on your
Silent Image anymore
 Okay That vanishes right as she kills
herself and falls into the water Very confused
 Okay You move up to the door and holding
it there
 Youre keeping low yeah Its half
movement you still get there and youre prone
All right Caleb
 No How it works is you give them a task
He went and hid under the table for safety which
he did
 But it wasnt specific enough It wasnt a
very specific suggestion
 No you locked him down there Youre in
here with me All right you put out the fire
You can see now it looks like what was a map that
is mostly burned entirely
 On the map Yeah you see part of the Coast
and you see some notes and you see something on
there Clearly looking at it there is information
on it but youre putting it out 
 Thats going to be your turn That brings us
to the guards turn The guards in the back are
shaking the other guard What are you doing
Theyre getting away Hes like Look This is a
very confusing scenario and were trying to
ascertain whats happening They seem safe for
now but why did this dock explode
 She just killed herself go check on her
make sure shes okay The guards like Natural
 Theyre like This is foul magic He starts
slapping him in the face and hes like Get
away and hes like Call a mage we have to get
this taken care of
 They start shouting for help Frumpkins
still hanging out over here I figured you
wouldve blinked Frumpkin
 You still have an octopus Frumpkin with you
The guards are now
 Yeah Theyre momentarily distracted by all
the things that have happened the ship getting
away and their leaders essentially acting really
dumb and now ascertaining that its magical they
dont know what to do so theyre starting to
shout out and one of thems starting to leave and
go to get help They start darting this way
shouting These guys all begin to inspect and try
to see if they can find the poor woman This guy
dives into the water to try and see if he can save her

 Hes now swimming in the water going Where
are you No You have so much to live for

 Thats their action Caduceus
  Thats as much as you can get Its half
movement in the water

 Yeah theres a single torch over here that
is loosely lighting the vicinity
 For Caduceus you do have a high passive
perception There are shapes in the water below
 No They werent immediately at night no
Youre getting out under the dock and you and a
little bit of light thats coming through from the
moonlight you look and you can see something in
the water
 That ends your turn Yashas go
 Sure Youre just holding the ship Not much
else to do
 All right so at this point Marius is
theres not much else he can do Fjord your turn
 All right make a perception check please
  You do
 You do see

  Im so happy
 This went so far from any of my
expectations I love Dungeons  Dragons
 All right so keeping up with that that
ends Fjords turn The boat now moves on
initiative count  to there
 All right Beau and Nott well say for the
purposes of expediency on this
 You felt the door go  Thats all you
know
 You dont see Caleb on the ship Wheres
Caleb
 Okay Calebs standing there
 All right Caleb you doing anything
 Yeah hes making his way up the stairs
after you
 Go ahead roll for attack
 Oh thats right Ah its cocked Natural
six
 Well yeah scurvy you know
  points of damage  Right in the
back of the skull Hes like Ahh and you can
see him holding back hes holding the sword Hes
hurt But hes still coming at you
  All right With an immediate burst
of speed in a rush very akin to The Flash making
his way through the city Caleb just 
appears there on top with Fjord and Beau
 The guy whos now looking at you Jester
you see the guy had his sword out and Ah
looks confused and sees you and goes  and
is going to come up with the sword He doesnt
realize how fucked he is He doesnt know that the
ship has been taken Hes feeling pretty competent
 Probably All right so on that hes going
to go ahead and make his way towards you Jester
He comes up and is going to make two swings at
you
 Well first you have to see if it hits That
is going to be a  to hit I believe that misses
 Thats a  to hit
 All right go for it That is ten points of
slashing damage to you
 A twohanded  swings past you
 He has to make a save right
 That is a natural  but has no bonus to
his dex so its a 
 Right because its a racial ability
 He takes half damage What is it
 All right Ice shards pierce out of the
blast area and his body is  Hes looking
really hurt now and hes frustrated and his eyes
are starting to go a little wild realizing that
this is turning on him pretty heavily All right
Caduceus  Youre just like breathing
hard As you glance over
 All right Yasha goes up and brings Caduceus
back onto the ship
 You have a bonus action
 All right You got it Fjord
 Seven points to you Fjord anything Just
keeping the ship going
 On this way The boat continues on for
another  or  feet actually  feet Its
starting to get a little speed and its picking up
the wind as its making its way curving out
towards the harbor The guards continue running
off These guys are all searching for the body of
the woman
 The Enforcer actually technically would have
his attack on this round I missed that The
Enforcer does his attacks on you Jester
 Yeah you can Its your turn now
 You get one attack
 Make an intimidation check
  He doesnt buy it
 Hes like back in The deck isnt very
high He cant really look and see the ship before
you entirely Hes just seeing you right there in
the way Hes just hacking at you with his sword
 So the words dont come through He thinks
its a bluff
 Caleb
 You are down next to her
 Persuasion
 Disadvantage
 Yeah what did you roll
 No you guys are all standing on the door
and going like Come on bud Come on Hes
going No No Youre lying
 Yeah the guards arent an issue anymore at
the moment Caduceus anything you need to do Or
you just holding on the ship
 Got you All right Bringing it back Fjord
anything Holding the ship Ship continues off
You guys are picking up speed now as the wind has
come in and the ship is now making its way
 You turned it around a little bit
 That was going bad
 Oh yeah Thats why I love when shit goes
wrong like this These are my favorite moments in
DD The Enforcer is going to go ahead and take
two more attacks on you
 You know what no He does see Caleb Now
actively takes a look behind and then turns
around and runs down below deck
 Hes running down below deck You do get an
attack of opportunity if you want to take it
Jester
 Yeah thatll hit Go ahead and roll
damage
 As he turns around youre like No wait
 Into the back of his skull He falls and
 slides down the stairs limply
 I mean you put an axe to the back of his
head
 You didnt say that out loud
 Its not your turn You dont have a bonus
action because its a reaction You wouldnt be
able to use it until next round
 The AC of Wood is a good Alpha title
 As you pull away out into the main harbor
Fjord for the first time in a long time you
feel as the stress of the sequence passes over
you the sensation of being at the helm of a ship
bypasses the momentary frustration It feels good
to feel that wind in your hair again and to be
guiding it through the waters and seeing the dark
horizon in the distance You feel that bald rage
subside Looking past you can see the guards are
still running up the streets with their torches
Therell probably be a search party
back
 The good news is you dont think they were
paying attention to the back of he ship thanks to
the distraction that you set so they dont know
the name of the ship That might help to your advantage
 It is called
 No it is not It is called The Mist
 With a I
 Now pushing past midnight to the very early
morning hours you make your way out and as far
away from the edge You can see the lights of
Nicodranas begin to fade a bit just enough where
you can feel comfortable Marius is there bound by
ropes There still wild eyed and looking at all
this All right then Who the fuck are you
 My name is Marius LePual
 What did I do
 Im very confused
 He looks around hes like I was coming to
tell some business contacts of mine that something
they hired me for didnt pan out
 I dont know theyre very mysterious
 Okay He goes Why didnt you say that in
the beginning
 I dont know a Gentleman I just know that
I was supposed to look for that delivery
 Whoever was going to bring it I didnt
expect for you to come in here and slaughter my contacts
 Nothing I was going to make some coin
pass it over That was it
 I dont know Mysterious folk
 It was supposed to come find me in the
cove never showed up and they had been waiting
in town for a few days and they were coming back
and I this was the night where I was supposed to
tell them either bring it to them or the deal
was off and I was supposed to give back the money
that I owed them So 
 I know that I am very well aware of that
right now Im a little freaked out not going to lie
 Make an intimidation check
 He goes Right Im being truthful I
know it was supposed to be for a captain Captain
Avantika Shes a right intense person Ive only
seen her once She doesnt really leave her ship
in port when shes in which is rare Her
reputation keeps her not from coming in directly
 Well her ship is the Squall Eater
 Shes a bit of a forceful taker of things
she wants
 Thats one word to say it If you want to
find her your best bet is probably somewhere in
the Swavain Islands Dont know where directly
Im just hired as the errand boy
 Swavain SWAVAIN I was just supposed
to come back here Supposed to meet up with the
folks of the Mist the ship that youve now
commandeered Youve killed them all What are you
going to do with me
 Im useful Im helpful I can swab the
deck I can cook
 What you got
 Yeah yeah you did
 Make an investigation check
 Okay you find a pouch of  platinum
pieces
 You find another pouch thats hidden within
his belt pouch that contains  gold pieces three
silver  copper and what looks to be a pouch of
chewing tobacco
 Well so youre not going to kill me
right
 Thats fine Thats good odds Ill take
those odds Can you at least loosen these a bit
 As Yasha picks him up and ties him to the
mast hes like Oh
 Okay well where are we going then
 No I dont know an Ionos
 As you guys all head down below deck to take
in what exactly you have at your disposal as you
are now the current owners of the Mist
 Professor Thaddeus is somewhere at the
city
 Make an animal handling check
 Not while fighting
 Total of what
  Youre shouting out to the sky Time
passes No Professor Thaddeus
 As you head down below deck to take stock of
what you have were going to end there Well
pick up next week
 Thank you That was fun
 Who knows He got splattered
 No he didnt He was going to be the nasty
one
 Anyways well done guys You have a boat
and a handful of people in the city that saw your
faces Most of your faces
 You have a weasel and your mom has a puppy
And theres an owl somewhere
 Thats up to you guys to figure out next
time we come around
 Well done Well pick this up next week and
see where the Mighty Nein are going what theyre
planning to do and what the next leg of their
adventure is Until then have a wonderful night
have a wonderful week we love you and is it
Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back Last we left off The Mighty
Nein had been following a story thread They had
encountered some pieces of paper that alluded to a
mystical orb that they had previously encountered
that seemed to be related to something about your
patron Fjord After unknowingly having a vision
and absorbing this orb within yourself you
completed your business up in the Empire and
following information in this note you made your
way south outside of the Dwendalian Empire to the
Menagerie Coast to the city of Nicodranas which
was home and is home to Jester
 Yeah Bought some pets along the way lost
some pets along the way but you met the Ruby of
the Sea You aided her in absolving herself of the
stress of having a really unfortunately
aggressive admirer who was becoming a serious
problem so you told him to stop by cutting off
his hand and sending him away forever
 Then you went to inquire the docks at night
looking for an individual named Marius LePual
 You stealthed you way there began to
formulate a plan to listen in Unfortunately due
to a not quite as quiet attempt at entering the
water garnished their attention A not quite
effective attempt at deceiving them triggered them
to realize that they were being followed and
proceeded to try and cover their tracks and take
out those who would be following them That led to
a scuffle in the battlefield of the docks here in
the wharf where you alerted the guards managed to
take down these shadowy figures captured Marius
LePual and hijacked their ship called The Mist
where you managed to leave the docks out into the
night air the moonlit open night You had just
managed to take down a few figures that remained
on the ship a few things were burned in the
process The chaos was palpable Caduceus managed
to swim out to you guys in time to make it onto
the ship and where we left off you all had taken
a moment and some of you began to head back into
the ship to see what lied within Mighty Nein
what would you like to do
 Jester I think was rushing down
 Whos heading down
 Jester and Nott Who else
 Okay and Caleb Caduceus youre staying
up Yashas
 Yasha steps over to you Caduceus and
she puts a hand to your shoulder and she goes
Glad youre okay
 You keep finding me Or they do
 Yasha stands up looks back towards you
guys goes over and takes a rope and begins
helping you guys hold onto the sails watching you
and figuring out what to do None of you have ever
really run a boat before
 Well shes just helping you out with
whatever you need on the ship
 Okay make an investigation check
 Okay glancing over the side where the
Fireball had impacted a lot of the wood is
charred black There is visible sign of burning
Nothing is on fire but there was a flashburn
Some of the wood right around the edge of the
deck is broken and splintered in a bit and part of
the sail underneath was burned and singed Not
enough to the point where it tore it away from the
mast But there is visible damage but nothing that
impedes your movement Just more aesthetic damage
 You guys head down Jester as youre the
first person down the first thing you notice is
at the bottom of the steps you see the fellow
with the axe stuck in him and hes on his stomach
and slowly crawling forward
 He looks over his shoulder You see the
blood streaks down the side of his face and
 begins to crawl quicker away from you
  His fingernails are scraping
against the wood floor
 Thats when he passes out
 Okay Hes just like Ugh
 Nott as you rush up to the shadowed deck of
The Mist the moonlight still coming down you can
see the outer shape of the stilldamp Caduceus
legs tucked into his shoulder leaning back
against the inside of the left hand of the deck
or what would be considered the port side
 The quarters of this ship its designed to
be not a comfortable ship but a fast ship The
crews quarters and the deck below was called
for bigger ships itd be the gun deck but its
where the cabin is Its pretty tight for a human
Caduceus youre have to really bend and stoop
down to make your way through But as you come
down you find both Jester and Caleb currently
sitting around an unconscious enforcer one of the
cloaked figures that was involved with the crew
that previously had this ship
 Okay
 Okay
 Okay you yank it out and theres a streak
of blood and you watch as what would be the open
axe wound begins to slowly seal itself up to the
point where its still going to be healing for a
while but it scabbed over instantaneously
 Okay
 Caduceus heads back upstairs
 The person comes to consciousness
immediately as the axe is pulled  You
get a better look at him now You can see
scruffed probably unshaven for the past two
weeks coming out in tufts It looks like there
are parts where the hair isnt growing in because
theres scarring or some sort of heavy acne at a
younger age prevented those follicles from
developing Pockmarked face weathered from sun
and perpetual sunburns You can see the actual
hair itself is a matted greasy mess of a light
brown color Looks like the kind of person youd
imagine lives at sea and not in a very monetarily
comfortable income
 Whats that Who the fuck are you
 Just following orders sorry
 I dont know anything about that
 We were delivering a message picking up a
message
 Well In his position right now hes
being trepidatious in giving you information The
more youre prying the more hes closing off and
his words are trailing off I dont
 Make an intimidation check
  His whole body tenses his eyes dart
around the three of you and then slackens and he
exhales in a sense of resignation You know what
Fuck Ill tell you what you want Anything you
need to know Just can you let me go Drop me
back off in town or something
 Yeah well its not worth it He sits up
and you see that hes bruised and even though hes
been healed hes not used to the aftermath of
physical confrontation the way you guys are Hes
like  leans up against the table a bit
and puts his back against it so hes leaning
against the leg and top of it 
 This is The Mist Were a sister ship to
Captain Avantikas Our captain was Captain
Jawgrasp but I take it you probably killed him
too
 Well it makes sense Were not supposed to
leave any survivors whove seen what they
shouldnt have seen General business
 Just dont want to be followed Its part
of our directive
 More or less Well just say were not keen
on the taxation and enforcement of the Concord on
these seas So we do what we feel is necessary
 Yeah
 The Squalleater thats her ship
 Primarily it was maps to locations of
things that were important For our travels
 Like things that I wasnt the navigator
I didnt know specifically but I was told to
burn everything
 You rummaged through and found a few things
Most of its scrap and ash or blank sheets that
look like they were scribbled notes in a code that
you dont really understand This is the only
visible thing
 We were sent by Avantika to head back to
Nicodranas and were supposed to wait for about a
week or two Interface with that guy Marius
Either he was going to pay us back for the money
if he didnt get what he was supposed to find and
if he did have what he was supposed to deliver
one of the things I burned was a drawing of it it
was an orb thing We were supposed to take that
back to Avantika
 Avantikas on whats the island called I
dont remember Dont fucking remember what it
was called It was on there Thats it right there
 Its not a secret its just mostly
avoided Its near one of the reef clusters of the
Lucidian Ocean this side of the coast
 All right you do the Mending cantrip and
because I do not have a completed map for you
well use our imagination
 It completes a much larger piece of paper
that you think would have a bunch of other either
islands or the things around it It looks like it
may have been a much larger size Unfortunately
the ink does not come through on it
 You still have the ink of that yeah Its
a large piece of paper that is mostly blank and
then theres that one section that is stained with
the burned edges and has the actual drawing
 There was some things with bits of coded
language on it it looked like But those have
also been burned and theyre in chunks You do
your
 Is it ten minute casting time
 As a ritual its whatever the duration
is
 One action plus ten minutes okay There you
go Then it would be a total of  minutes All
righty While youre working on that you guys can
continue to pry if you want
 I mean probably lay low for a while
Theres other jobs out there Find my way back to
Darktow eventually
 Shes a weird one Her whole crew theyve
got some weird mystical thing theyre obsessed with
 Thats one of the things were supposed to
be picking up yeah Theyve got some creepy
religious thing We work for her She hired us as
the sister ship out of Darktow and weve been
doing errands for her
 Darktow yeah
 Its generally the hub of most unlawful
activity out here Used to belong to the Concord
but about  years back it was taken by people of
my professional interests and they havent been
able to take it back since
 Yeah its an island
 Swavain Islands is the whole series of
islands
 Darktow is one of the islands far far west
of here though
 Im not the navigator but I remember going
in and out There were little markers set on areas
where we were supposed to like visual guides if
we were on the right paths and to help us get
through the reef
 And to go around is another hundred miles
to your trip
 Yes Well weve made to and out once We
were going to go back after this
 Are you still working on your spell
 Oh god no No ones going to fucking
settle on that thing Its fucking cursed
 Yeah
 Its supposed to be something there that
she wants Well shes waiting on us to get back
with whatever were supposed to pick up and if
they didnt have it there then we were supposed
to try and find out where the next one might
possibly be
 I think thats the island yeah its
mostly junglecovered
 I dont know You get the sense the more
he looks at it one hes definitely not the
navigator of the ships crew and probably cant
read
 Gallan
 Gallan Wesmen
 Thank you
 Ive met many travelers
 His eyes go a little narrow Hes like Oh
no not another one
 Im okay
 Ill think on it
 Ive seen her Ive not actually spoken to
her that was mainly
 No She mainly stays on the ship
 He scratches his head Shes elf I think
Shes got them elven features the pointy ears
the whole brownred skin Big hair that comes in
strings Sleeveless coat high collar big scarf thing
 I didnt get all the details I wasnt one
of the important ones
 Hes sitting there going Yeah Yeah youre
right
 Fuck them Fuck them Im a survivor
 I had a what He reaches back and is
like Theres like still blood back there of
course and hes like Im okay Is it bad
 Well wed just stocked up so weve got
probably about two weeks of tack and water
and some ale below
 I know how to repair I was more of the
ship carpenter
 Thats really on brand
 Ill say sure Technically ten minutes is a
while but well say between the small talk
youve completed your spell
 Sure With the slips that you have you read
through it and it seems to be a list of supplies
that were supposed to be purchased A lot of them
seem to be heavy bits of rope chains climbing
pitons You see ball bearings torches Youre not
quite sure why this was encoded per se and
only for the slips that you have that are visible
but its mainly just a list of materials
 Unfortunately no You look around you and
there is ash everywhere Even the air has bits of
ash that are still floating in the space They
burned through the purpose of that battle while
you guys were dealing with all of that this guy
was in here torching everything Youre lucky
to have gotten that bit
 Thanks I take pride in my work Hes
still touching the wound in the back of his
head unsettled
 No I can come on
 You look over and he had a sword The
thing he was swinging and attacking you guys with
in the doorway earlier
 No it tumbled down the stairs when to took
an axe to the head
 As youre taking it hes like Sorry about
that
 Profession
 Yeah
 Okay
 Okay
 Thank you Should I go get my stuff
then
 Ah He points towards you and Um Hes
not a very intelligent fellow Go fetch me
some dried meat
 Im going to go lay down for a minute
 Okay
 You head down to the cabin quarters to one
of the small cots that are there essentially and
tie him down Hes like Mmm He passes out
hes exhausted
 GALLAN
 All right While thats happening the rest
of you on the surface where are you taking it
 Time of nightish
 Yeah its maybe 
 
 in the morning
at this point
 Got you Okay
 Yeah But you just take some distance in
case of pursuit Got you Its a pretty quick
ship You can see why it was used as a messenger
ship Youre used to cargo ships and things that
are used for shipping so its nice to have one
thats designed just for speed
 Hes tied to the mast right now
 Hes fallen asleep as well because hes just
been there while you guys were doing your thing
No one is paying attention to him and hes had a
long day Hes like 
 Ugh
 What was that all about
 Its still dark
 Okay Was that necessary
 I wasnt headed anywhere I was going
to give back their money and send them off on
their way and you attacked and they werent
going to let me stay behind I guess
 Apparently
 Well I dont have it
 Right I dont really I was just hired to
pass on a letter and wait for some sort of an
arrival of that and then it never came and then
I asked for an extension in case it was just
taking its time to get there And then never
showed up So I had to return the money
unfortunately But you know I like keeping a
reputation as a reliable messenger
 I was going to give it to whats his
name Captain Jawgrasp Big fella you cut
the fuck out of and kicked him off the side of the
docks
 This is the second time
 Well before they found me on the side of
the docks here at the wharf and they asked me if I
knew the quickest way to get this letter up north
to Shadycreek Run
 Not a fucking clue none of my business I
dont ask questions of those who are you know a
full foot and a half taller than me and can
probably wipe the floor with me I just nod
take my money and do the job Once again I
have a reputation 
 I feel comfortable all right you know
when I can fucking move Sorry sorry Im just
a bit grouchy
 I paid good money for this shirt Please
dont do anything
 You rip them underneath the ropes as he is
tied to the mast
 You start tearing them off in chunks Hes
like No No
 Ah He starts pulling up the scrap of his
sleeves Do you have any idea how much I paid for this
 Im going to remember this
 He combs his hair over
 He pulls a tooth out
 Roll a d see how many no
 Not criminal Im not a criminal I do
business with whoever pays well I dont ask
questions so I dont know if Ive done any
crimes
 Exactly So if I dont know technically who
Im involved with and what the larger scale of my
work is if anybody starts asking questions Im
as dumb as the rest of them Its got me this far
 Thats for the people to decide
 He goes over and looks Cant see it
 It has been the truth Why am I lying to
you right now youve destroyed my shirt youve
made me lose a tooth
 Look Im a very anxious fellow And when
things go ass up Im having a breakdown right now
 Okay sure fine Ill do that for you
Whatever you want
 Makes his way below deck and passes by these
guys
 Hi
 Yeah they all come out and join you on the
deck
 Make a this would be a survival check
since this is no For you make that a history
check with advantage Since it does fall into your
sailor background
 It could be one of three reefs
 Yeah Its a toss up youre not entirely
sure which one it is Give me a second I can
probably narrow it down for you Give me a second
 It could be either Inkclaw or it could be
Deep Row Those are the two that come to mind
 The Deep Row is a little bit further away
that ones more to the west of where you guys are
There are a number of small islands all throughout
the various reefs that arent on the larger maps
And you havent been all over the coast these are
all just from the trade routes youve done and
the things that arent directly near or youll pass on
the trade routes some things arent even charted
 Well travelwise this would be say we put
this at the speed of a longship so per day you
could probably do about  miles in a longship It
looks like travel to to which reef To Inkclaw
Its about  or so  miles from Nicodranas
 Thats the thing As you consider and you
know it takes a number of people to maintain a
ship To go at the speed you would need to youd
need to have somebody whos manning the sails
somebody whos navigating the ship somebody whos
actually necessary for maintaining the course
 As you guys are having this moment of
conversation you cant help but notice in the
middle of this talk quiet off to the side
Yashas just on the outskirts of you holding onto
the rope of the sail She hasnt tied it down yet
shes just using herself to hold and maneuver the
sail because thats all she knows But there is
on the far end on the port bow of the ship is
still Caduceus legs curled up to the chest
looking out over the ocean
 No that was in the Wharf
 Yeah The Restless Wharf
 Which as a note you would know there are a
few different positions that probably need to be
filled There definitely needs to be a captain
there needs to be a navigator there needs to be a
quartermaster who is essentially the first mate
that is the second in command under the captain
and handles all of the elements there Youre
going to need some form of a cook someone that
handles and prepares food Youre probably going
to need a bosun
 Bosun handles the upkeep on the ropes and
the sails and general deck upkeep
 There is the carpenter below Carpenter does
ship repairs and upkeep as well Barrelkeepers
are those that maintain the barrels of supplies
Theres a bunch of different you dont need all
of these necessarily
 No this is made for speed Not that youve
noticed at least
 You do see Yasha whos still holding the
rope but staring off to the south
 Thats fine I guess
 She looks back at you and back at the south
and says Just looking for a storm
 You guys at this point have gone down and
youve been introduced to the wonders of hardtack
Which is a lot of essentially hefty crackers
Shitty shitty crackers
 You do find a couple of barrels of fresh
tropical fruit which is new for you Caduceus
especially Shortterm travel elements there
 Its stocked at the necessary level for a
twoweek journey
 Oh yeah you have everything on you to
create and evoke all sorts of unique flavors
 Are you calling everybody from the crew
together You are in the process of planning it
out and youre taking stock of everything you have
at your disposal and you hear Fjord up top calling
you guys
 Yasha is listening out of the corner of her
ear and raises her hand and looks back
 Next city up would be Port Zoon
 Thats about a threeday travel to get
there
 I think it was Ignus
 Theres not a lifeboat per se There is a
small row skiff
 Youve not hired a crew before You just
know what youve worked for which is not a lot
 Its maybe depending on the job two three
gold a day
 Ignus was in the Restless Wharf
 Yeah Ill say you can slowly over time
focus Itll take you about a good hour or so
but you could eventually get the sail to be
unsinged
 Its about this point you look over in the
horizon and you can see the faint hint of dark
blue turning to lighter blue
 You can very faintly see towards the horizon
where Nicodranas is the occasional little soft
light of the lighthouse Youre not completely out
of sight of it and when its this dark and you pay
attention you can just barely see that little
blip of light
 Yeah theres no light on the ship
 Zhelezo
 All right You guys take shifts throughout
the evening To the early elements of the morning
 Sure
 Nott is a One Earther All right you guys
keeping first watch make a perception check
Whoevers maintaining that either advantage or
you both roll independently
 Keeping an eye out you begin to watch as
multiple ships begin to cruise out from
Nicodranas At first you begin to get nervous but
watching them you can see its the early morning
Right as dawn hits a lot of these fisherman ships
start going out and finding sections where lots of
schools tend to come to feed Beyond that you
dont see any encroaching danger
 You have sails There is a flag that sits at the
top of the main mast but it is currently tied up
 Its big so youd have to unfurl to see
it
 Yeah you can bring it down You bring the
flag down and open it up and its a light gray
flag that looks almost like a curled wave It
looks like a wave of water that curls away Thats
the best you can ascertain as to what the design
means
 You guys finish your shift Whos taking
next shift
 Okay
 It does not
 Whos taking next shift Its Fjord and
just Fjord Fjord and Caduceus out there for
second shift
 Yeah perception check from each of you
 Keeping an eye out on this as well you
towards the end of your shift notice one ship
that isnt one of the fishermen ships or one of
the traders ships that youve seen in the docks
and pointed out to you It is one of the Zhelezo
search ships Its not leaving too far from the
docks but its at least patrolling around the
outskirts
 The ship does have a wide berth Its only
one ship thats going across the entire coast
there but thats one thing youve noticed Its a
danger
 Okay You guys finish your time at watch
The rest of you come to consciousness Its now
late morning going to be approaching the
afternoon fairly soon but youve woken up some
food has been devoured your cabin mate Gallan
has come to consciousness and has instinctually
gone to start looking at the side of the boat and
starting to repair bits of the Fireball damage you
had left Pulls out his tools starts going to
work on that
 Marius is choking through some hardtack
What do you guys want to do
 Same city The Restless Wharf and the Open
Quay are two large sections of docks on the north end
 You do know that when ships check into
port you have not been in charge of it but
youve seen it usually there is a ledger of
ownership or deed of ownership to the ship that
the captain presents to the wharfmaster so that
they can keep tabs on who comes in and comes out
 It got burned
 You can probably get the gist of it Lets
give it a shot You can certainly try
 Yeah
 Okay To what
 Great
 I would love to help you little goblin
girl However I cant really write or read
 Its painted on
 Right He goes back to repairs
 As far as you know they dont check the
sails The sails are designed to show allegiance
to certain areas If for whatever reason the
ship was searched and a sail was found that
perhaps was known to be not kosher with the laws
of the coast then that would be a problem But
thats only if the sail itself is
 Its possible You probably wouldnt want to
go into port with the flag unfurled
 Okay In order to do so youll have to
dangle from the actual stern of the ship
 Yasha looks confused Okay I guess and
turns you over and holds you off the side 
Yashas even having to wedge against the side because
to get you further enough down its about ten feet
from the stern so Yashas having to get her foot
caught up underneath the railing
 Jeez
 GIF of the week right there You manage to
write in a really extravagant well practiced
Jester way The Mistake on the back of the ship
Yasha lifts you back on board Any other
preparations you guys want to do
 Yasha goes Ill stay
 No
 Youd have to get fairly close to even drop
anchor and you dont want to have to row
 The strangest of Wildemount backgrounds You
have to get pretty close unless you want somebody
to be rowing that boat for a long time
 Honesty I appreciate that
 Okay Thisll be interesting Youre helming
the ship
 Okay as youre making your way towards
Nicodranas having this conversation the Zhelezo
ship is doing its patrol across You have to time
the best way to come through without gaining its
attention Who wants to be in charge of trying to
navigate the ship
 That would be you I think Fjord Make an
intelligence check and Ill give you advantage
because you have a sailor background and you
understand some of the pathways especially since
watching and noticing this earlier with Caduceus
youve seen it move back and forth
 The Zhelezo ship passes by and it begins to
inspect another ship that is coming in from the
western trade route
 Okay you want to make a forgery of it
 As youre watching this youre also helping
tell Jester what you think might be included in
the paper that youve not really seen Make
 Youve seen the papers but you havent
studied very heavily what is contained on these
 Shes a tiefling If youd like to make a
forgery check
 Roll a d and add your intelligence
modifier and your proficiency because you are
proficient with forgery
 Holy shit Okay you craft what is probably
the most evenlyconstructed and in some ways
beautiful deeds to a ship It has borders on it
the signature thats on there looks very formal
and probably from some naval captain
 Yeah its subtle
 Youre not sure what the content would
require but youve seen a few formal documents in
passing and you make it up as you go and you hope
its enough Youre proud of it but you hope its enough
 Okay Are you taking it in to dock or are
you waiting outside and taking the skiff in
 Its up to you
 The sails been fixed
 The wood is being repaired but its a few
days of repair to get all that taken care of
 Thats DD man Thats how it works
 Okay Restless Wharf or the Open Quay
 Open Quay okay You make your way towards
the Open Quay Thankfully you timed it so that
the one patrolling Zhelezo ship that you see is
currently invested in another ship that its
interfacing with You make your way to the Open
Quay You make it to the docks
 All of you that are on there and youre
applying a disguise kit to Beau If you wouldnt
mind rolling a d add your dexterity modifier
and your proficiency modifier
 Yeah Yashas staying below and keeping an
eye on the rest of your crew With that youre
approached at the docks The dockmaster there
takes your document is going to inspect it and
rolled pretty well but you rolled a  He looks
and seems to be taken aback at how well designed
versus the occasional chicken scratch and heavily
stained ocean airtattered pieces of paper are
handed to him Seems to accept it and you guys
make your way onto the Open Quay docks Youre
there you drop anchor What do you wish to do
while youre here
 Oh plenty
 If anybody that would be the dockmaster
 Well thats in the other side Thats up at
the Restless Wharf
 Yes
 Okay you approach This is a human fellow
lanky with a very pronounced Adams apple and a
cleft chin Big sideburns and this mop of
reddishbrown hair a thick sweater on that
bunches up around the neck He turns back as you
approach Hi can I help you
 Youre on The Mistake
 Well theres two but Port Zoons the
closest
 Make a deception check
 He gives you a nod and goes to shake your
hand and goes Understood Slips the coin into
his hand All right in and out real quick Take the
paper folds it and hands it back to you
 For that youre probably going to look
outside of the Seafloors Bounty or probably on
the board at the Withered Bird Inn
 Seafloors Bounty or the Withered Bird Inn
 Welcome to the Open Quay What are you guys
doing while youre here
 Okay Thatd be a lot of additional rope
some repair materials for the ship maybe an
additional set of tools a couple of empty
barrels just in case you need them Actually
quite a few barrels if youre going to be buying a
lot more food because right now since they had
stocked up with what they had felt they needed
just for their crew and the short trip they were
making their way there if youre stocking up for
a while youre going to need more means of
transport and storage
 Perfect Okay It takes you a few hours but
you gather the materials that are needed The total
 cost for all of the materials together for
all of you is it food for a month as well
 For a month thats going to be about Id
say  gold
 If its good food for all of you guys and
the people that youre hiring on the crew to feed
all of you every day for a month
 Adequate food will put you at about 
gold
 Okay Its still better food than most
sailors have on long trips for that cost Thats
for you and the entire crew youre hiring and the
two you have on your ship for a month Okay so
you acquire that bit
 Ach ein Zemnian boy
 Augustus Gloop exactly
 Okay cool
 Glances at you glances at you glances
back Yeah if youre looking to hire youll
find most of them at either the posting at the
Seafloors Bounty or the Withered Bird Inn
 Yes but now both of you are informed
 So good luck
 Ugh
 Im so happy this campaign you guys have a
mostly deceptive illusorybased party This
really makes for a lot of shenanigans You guys
start looking for a crew to hire How many crew
are you looking to hire
 Crew of six You have two with you already
 A barrel keeper
 Youve worked as a boatswain before Thats
primarily what youve done as well as some
element of barrel keeping in your travels Those
are primarily what your skills would fall under
 Okay
 Make an investigation check
 Yes
 Ten Okay
 You find a few folk that are pretty good
so you hire pretty much for all the other positions
you need The navigators the one youre having a
hard time with Everyone youve talked to is like
Yeah I can sail the sea And youre like Hm
Nah Youre having a harder time finding a navigator
 All right Im assuming in this degree
youre going to these places to find these hires
as opposed to having to roleplay every interview
with each of these crewmen
 Thats true
 Yeah thats possible
 Kind of
 So whisper campaign One of you make a
deception check and one of you make an
investigation check
 Oh shit
  Thats pretty good
 There you go All right What whispers do
you want to disseminate
 All right As youre spreading this rumor
you start hearing people responding to that being
like Jawgrasp wasnt he found dead at the docks
the other night
 Hold on You do find out that a number of
the corpses that were gathered the two names that
you find are Captain Javeed Jawgrasp and Mattheus
Freecall They were both known criminals that had
bounties on their head In one hand there is a
search for or at least there is an understanding
that some unknown dogooders were responsible for
killing two people with bounties on their heads
However there was a blueskinned tiefling that
killed herself on the dock and people are trying
to find out information Theyre searching for the
body and theyre trying to find out who that was
Apparently a ship was taken from some of the
surviving crew of these people Youre getting the
idea that the guards didnt realize there was a
conflict happening and just assumed that whoever
took the boat you guys were members of this
Captain Jawgrasps crew
 All right Youve planted the seeds of this
ghost story on the docks In an attempt to coopt
the story of this blueskinned horned tiefling
youve also disseminated the information that
Jawgrasp died somehow in line with this ghost
story
 Well see if it sticks Youve set the
seeds
 Okay
 Okay Remember everything youve heard are
all been common rumors People just talking who
hear the whispers youre saying and the tales and
retorting with what theyve heard in the past
morning because there was hubbub People there are
discussing what they saw or heard about what happened
 But you havent seen any of the guards that
were present All right cool While thats
happening youre all still trying to find a
navigator
 Make an intelligence check
  Okay You have met one navigator
before
 Thats what I did its Orly
 I was waiting to see if youd pick up on
it
 Oh Thats going to cost you Caduceus
intelligence just went to eight
 From here Id say Carefully About an
hour
 Thats the first two Go
 
 No I know
 Yeah eight left
 Yep Theres a brief pause and eventually
you hear this voice come through Ill swing on
over Soon as I mmmuster the energy to finish
my breakfast
 Little time passes and sauntering up onto
the dock you see the massive waddling form of
the tortle with the sack over the shoulder The
rest of the deckhands look and give a nod Some
recognize him others are still like Fucking
tortles theyre weird Then eventually makes his
way to the ship over to the skiff and goes Oh
no you guys have the ship in dock You brought it
all in there He walks over and steps up onto the
gangplank So whom who am I talking to
 Hey there its real good to see you again
I heard from some mmmysterious magic voice that
you were going to hire someone to navigate
 How long you looking to need mmme
 I have no idea
 Im mmmighty confused but money
definitely drives so
 Weekly let me think  gold
 Make a persuasion check
 Yep
 Deal if I get to choose my quarters
 Mmmy quarters
 Then mmmy friend its a deal
 Begins walking up the gangplank and
then inflates the bag and 
announces his presence onto the ship as he arrives
 Yeah You know the more you hear it the
more youre like Eh its not that bad
actually Its the initial note that kicks in and
once you get used to it its not bad
 Yeah All right with your crew and supplies
acquired and
  possible seeds of whispers disseminated
some information gained about the scenario of
those that you killed on the dock the night
before and the knowledge that theyre still
searching for the rest of the crew you make your
way off the dock Are you going to try and pass by
the Zhelezo ship once more Because youre going
to have to to make your way out
 Actually with Orly hired and helping you
out with this Did you tell Orly you were trying
to avoid that ship
 Orly goes I think this helps me know what
kind of business we into Okay with advantage on
that Nice all right Quickly telling you All
right go now round about that way he begins
giving you the proper timing and based on your
previous information without issue you manage to
dodge the Zhelezo ship make your way to open
waters and now in the later afternoon you guys
have now exited the outskirts of Nicodranas Well
see how much of what youve left behind helps to
what you left behind the night before but
nevertheless you have a crew you have supplies
and you are on the water With that were going
to go ahead and take a break
 You hired the tortle
 Well I have to now You fucking hired him
I was thinking Im like They met a navigator

and well done Picking up where we left off as
Orly is on the ship Orly also brings with him a
map of the Menagerie Coast Because USPS is the
fucking worst
  it did not arrive in time the full one
so youll have to deal with this printout for the
time being but there is one on the way
 Pretty big

 I know Next week possibly at the live
show There we go That can be something for you
to reference for your travels on the Menagerie
Coast
 Oh Sam
  It is good for for
wedding materials as well yes
 Mighty Nein you have your crew
This is a pretty packed ship for a runner ship
because you have a full crew and then on top of
that you have you guys As opposed to training
as sailors youve hired more on top of what you
have so now you have a very busy ship However
you are out and about on the ocean What are
you guys going to do where are you going whats
the plan Orly needs something
 He compares it with the map and goes
Bbest I can tell its probably close to the
Inky Claw you know
 What
 From what you know partially because the
waters around there are very murky and very dark
so its hard to see where the reef comes close to
the surface A lot of the sea creatures that live
in the area tend to knock a lot of the silt up
thats close to the bottom of the reef which
means sometimes the reef sneaks up on you and
rakes across the bottom of the ship itself
 You can it just means that anything
thats off the trade routes means there is not a
lot of patrolling Zhelezo ships to maintain
protection for people that are using those lanes
It also means that sometimes as youve heard
certain creatures that live in the ocean or
nearby youre a little more susceptible to but
its a quicker route if where youre heading is
the Inky Claw
 Youre telling Orly to head to where
 Sea vines
 Yasha puts one hand in as well
 Orly corresponds and is like Just out of
personal curiosity why are we heading through the
reef Where are we going
 All right Well this captain youre talking
about mmmay be where that X is on the paper
 So thats putting us right by the island
 He points to just on the outskirts of the
X the land mass
 According to my map right here that is
Urukayxl
 Thats a real avoided locale
 Superstition Many folks around here they
talk about the dark stories of dense jungle and
very dangerous ironbearing creatures They talk
of strange ancient mmmasses and they talk of
wild unnatural types
 Not too familiar with that one but its
possible Mind you Im the navigator I aint
getting off the ship so thats all up to you
 Cant say I have
 Yasha actually approaches from the side
overhearing the conversation looks up to you
Caduceus and goes I know what its like to be
looking for some meaning Some guidance
Do you trust in your visions
 And you have strong faith in this thing you
follow
 Then if you ever go off the path maybe
theyll tell you You just have to keep looking
 Its kind of new to myself as well
 As you guys are
 Make a perception check
 No sign of the Professor You do have what
is it Sprinkle Sprinkle is still nestled up next
to you However your blink puppy Nugget still
remains with Marion back in Nicodranas
 Okay All right The evening comes quick by
the time you guys are leaving its not that far
from dusk and so your first evening out on your
new trajectory you have time What do you want to
send to Marion
 Are you using this across multiple spells
 She doesnt have the chance to respond to
the first one because you go right through to the
second but Marion does respond to the second and
goes Oh Well thank you for letting me know
Jester Be safe be bright and make me proud And
come back soon You and your friends Goodbye
All right whos keeping watch the first evening
Because now with a full crew you can go full
pace on this longship which will put you about 
miles per day Its about a  nautical mile
trip including through the reef with a full
crew That means itll put you there in a little
over three days about three and a half maybe
four days with careful passage through the reef
For the evening whos watch Okay And you have
crew who can take up as well if you want to So
one of you or both of you make a perception
check
  Okay During the evening you keep an
eye on the waves At some point the moon itself
is starting to find itself low in the sky and you
look over and you see this faint glow in the water
below You feel the back of your neck get warm for
a second and you glance over to try and inspect
what the source of this light is Its a jellyfish
bloom You see hundreds and hundreds of these tiny
jellyfish below the surface that are giving this
faint bioluminescent blues and pinks and variety
of colors in that pastel spectrum They pass under
the waves as you move by and you look out beyond
that and you can see a few more For the next hour
or so you look over the water and pass by these
beautiful little beacons of color in the middle of
this dark black ocean
 The remainder of the evening goes thankfully
uneventful The blooms fade as you pass through
the evening mating grounds of these jellyfish The
next day comes the morning comes and your first
true ontheocean breakfast kicks in Thankfully
because of supplies that were purchased there are
a number of fresh meats available A proper
breakfast can be made You can see through the
crew that youve hired theyre quite surprised by
the quality of food theyre given on this journey
Theres a bit of like a Damn now Im glad I
agreed to this journey They take some food and a
couple of them are like
 Hilariously Marius is actually a
vegetarian
 He is Hes like Ill probably partake in
that too if thats all right
 This is delicious
 Theyre crazy arent they
 Whats going to happen are they going to
let me go you think
 If worst comes to worst we cut and run
huh You and me
 Okay thanks
 Once again very good
 Continuing on your journey whos keeping
watch for this next day
 All right so either you guys roll individually
or one of you with advantage your choice
 Go for it
 Yeah
  Okay good
 Okay since Orly is the navigator helping
you out and are you leading this are you guiding
the boat are you the captain of this
 You didnt hire a captain and they need to
be hired by somebody so one of you needs to be
the captain
 You generally dont hire a captain for the
ship like hey were just a bunch of assholes
with a boat We need to hire someone to be our
leader and pay us
 Whats your captain name to your crew
 They need to have to know who their captain
is who theyre going to go towards
 Captain Tusktooth There we go Theyre very
confused because there are no tusks visible on Tusktooth
 Good to know Captain Tusktooth All righty
 No this was throughout the day
 The crews keeping watch too but this is
keen eyes and occasionally going up to climbing
the sail a bit to get a good view or climbing the
mast to keep an eye out
 Roll a survival check with advantage for
Orlys help as the navigator To keep us on task
and in the proper direction
 Youre going to pick up some speed
actually
 Captain Tusktooth already out of the gate
acting like a captain and the crews coming
together For all of you who watched the fuckery
that was you trying to get out and then back to
port the night before seeing a full crew on the
ship knowing what theyre doing youre like Oh
Yeah Its probably good you hired this crew
 Yes
 Oh no
 Every time
 It is technically a monk weapon the index
finger
 Your guys day shift goes by keeping watch
Nothing really catches your attention its just
open shores and open waters Since youre off the
trade route path there dont appear to be any
other ships passing back and forth It feels
comforting to be so alone in some ways but for
some of you its strangely isolating There may
be a few moments throughout the next few days
where you have to go below deck and not
conjecture you especially Caduceus This is
 Day two and day three start getting a little
hard on you to weve been traveling for  hours
and literally everything looks exactly the same
 Okay For the evenings watch on the second
day or this is technically the end of the first day
 Both of you guys roll for your perception
  okay You continue on through the
evening uneventful
  Finishing your watch uneventful
As the evening comes in other folks can take a
shift or you can leave it to any of your crew
You dont have to take every shift but you have
to rely on your crew to keep a watch
 Any plans for the evening
 This would be night yeah Youve been
captaining the ship for a full day
 Okay You get the sense that the fish would
be happy to as they
 No its great
 You lean over the side of the boat and
talking to the fish that pass by you get the
sense that its like  Sure

 Theyre nowhere near as fast as the ship so
within the sphere of perception that a fish has
the ones that are now far behind you will definitely
let you know when you come across something
 I know And I love playing that element
 Okay
 Sure It drags through the water like any
other blade would
 No it doesnt react
 Okay Falchions back whence it came
 Are you keeping watch
 Make a perception check for me
 Okay nothing for the evening Okay As
youre focusing on your blade on the side of the
boat as it gets close to midnight let me
actually roll for the crew as well Nope okay As
you are checking your blade and looking around
you hear this sound that catches your ear Its
like  but its up Glancing up to the
left of your vision and theres a shape thats
sitting up on one of the sails
 Just a dark shape sitting up there on the
sail
 Its not moving
 As you whistle you see it has two wings
and it and takes off into the dark night
 It looked humanoidish
 As far as sizewise it looked like a human
You saw big wings and you saw legs dangling It
looked like a bird but it was humansized
 Yashas asleep You go down and Yasha sits
up As soon as you enter the room the chamber
that Yasha has
 Before you even get to that point the sound
of the door opening Yashas like 
 Be careful Beau Puts the blade and leans
it against the side of the cot and leans back
 Grabs the sword and gets back up and walks
past you and up the stairs
 Perception check with disadvantage because
this is looking into far darkness
 Just in casies sure But still at
disadvantage
 Glancing out it looks like at this point
the moon is just starting to vanish in the
distance so theres not a lot of light and it
looks like a black endless void around the ship
with just a faint image of a blue line as a
horizon in all directions
 Sure
 You make your way up Go ahead and make an
investigation check
 You look and you can see its dry
weathered wood this mast has been in use for a
while You do see what appear to be some grooves
like large talons
 Okay As the lights drift out at that
moment you watch as a series of shapes swoop in
 In that instant you watch as a
cluster of harpies not coming towards you are
now coming in and divebombing the sails Theyre
rushing in and trying to drag their claws through
to put you dead in the water From a narrative
standpoint go ahead and roll initiative
 All right  to 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah thats a 
 All right  for Beau  to 
 Ooh look at that
 Yep Jester Caduceus Yasha  to ten
 Nott Fjord and then Caleb youre last
 All right Harpies rolled a natural  on
their initiative roll
 With their plus one thats a  so theyre
going first You watch as six harpies come
swooping in Two of them land up on top and
getting a view of who alls on the ship The few
crew that are currently running the deck start
shouting Harpies and they start running
Theyre not hired to fight and they go charging into
the cabin below Theyre both looking towards the
guys who are running and theyre both going to swoop
down and see if they can go over to the deckhands
 No not yet Those two havent One of
thems going to swoop down thats cocked No
not with a six Manages to try and harry the guy
and he kicks it off manages to push through The
other one dives down to grab a second one Does
manage to do so Claws sink in not doing a whole
lot of damage but you watch as it grips into and
begins lifting one of the deck hands Hes three
or four feet off the ground and hes like
 and the harpys lifting him up Three
of the others are going to tear through the sails
and one of them is about to land on the poop deck
on the back towards the stern of the ship The
three are going to try to sweep across the sails
Yeah thats a hit Thats a hit
 Thats a miss One of them attempts to try
and grab towards the sail but the way the wind is
blowing it cant actually get a hold of it and
only does a slight tear on the side The other
two however with their claws seven  points
of damage to that sail You hear the tearing sound
as they both drag a series of open tears across
the central sail on the main mast You watch as
the sail  the ships starting to slow
a little bit in that process The one that lands
in the back of the ship stops wings out inhales
and this voice begins to emerge this strange
baleful  this weird ghostly voice
that seems to emanate and then grow into its own
chorus its like a dirge almost as it spreads
out into the space I need everybody to make a
wisdom saving throw
 Great
 Thats a success
 Success
 Fail
 Success
 Success Roll for Yasha if you dont mind
One of you
 Everyone succeeds You hear this and you
feel this weird faint grasp in your brain this
song beginning to placate your adrenaline but
then you shrug it off except for Nott Nott you
are charmed by this harpy You listen to this
music and its beautiful You find yourself all
the tension leaving your body and you cant focus
on anything else Youre just watching it there
You guys watch as Notts arms drop her weapon
going limp to her side her head turned slightly
towards one shoulder and smiling listening to
this song One of the crew thats not currently
being held by the harpy almost makes it into the
lower cabin and then stops dead in his grasp and
is also entranced by the song The harpy continues
to sing All right Beau youre up first
 No the sail is not completely destroyed
and it could be repaired should they not continue
to pull it apart
 It looks like it
 You can give it a shot All right You have
done a little bit of sail work Id say make a
quick intelligence check Having not been formally
trained necessarily well see if you can
 Yeah in your time on the ship and studying
how the different elements of the ship maneuver
together to create motion and riding the wind you
figure out that one of the various ropes you pull
and release and will cause the sail to entirely
come down or you could just pull it up and cause
it to no longer be unfurled
 Probably pull it in You grab the rope and
pull it up Both the harpies are curving around
for another series of attacks on it but youre
pulling that element of the sail up
 You can Your arm holds the rope in place
and you get yourself ready in case anything
happens That finishes your go Jester youre
up
 Go for it
  hits
 Theyre not very hard to hit They dont
have a lot of armor if at all Theyre more just
a little dexterous but other than that you see
these harpy forms You see these humanoid female
lithe bodies naked but their legs curl into
these taloned hawklike feet They have these
sets of wings that come off of it and their long
stringy hair Their faces are littleit goes
beautiful to grotesque where the mouth itself seem
almost like the lips are shrunk and shriveled and
series of sharpened broken teeth are visible from
where they open their mouth
  damage
 All right What is
 Natural one No
 You see the impact of the spiritual weapon
the large spinning lollipop cracking into her
face The song stops for a second and the blast
of divine energy in the middle of her head sets
her off but she pushes through and continues the
song Looks pretty hurt and is wondering what to
do next That finishes your turn Jester
 Yeah youre up at the top looking down and
the two harpies that are spinning back they
definitely noticed you casting these spells
 You can try to reach for something
 Ill say you hold onto a rope sure Thatll
be your movement Okay that finishes Jesters
turn Caduceus
 What are you attempting to do here
 I will say because technically
 Well no there is no saving throw if theyre
suppressing it So it just happens Suddenly the
song thats entrancing you you shake out of it as
Caduceus finishes muttering this phrase and you
feel the clarity come to your mind once more
 This also affects the other deckhands
 The mass of winged beetles begin to clatter
out in a cloud
 Okay They rush in there
 Go ahead and make an attack Its a d
 Yeah thatll definitely hit That is d
 Yeah Ill make a print out Remind me to make
a print out for you since this is having a hard time
 I know
 Yeah it is d
  points of damage
 Okay The beetles are now swarming this
harpy whos taken bludgeoning It is now bleeding
profusely and you can only see part of her torso
and shes like  The song is dropped
and now is trying to fly away as shes picking up
her wings as these beetles are now tearing into
her flesh That ends your turn Caduceus
 Yashas turn Theres the two that are up on
top darting down to pick up the guy The one
thats currently holding the other deckhand
Yashas going to rush forward since its
technically within her melee range Shes going to
rush forward and take two strikes If someone
wants to roll for her
 Go for it
 All righty The ten hits the one does not
 All right No its d actually
 Go for it
 Great okay
 Yasha carves through a large chunk of it
The harpy still holds onto the deckhand but is
unable to make a drop This brings us to Nott and
Fjord
 Currently there is the one holding the
deckhand that Yasha just attacked
 Go for it
 That hits
 Theyre not very armored or dexterous
creatures
  points of damage nice Blasts You see
it has to right itself shes flapping her wings
but still holding on and trying now desperately to
just get away Theres no attempt to interface
she has her quarry and is about to bolt
  just hits
 Eight points of damage Yeah thatll do it
As its flying away it gets about ten or so feet
up and the deckhand is screaming Ah Help me
 The bolt hits it spins in the air a
cluster of feathers then slams down hard on the
deck of the ship The deckhand also hits and
rolls and hits the side of the ladder that leads
up to the poop deck Hes like  and now
starting to freak out looking at the other harpies
that are circling Theres still five of them
 Ah
 All right Fjord
 Okay
 That hits
 Both hit
 Ten points of damage on the first one
 All right You turn around glancing up at
them release that one blast of eldritch energy
that crackles and spins slamming into each of
them up in the air and lights up the sky above
the mast You can see through the diffusing of the
impacts behind the sails on the opposite side of
the deck for those of you on the other end of the
ship As both of them spin into a circle taking
pain from the impact but then right themselves
looking down to the source of this angry
aggressive act
 All right That brings us to Caleb
 With your movement it would be half speed
and Id say for you whos not a necessarily an
accomplished climber it would be an athletics
check
 The mast would go up probably   feet
 Both of them
 Anything within  feet of Caleb
 That would get three of them The one that
failed to grab the other guy is just out of range
 Theres five left technically
 There were six total Ones died one of
thems close to death and there are two wounded
and two that have been untouched
 Thats a failure Thats a failure And
thats a success The one that had missed one of
the deckhands and is on an upswoop doesnt seem
affected The two by the mast immediately as the
glyph completes and theres this very subtle
burst of dark dullgreen shadow energy that
emanates from you Both of them  and
are going to start getting the fuck out of Dodge
All right that ends your turn Caleb
 Back to the top of the round harpies Those
two harpies full dash full run go spinning back
in the direction they came As far away from you
as they can get
 Those two for the time being are out of
the way Lets see if they can make their save Nope
 Thats true yeah
 Yeah facing away doesnt matter Yeah no
theyre still running
 Okay Theres the one on the back thats
near death its going to attempt to fly away as
well Its going to move and dash Thats  feet
out and its trying to catch up with the other
two Now theres three of them fleeing That one
that one and that one All right The two that
are attacking theres two that are attacking the
mast One picked him one one thats singing I
know Im trying to remember where it is Okay
yeah There we go Theres the one that tried to
grab the one deckhand its going to swoop down
and try and grab him again because he hasnt made
his way fully in Does manage to grab him Swoops
down only gets partial only  feet up with him
Thats its turn Lets see the other two are
going to go ahead Two are fleeing Thats
fleeing Oh theres only one thats free That
one is going to attempt to attack one of the other
sails because theres multiple sails up at that
point A smaller one You know what No its
going to come after you since youre the one
thats holding the sail Its going to swoop down
and attack you with claws
 That is a actually surprising an 
 I think that misses you Oh its at
disadvantage too because you have your
 Yes Second attack Yeah misses with both
 Its going to attempt to move  feet away
from you with the rest of its movement
 Go for it Make an attack
 Yeah that hits
 All righty
 And it cannot move Its less of a punch but
more of like with your open hand you grab the back
her leg and slam the harpy on the edge of the boat
It gets dragged down and thrust down on the edge
of the railing and crack a rib and its trying to get
out of your grasp and it manages to pull free
but now is right there next to you Couldnt get
much further You get the sense now that theyre
retreating This was a quick harrying They didnt
expect quite so much resistance and most of
them are wanting to get the hell out With that
knowledge Beau its your turn
 I love it Go ahead and make your two
attacks
 Thats correct Go ahead and roll damage for
each
  points of damage Both kicks whack
whack to the harpy as shes trying to get back up
on the air ends up knocking her back onto the
deck 
 Still up and is now is going to continue to
try and make an escape
 Yeah roll damage
 Ten damage total
 With the next hit you go ahead and just
punch past the face and then with the other hand
you wrap the rope around her throat then release
You watch the tension of the sail as it unfurls
and snaps the neck of the harpy and drags her up
and is now dangling from the rope as the sail is
now unfurled again still torn
 That finishes up Beaus turn Jester youre
up
 Okay go for it
 Yes roll damage
 That was the first time that its been
wounded It gets hit by the large spiritual
lollipop as its trying to carry off the deckhand
still holding on
 Okay go for it Its quite a ways away and
you can see it 
 Yeah definitely within  feet so go
ahead and roll for the attack on that
 Level one
 It looks pretty hurt
 Yeah its your spell attack bonus The same
as your spiritual weapon
 d
 Seven points of damage As you bring the
spiritual weapon down you turn to see the other
one flying away You release the bolt of vibrant
radiant energy It streaks off right as its
flying heading it off You quickly aim watching
its arc and as it flies away 
 You watch this burst of light as its
body tumbles and sploosh into the ocean water
below Jester that finishes your turn Caduceus
youre up
 Correct its been hit once
 It cant get close enough unfortunately
 Yeah the other harpy pulled away from it
It can move closer but its not going to
 Okay
 All right
 Caduceus looking at the swarm turns
around holds the staff in the air towards the one
taking off with one of your deckhands and when you
saw the bright beam
 Ooh Spins around and releases a far heavier
and brighter burst of light that streaks into and
blasts into the harpy wobbles in the air for a
second The energy explodes and is now spinning
keeping this weird shifting like an atom spin
around the outside of its body The next attack
has advantage because of Guiding Bolt Its
looking pretty hurt too
 That finishes Caduceuss round
 No not yet
 Yashas turn Yasha it just grabbed him
and is trying to pull away Yashas I dont
think Yashas close enough to hit and melee it it
pulled him up too high
 Yeah shes not going to do that
 Yeah thats not happening Theres not much
Yasha can do right now
 Not really Sorry Yashas going to get
underneath though and prepare in case it does get
knocked down a peg or whatever just gets the
sword at the ready and is eyeballing it angrily
and is going to rage because thats fun All right
that brings us to Nott and Fjord
 You do have disadvantage though because
its out of your firing range although you can
probably move up closer and get within range Its
up to you you can do that
 Yes
  does hit but
 Go ahead and roll damage
 Not technically  its holding yeah and
its not even an ally whos in combat with it so
 Seven points of damage all right arrow
sound Still flying
 Yeah
 Thatll do it

 And all out of hit points So 
the second one you watch as it goes pained
sounds and it begins to just careen down towards
the edge of the ship
 Its about to slam well see theres a
percentage chance here
 Im going to roll a percentile dice to see
if it hits either on the deck or over the edge
No it hits on the deck
  chance of either It crashes in to the
other guy slams in to the side of the railing
manages to pull free and catches up with the other
guy as they both run inside the ship At this
point the other harpies now are just
 Bugging out and fleeing
 At the moment by the time your spell would
wear off there are none to be seen
 Sure
 Okay Well Caleb just for the sake of it
roll a deception check
 Just out of curiosity
 Caleb is having a rough  a terrible 
yeah all right so just so are you 
 Yeah its super uncomfortable Caleb
 No sign of any harpies
 It takes a short time but you manage to in
the next ten minutes or so feel comfortable that
youve mended most of what the harpies had done
 The two crew that you hired who already
rushed in there are in the process of telling
the story of what they just saw Theyre like
And then there was a blasting light up there
It was crazy
 You notice half of them go Yeah
 No And the other half are like Blintzes
 Two of them
 Go ahead and make a general medicine check
 Ill say with disadvantage because youre
not too familiar with the body of a harpy
 You butcher it Thats a gameyass harpy
You do get some meat To you it looks delicious
but everyone else youre like Im good You
get like a pound
 Okay
 Its pretty sinewy
 You guys bought a number of barrels You
filled a lot of them
 Owl Frumpkin is fine
 
 Good to keep that in mind As you bring your
things in for the evening that comes to a close
your second full day of travel now the following
morning comes to bear Whos keeping watch for
this day
 Make a perception check for me please
  okay For the day you dont see
anything You do no you dont see anything
Okay Ocean All wide ocean
 Yeah what are you doing with your barrel
 Okay so you just begin to Decompose
 Youll find out Itll be a little while
You watch as the start of various fungus and fuzzy
mold begins to appear at edges of its corpse
Youve started it a couple days maybe youll
have something that will give you an idea what is
growing
 Next evening All right go ahead and make a
perception check
  Okay Make your survival check for me as
the captain please With advantage because you
have Orly on board
 Thats successful youre not picking up any
additional speed like you were the day before
okay uneventful At one point you pass by a few
small rock islands bits of stone that are
breaking through the surface too far away to make
any details Theyre not large one set appears to
be maybe ten  feet across the other one looks
to be about  or so feet across Just little
breaks in the water where a little mass of stone
has breached but thats all you can make out The
evening goes by uneventful By the third day the
morning comes around Orly comes up to the top
comes to you and goes Excuse me Captain Im
keeping tabs on our travels southward I can see
the reef is approaching
 There are different see those Y marks
Each one of those is going to be a survival check
to try and maneuver the boat through the reef
 Yes because you have Orly with you and
Orly is working with you side by side holding up
the map and looking at the scenery A lot of the
crews on the deck as well keeping eyes out
 You have your Fragment of Possibility
 Yes with advantage For the first one
 You guys can now see at first it just
looks like open water but then as you begin to
maneuver past the first section looking down 
feet  feet ten feet some of them barely
breaching the surface you can see these colorful
reefs that are full of vibrant life all sorts of
manner of sea creatures and fish going through
and within a very short distance you can see
broken wood You can see other ships the remnants
of which have been scattered across the reef and
have since been overgrown Carefully making your
way through this gap you manage to curve slightly
one bit the back of your stern scrapes at one
point on one edge but any damage would be
superficial and you manage to maneuver past where
you can see one set of sticks that have been tied
together and embedded into the reef just below
just barely peeking past breaking the surface
And thats the first sign you see of one of those
points
 Now that youve seen it thats going to be
your guiding point for each portion of this reef
You and Orly both going through and traversing
this you can see the next path before you Both
of you together go ahead and make another
survival check with advantage
 All right roll one more You only roll one
more so pick one and roll it
 Total is a ten
 All right then As you make your way through
the next portion of the reef turning it over you
hear it impact a heavy portion of the reef scraping
across it The ships hull does take damage
 Okay that is  points of hull damage
Eventually pulls past and dislodges from the
 reef Looking behind you can see parts of it
that are broken and falling in and pieces of wood
that have been dragged off and splintered The crew
rushes down inside and making an investigation
check pretty high they do not see any damage
to the hull thats taking on water but that was
not a happy thing You do not know how many more
of those type of hits youll take before the ship
begins to take on water and they cant do repairs
to the hull unless its in a port of some kind
 You have no visual perspective on it All
the damage is below the surface of the water
 Just in case Okay
 Keeping low All right so thats the
second one Youre marking each of these
that you pass by
 Were on the third
 Go ahead and try again now
 Okay The channel youve made your way
through in the reef is getting narrower and you
can see elements of the reef are beginning to
vanish into just jutting pieces of stone It looks
like in a weird way from a distance like a
series of gravestones Familiar to you as you pass
by as bits of rock are breaking the surface some
at odd angles and there were semblances of stone
spires that naturally jut from underneath the
water that the reef is built on over time The
channel gets thinner here but thankfully after
that last hit you dig deep in yourself and be
like No Ive seen ships go through this Im
getting the feel for this whole captain thing
and between you and Orly communicating you manage
to just make it through the channel At a point
all of you hold your breath as you see elements of
the reef that should be wide enough to put maybe a
ship thats slightly larger than the one you have
in but with even just a small narrow margin of
failure here you wouldve ground against the side
of one or the other side You cut straight through
perfectly balancing on both sides coming past
the third marker beneath the surface this one
breaking through about a foot past the water As
you spin around you guys begin to just barely see
the shadowed landmass of an island beginning to
appear as your destination As you come to the
final portion of the reefs channel go ahead and
make your final check
  You come through the last portion of
this Its a very tight location and you and Orly
look back and forth You may have been a little
off in the portion of the reef you thought you
were supposed to take through this broken channel
and as you do it seems fine and youre looking
at the front of the ship a bunch of them gathered
at the bow and look over both on port and
starboard side and go I think well be all
right 
 Grinds over a portion of the reef the ship
jolts It wasnt a hard hit Youre just grinding
over the top of it and youre breaking a lot of
the reef right there in the process of doing so
You dont take as much damage as the last hit but
you do take some damage Thats a bad roll You
take nine more hull damage With that Jester
 water begins to pour in from the side
This is less of just mending a small object this is
structural hull damage
 A single break or tear in an object you
touch Mending is not going to help you with this
 Gallan and anybody who wants to come help
the hull is now taking on water
 Okay What are you doing to help block it
 Its essentially a one oneandahalf foot
long break and the wood is torn away its broken
apart and theres a gap where the waters now
pouring in
 Make a perception check real fast as you
glance around the chamber
 Looking around theres some of the barrels
and in the various quarters of the interior of the
ship theres some cots and theres some sacks and
whatever supplies people brought with them
Nothing comes to mind looking around Youre kind
of panicking All the rest of the crew are
suddenly coming down theyre starting to get a
bucket chain trying to just get water out of
there as they have no idea at the moment Gallan
gets his tools starts looking around for whatever
scrap materials they had purchased Youre now an
inch of water in the bottom of the ship Anyone
else doing anything to help here
 You guys are slowing the water coming on
board
 You can certainly try
 Yeah Yasha goes and grabs the other side of
the barrel and both of you go try and force and
hold it there
 All right How much time
 I need you to go ahead and make a strength
check with Yashas help with advantage
  You hold the barrel over and it seals
 Youre holding it there but its
spraying around the edges The barrel immediately
fills and youre now trying to cork the hole with
this barrel and its just  all
around you
 Theyre less mattresses in the ship There
are cots There is actually a mattress in the
captains quarters Theres the one mattress
 Is that what youre doing
 Yeah and you can walk on the surface if you
choose to
 You can stand on the surface and then
below
 You get below and you get the mattress
what do you do
 Okay make a perception check because its
under the water and youre not entirely certain
where theres a large scrape section where a lot
of the reef pulled against the hull
  yeah Glancing down as youre about to
go help you look and you can see of all the
damage thats taken thats superficial theres
one section where it looks like a heavy groove is
carved out from that last impact and there you
can see this faint shift of the water pouring
through that gap You take and hold down the
mattress and it pulls against it Its there in
place the suctions holding it Youre not sure
how long itll hold there without anything holding
it in place
 Gallan at this point has his tools and
starts handing out nails left and right He
brought an additional set of tools so two of you
can
 While youre brightening that Gallans over
there Hes hammering in the nails
 Two barrels down pulled apart to get
materials to try and patch this
 Crows nest is the very top
 Okay Looking good
 All right great Youre there Because the
ship is still moving youre having to hold it in
place while walking on the side It seems to be
holding itself okay for the time being just from
the pressure of the water but its starting to
slide off as it goes Its a weird scenario where
now that its blocking the section theres no
suction theres just the pressure of the water
but as it moves it is sliding along with it
 All right Jester youre helping out with
the repairs Make a general d check
 I lost that d Ill pick that up later
Oh Natural  on Gallans turn If you needed
that any time its fucking now
 Gallan sees you mucking up  Let
me do it hold on Heres how you place it over
fuck it Shit He does it himself He goes to
town and earns his keep since he arrived here
One by one begins taking the best parts of the
barrel that Yasha helped him break begins holding
it in place Hold this here He starts nailing
it down Eventually over the  or so minutes it
takes for him to cast the spell he patches it in
a way where hes like  This will
hold for a little bit But were going to
have Whyd I go Scottish there for a second
This will hold for a little bit I dont know how
long Were going to have to figure out some way
to fix this get it to shore or something
  Okay
 As youre walking alongside the boat its
going to pick up speed a little bit here Youre
going to have to either have to let this mattress
go or find a way to keep it in place What are you
going to do
 Okay The mattress slides away and you see
water  Its a slow leak It is still
taking on water but slowly
 Its a patch job When Caleb returns he can
tell us what the fuck he was planning with the spell
 The crew now rapidly getting the water out
of the bottom of the cargo hold Theyre throwing
it overboard You gather with the slow leak in
the next couple hours theyll be able to minimize
the amount of water thats below there
 You guys are now turning towards the island
and its an open bay now You passed the reef and
youre heading towards the island of Urukayxl
 Make a perception check
  No dock but you do see another ship
  minutes as theyve try to makeshift plug
the hole Its a slow leak still but theyve
managed to hold it off
 I would say you know what thats clever
I will say if you choose not to let the ocean in
it will not
 There you go
 It is yeah
 Id say its
 Theyre about maybe as youre breaking
past the reef theyre a few miles away
 Its possible If you can see them with your
naked eye theres a chance theyve seen you but
you dont know You have no way to confirm that
 You just noticed them you dont see any
motion yet Youd probably have to try and
gauge it over a period of time
 You are covering that Youve given that
information to Orly and hes like All right
Ill keep to that way there He begins to lead you
in that direction you move the ship that way
Keeping watch as youre shifting around Are you
going south or north side Youre heading south
towards the island as you went through
the reefs so now youre on the northwestern
side of the island
 Okay its a little bit north of where
youre headed
 Youre cruising and youre keeping an eye
closely you watch as the ship was stationary
begins to move in the direction youre traveling
 All right
 In pushing the ship ahead as fast as you can
with the hole plugged towards the south side of the
island in the attempt to beach it as you continue
the ship is moving to head you off at the pass
 Eventually you start getting a closer look
at it and its a bigger ship than the one you
have now Its dual mast
 Well make a perception check
TRAVIS Yeah 
 You look and you dont see any and then you
do because one of them opens You watch as one of
the gun ports 
 Okay as you get situated you hear cannon
explosion  but a ways away
 Yeah It is a warning shot
 Youre going to keep going
 Oh youre probably at this point about a
mile and a half two miles
 Yeah its quite a distance from the island
you notice it as you go to move Its quite a ways
 Okay You slow the ship do you come to a
stop
 All right The ship you bring it slowly
down Do you drop anchor
 As youre watching off to the side you can
see all the gun ports are open now But you see
two smaller boats that are now coming towards you
from the other ship You can see two separate
small crews that are rowing in your direction
 The other ship has maneuvered up to the
point where it is now its full starboard side is
facing you full gun ports open Youre in a bad
position
 Make a perception check
 There is one sail that is currently
partially unfurled But from this distance it
looks like its facing away from you from the
direction youre looking so you cant make out
any details on it But there is some sort of
stitching in it
 Yeah you do have the ships flag up above
the Mistake As these row boats steadily make
there way towards your ship the moment of
possible parley approaching were going to end
the episode there Well pick up there for our
live show in New York next week
 No you guys were in the Feywild You fought
a feymire crocodile there
  You should Sam
 Careful guys youre making promises the
internet live right now
 On that note guys
 Thank you Backblaze Thank you DD Beyond
Thank you guys for coming along with us for a
crazy nautical adventure this week
 We love you and in tougher times we love
you a lot Have a wonderful week Well see you
next Thursday and is it Thursday yet Good
night

 Perfect there we go Welcome back Last we
left off The Mighty Nein in following a thread
of information that may tie into some aspect of
Fjords curious history after he chestvored a
sphere discovered that apparently a group of
individuals were hired to retrieve this and bring
it to a Captain Avantika Upon following this
thread you found your way to the city of
Nicodranas on the Menagerie Coast outside the
Dwendalian Empire You met up with Yasha once
more you happened to take care of a man who was
bothering Jesters mother Very thoroughly Upon
coming upon this character Marius LePual who
youve been following you got into an altercation
at the docks and accidentally took their boat
However you managed to sneak your way back to
Nicodranas the following day before it seemed
there was much of an uproar searching for you You
stealth hired a crew including bringing Orly the
tortle bard on as your navigator and made your
way out to sea towards this island called Urukaxl
that you believed may have been the one based on
this piece of a map that you had recovered within
the ship The Mist You changed the name of the
ship to The Mistake You became Captain Tusktooth
was it
 Following the map you made your way through
the reef taking on a bit of water briefly but
thankfully through some ingenuity some quick
repairs and the tenuous use of a magical tent
you kept it from sinking and going towards the
shoreline of Urukaxl there appeared to be another
ship a larger ship waiting in the nearest bay
Upon attempting to possibly make your way around
it to run it aground the ship seemed to be
cutting you off and fired a warning cannon shot
across the bow You decided it was best to stop
and began to gather yourselves as two small
rowboats were making their way towards the outside
of The Mistake to whatever ends that may come to
Caleb are you still below deck holding onto your
spell
 Good Because I believe that is where we
left off Mighty Nein as you see these two small
boats slowly rowing their way towards you from the
far side of the bay what do you do
 Thankfully the intelligent creature managed
to swoop up before hitting the surface of the
ocean there Frumpkin continues to head off
towards the other ship At this point in time the
rest of the rowboats travel just about to reach
the bottom of The Mistake
 Well yeah as youre waiting here If
theres anything else you want to prepare in the
meantime I know you had said you changed your
form to look like the previous captain
 No you were far away
 Yeah It was less that you were far away and
more that you were in the water and then made a
thunder strike and then were far away and then
he was paralyzed
 Sorry
 Mmhmm
 You can certainly try yeah
 Okay I envision like the anime girl where
like all of a sudden the eyes are covered in shadow
 Yeah perfect
 All right

 Anybody else
 Make a perception check
 Theyre getting pretty close so its not a
terrible DC at this point in time There are two
figures in one boat and a very large figure in the
other alone One of the boats is like sinking in
the water or not really sinking but is
definitely pushing towards the boundaries of
buoyancy The other boat however seems to carry
two figures one looks to be a female a little
older maybe in s or s the other figure seems
to be the one thats rowing
 I will say you cannot quite make out that
detail from this distance
 Are you lowering any of the rope ladders
or
 You got it Yasha
 At this point you hear the two dull 
of the two other small rowboats hitting the bottom
of the ship and you hear the climbing up the side
of the boat Eventually emerging the first thing
you see is one giant meaty hand come over the top
of the side of the ship and rising up you see a
haggard female ogre You see stringy greasy hair
thats peeling in front of the face obscuring
part of one eye the other one looks to be a bit
clouded You can see these like streaks of dark
what wouldve been possibly makeup and beyond
that a leather tunic and these thick rippling
muscular arms She eventually gets over the side
of the ship and then puts her hand over and helps
the other two up One of them appears to be a
gentleman probably in his late s mostly bald
a little bit of hair on the sides a light blond
and he seems to be a little more demure compared
to the two Immediately his gait and presence
seems to be more of at least a lower position on
the hierarchy of the other ship The last one that
comes up is the woman that you saw This woman
shes a tougherlooking middleaged woman
thicker heftier body weathered face Shes
wearing tattered robes but beneath that there is
a set of leather armor there is a cutlass to one
side and she has this small amulet thats
dangling from a heavy chain around the neck
 As they step up the ogre looks around at
the rest of you and grins with this broken toothy
glare  The woman clears her throat and
addresses you You are requested to the bows of
The Squalleater immediately
 It is recommended by the captain that you
immediately make your way across with whatever
boats you have available Theres a space for some
with us but should you decline or make any move
outside of complete and utter compliance you and
your ship will sink
 She turns to you with like an intense glare
and goes Jawgrasp you seem to have sustained
some sort of terrible wound
 Make a deception check with advantage
 If you come with whatever your most
immediate crew is and she looks about and says
And it would appear that youve lost most of your
previous crew
 So you bring unproven individuals into our
plans
 The woman glares back and forth across the
troupe of you and goes Well then some of you
come onto the ship the rest take it into shore
with Bouldergut Points to the ogre and the ogre
goes  To shore
 Do you not have a ship of yourself
 You have a rowboat
 Then come please She immediately starts
to climb down with the help of Bouldergut the
ogre Down into one boat the helper that she was
with goes down with her and there are now the two
rowboats and the rowboat that you have at your
disposal It looks like the ogre is staying
onboard to help whoevers behind take The Mistake
to shore
  Big big grin The rest of the
crew who has known you for three days goes like Huh
They start getting the ropes ready start pulling
the anchor up
 Okay As youre sitting there concentrating
with all this going on the tension of what we
were just told by Fjord a moment ago you watch as
Nott runs down to grab you
 Okay you watch as this sphere immediately
vanishes as you exit the exterior of it and what
brief repairs were placed against there seem to
hold for the time being There is a slow leak You
do see it is taking on water but it is at the
moment a trickle
 In the rest of this journey when you came
out of the reef Gallan had done his best to
repair it but theres only so much you can patch
something like that It may hold for a while who
knows Gallan literally as this is happening sees
the leak and goes like Okay you know this is
it should work As long as we dont stay out here
for too long I think well be okay
 Great perfect Have fun wherever youre
going
 You said something about pirates
 Make a deception check
 He goes Oh I mean I hate fucking rats
 Im glad you took care of them That gets
real bad as far as the food stores down here in
the cargo hold Thank you for that
 All right toodaloo Sits down and gets
himself an orange unaware
 All right You guys make your way back to
the deck of the ship
 Okay good to know
 I hope thats written in your inventory
 All right so are you all getting in the
boats or are some of you staying behind
Whats the plan
 All righty All of you make your way down
into one of the three boats and begin rowing your
way across this gulf to the ship Now as you
approach this ship you can see its a massive
trimast ship You can see where those doors were
open there are large heavy cannons facing your direction
 Yeah Im so proud of you
 From the gun ports on the gun deck or the
tween deck as its sometimes called

 Anyway so as you make your way towards
this massive ship the large rope I want to say
a ladder more than a giant netlooking ladder is
thrown over the side that hits and breaks the
surface for a bit so that it floats The boats
come up to the side and the older woman is inside
the boat gives a look to the rest of you and
goes After you
 All right
 As you guys are climbing you see The
Mistake is now being led over towards shore You
make your way to the top of the deck and as you
come across one by one you see there waiting for
you is about ten figures all in various scattered
bits of seafaring attire leathers and billowing
cloths that seem to have seen many a journey out
here on the open Lucidian Ocean Immediately your
attention is grabbed by the central figure a
female elf with light brown skin with red wild
hair that falls in clustered strings around her
face and down the back You see shes wearing a
long sleeveless gray coat with a high collar that
bends at the edge of the shoulders with a thick
scarf around her neck You see she has heavy
elbowlength gloves and kneehigh boots that look
weathered with use and probably brutality They
are stained in places where that could only have
been acquired by meeting the face of somebody
else As you step up she has her arms crossed in
front of her cocks her head to the side and looks
to you specifically and goes 
Well hello Captain You have returned from
your journey Jawgrasp
 Successful Well wondrous Please give me
the item requested

 Who are you
 Captain it would appear to me that you
have brought The Mist all this way across our
specific route through the reef with a crew that I
have not met please introduce me
 This surprises me not at all

 She nods along with a very confused look on
her face
 Cornelius Very well I look forward to
seeing what you are capable of cooking up Cornelius
 This one
 Shes adorable
 What about this little runt you brought
on
 She turns back to you and begins to walk a
circle around you arms behind her back now
Folded Jawgrasp so you come to me with a new
crew and you tell me that you are successful but
yet you are not Describe to me what transpired to
prevent you from acquiring this thing you have paid for
 How did this terrible terrible thing
happen to you She reaches up and touches the
side of your neck
 Her hand passes through
 the illusion and she steps back and
goes

 I must commend you it has been a very long
time since someone has been so bold with such
massive balls to come onto my ship And I think
that perhaps I got where I am today not by seeing
through a few paltry illusions
 You drop the the Disguise Self okay As you
say that and the Disguise Self drops you hear a
series of sounds that you hadnt really heard in
succession before 

 As you see most of the crew now wielding
some variation of the firearms you had seen both
in Hupperdook or the traveling armies of the
Empire eastward towards the boundaries of Xhorhas

 Have them trained on the lot of you The
captain still now has her hands crossed in front
of you and goes Well I guess now that we are
out in the open who the fuck are you and how did
you come in the possession of The Mist
 But there are only seven of you

 So you are the captain of that ship Are
you suggesting that we parlay

 Very well Well since youve been so
forthright Tracy Phillip Sapphire Cornelius
Janet and Gilligone
 Welcome aboard the Squalleater I am
Captain Avantika Now the fact that you are here
that youve made your way across the reef that
you managed to best our sister ship and the crew
on board which I assume have all been
dispatched
 You do you do

 Its noticeably lower In maybe a short ten
minute period itll be finding its way onto the beach
 Yeah
 Make a Perception check
 You look around real fast and you see a few
birds are perched up in the sails but you dont
know which ones Frumpkin if Frumpkins up there
One of them does look small might be him
 Right now you look up and you can see
through Frumpkins vision down on the deck
Frumpkin has a view from above and is present The
captain continues Well then my next question
is what are you planning here Why have you gone
to all this trouble to kill my crew to bring the
ship right back to me and then to be perfectly
honest prostrate yourself before us
 Troubles
 Do you know the purpose of this item
 She looks at you with an eye that has tore
through a thousand lies and gives a surprising
smile of acknowledgement Interesting Well
youve proven that you are talented at least to
have survived this far But Im a bigger fan of
loyalty Talent and loyalty well that is
obviously my birthday As it stands The Mighty
Nein there are two paths you can walk You one
could live under the crew and proves yourselves as
both skilled and as trustworthy as I hope you may
be if our goals are indeed aligned Perhaps even
join us if the deeds please me Or two we weigh
your corpses down with rocks and leave you here
amongst the reef
 Im afraid so little Sapphire
 Captain what was your actual name
 Captain Fjord Whatll it be
 Well stick with Fjord
 At the moment you say this you feel this
cold sensation in the back of your skull as one of
the cocked rifles is now pressed up against the
base of the head
 You have a no idea
 She goes There is no negotiation Im
sorry but the choice you make now that is
 Well based on the fact that you brought
yourselves this far to tell me that you have it I
would assume that its somewhere either on your
ship across the way that I currently am in
possession of or its on your person so we could
rummage through your bodies to find it afterwards

 Im afraid Im not as involved in the arts
as some perhaps She puts her hand up and raises
her fingers twice and you feel the pressure of
the barrel back off and all the guns eventually
they stay trained on you but they pull back a bit
and go lax a little bit Do you agree
 Well then Mighty Nein welcome to the
Squalleater  All the guns pull back a
bit Everyone stays present and theyre keeping
an eye on you As much as this agreement has
happened theres still a sense of careful
watchfulness from the crew but Avantika seems to
drop that intensity and reaches forward a hand to
shake yours
 If youre hungry there are plenty of
fruits that have dropped from the trees on the
island First order of business some of my men
are going to work to begin repairing my other
ship In the meantime you relax bring your
things aboard I would like to question some of
you about what you know
 As the captain turns to the older woman who
accompanied you and goes Vera Let me introduce
you to your charges for the evening
 The captain I will return in just a little
bit but in the meantime Vera can answer your
questions Dont do anything stupid
 Good The captain steps down into her
quarters and Vera approaches and looks you all
over with a very intense glare All right so
Welcome Are you hungry
 With me She turns around and begins to
leave You begin to see in the distance another
boat One of the boats that you guys had taken to
the ship has made its way in the direction of The
Mistake What would you like to do while youre
here on the ship
 Theyre still watching you Youre still on
the deck but you have some time to discuss or
anything you want to do
 At the moment nothing
 Yep
 Within a short time of you guys having this
conversation Vera returns to the deck of the ship
and goes The captain would like you to please
join her in the quarters below please
 Sure
 You guys follow Vera down below to the dark
and it takes a second for your eyes to adjust
going from the bright daylight to the darker
quarters in the deck below but youre led to the
captains quarters this beautiful open room with
a mismatched patchwork of old carpets that have
all been laid over each other from various designs
from around Exandria Theres a desk that has a
bunch of carve marks into it theres some papers
laid out and there you can see Avantika sitting
with her legs up on the desk currently eating on
some sort of a tropical fruit watching you all
enter with a bit of a grin on her face Please
fill the space
 Make a perception check
 Yes actually on the right side of the room
there is a small pack of freshly collected
tropical fruits theres some nuts a cheese
thats been designed for longer travel and will
keep well By all means please
 The doors close behind you but before the
doors close all the rest of the crew that were
armed are essentially right nearby waiting to
storm in at any given point in time
 Right outside the door
 Its just you and the captain from what you
can tell Its just you guys
 You see a couple of windows and a doorway
behind her that leads to a balcony that looks out
the back of the ship
 You see a couple of papers Actually you
see a familiarlooking map
 Akin to what you guys were supposed to have
last week but the mail service decided not to
have it We have the map of the Menagerie Coast
and another map that has a similar layout to what
you found mostly burned in The Mist As well as a
few other pieces of paper that appear to be tucked
away into portions of the desk
 Make an investigation check Actually this
would be a perception check Its just a glance
but its going to be a higher DC Investigation
youd have to actually physically rummage through
the room so make a perception check
 Both of you make a perception check
 You rolled balls
 Going to get you a d that instead of a
one it has a pair of balls Right there yeah An
eight The room looks pretty solidly made and the
floorboard while there are scuffs to it theres
nothing that gives you the idea that there would
be any hidden compartment or any sort of small
cubby that would be out of view Whatd you get
 You do see two books that are laying on the
shelf to your left amongst a set of candles
Theres a small lantern You see a set of
navigation tools that are barely poking out of a
small wooden box Yeah there are two books there
You cant quite see the binder or if there is
anything written on the sides Its pretty
plainbound Anyways the doors closed The
captain looks to you and goes All right so now
that youve agreed to become our friend I would
like to see the first test of you proving your
loyalty You have this item I require You have it
here Where is it
  Little goblin girl trust me I
have a decent idea of what Im doing
 Make a deception check
 She goes nein Oh my goodness that
sounds terrible Well obviously we cannot have
you touching it then
 Please cut through the bullshit for me
please Captain Fjord
 Will you tell me if I call you Tusktooth
 Then Captain Tusktooth please tell me

 Respectfully youre not in a position
once again to negotiate You tell me and Ill
tell you a little back and forth Honestly the
one who has to prove their loyalty right now is
not myself
 I wonder how it found its way there Make
a deception check
 You know precisely where it lies in the
reef
 Show me and she pushes forward the map
the same similar map to what you were given You
have it with you
 So you stole my ship and came all this way
to tell me that this item was not in your
possession and is another place Why were you
coming to the island Im very confused
 Well first off Marius LePual is merely
a bullshit messenger but Im glad at least he
could bring you to us Is that all you know about
the actual sphere
 Shes looking right into you lids
halfclosed this dagger stare of trying to read
any sort of give
 Very well lets trade a bit The object I
have not seen before but I know of it and am
hoping to bring it to this island for a purpose I
had recently hired an individual known as Jamedi
Cosko a very wellestablished adventurer delver
of dungeons Cosko is a Not Costco

 COSKO Cosko
 To spend a few days across the jungles of
the island to see what there is to be found there
You see this object this sphere it needs to
return There is a temple in there that is from
long ago and has been since refitted by its
current denizens Something at the very bottom of
that temple requires to be reunioned reunited
with this thing I seek So
 Does the name Ukotoa mean anything to
you
 She throws a quick dagger in the direction
of Caleb that drags the cheese from his hand and
sticks to the wall
 Apparently

 You were
 Ukotoa Spelled UK apostrophe OTOA
Ukotoa the great leviathan
 The great leviathan
 Her eyes are trained on Fjord as she says
this Well you see I am the chosen of Ukotoa
She pulls the scarf down from under her neck and
in the sternum there is a tattoo of an eye


 You see this great serpent once ruled the
Lucidian Ocean
 Your reactions are killing me Travis
Shortly after the Calamity washed this land clean
and Zehir the Cloaked Serpent god was banished
long away one of his greatest creations was left
 The indigenous people of this series of
islands the Swavain Islands called the KiNau
were granted the blessing of Ukotoa
 Nothing and no one could stand before them
However the surviving worshipers of this
oncepowerful god now banished grew jealous and
sealed him beneath the rocky depths of the ocean
defaced the temples built in their name I will
bring him back and with their blessing these
seas will be mine Let me tell you youve put in
with the proper lot
 She puts the scarf back up to hide the
tattoo So Ive shown you mine You show me yours

 She doesnt flinch
 Which puts your head pretty much right into
the top
 I love this color palette
 Back to Fjord
 Yes Make a performance check
 You can tell the captains Yes but is
also peeking out of the corner of her eye at this
strange display
 You dont know if shes heard it but you
guys are in a very enclosed space and she sees you
all deliberating about something that youre all
deciding whether or not to reveal Shes not like
Oh everythings fine She knows somethings up
and shes waiting for someone to come out with it
 Yes
 Well Im not certain but Im the one who
has the dreams
 This big smile curls across her face and
you watch her go a little flushed She goes What
kind of dreams
 She looks a little confused but says No
Unlike some I can hold my brine
 Her smile grows wider So Ukotoa has
spoken to you as well

 Perhaps it was not some strange coincidence
you found your way here then Fjord
 All right
 Avantika is its almost a palpable passion
behind her The excitement and adrenaline is
pumping through her body and you can see her now
leaning forward in her seat Her feet are off the
desk and her hands are grasping the sides of it in
her gloves Shes looking across most of you but
focused on Fjord and says Well Im very
curious to see where this leads as well Then
perhaps let us stay the night onboard Lets wait
for Jamedi to return if hes plotted out the
course to this temple
 Jamedi Cosko
 If this is indeed the kismet you speak of
what better way to prove your loyalty to me and my
ship than to be the ones to go into this temple
with me
 She looks around to the rest of you claps
her hands twice The door opens behind and Vera
enters Captain you summoned She looks about
to the rest of you in the chamber and turns to her
and goes Please clear out some quarters for our
guests Tell Zoen and Waldok to sleep on the deck
tonight Give them comfortable rooms and bedding
Please keep a close eye for Jamedi Any day now
I can feel it We are very close
 Thats Cosko yes
 Somewhere the spirit of Purvan sits next to
Vaxildan looking down and going Come on Vera
nods and looks a bit curious Well then follow
me Ill lead you to your chambers as the captain
wishes She looks confused and taken aback by
this sudden burst of generosity What are you guys
doing Do you follow
 There you go
 Make a perception check
 You dont see any indication of the temple
or anything but you see now above the door as
youre exiting there is a small shelf You can
see a tiny little black iron shrine that looks to
be an ouroboros serpent thats eating its own
tail About every inch or so theres an eye
across the length of its body In the center of it
you see a single metal sphere with a similar
cloven line down the center of it
 Below deck a lot of them have put the
rifles away and they have their hands on the side
of their various cutlasses and longswords and
shortswords
 Roll an intelligence check You can
definitely instantly with your feat the DMs bane feat
 You get a quick glance at it From a
superficial level you have a good idea of how it
looks Youre not entirely certain of the
components required
 You see about three of them are longer
barrels Theyre a twohanded piece There are a
handful that are a simple Laura Bailey ladies
and gentlemen
 A few of them that have some sort of a
flintlock One of them has a multibarrel spinning piece
 Familiar to some
 Is there anything else you guys wish to do
as youre being led to the chambers
 No As you walk and you are led Vera tells
two of the various deckhands to grab their shit
and leave for the night They confusedly do so and
look a bit put out by it but you guys are led to
these two chambers that are more comfortable than
at least the area you slept in The Mistake
 That would be down in the cargo hold which
youve not been led to You guys are currently on
the main upper decks now Youre led to your
chambers There are still guards posted on the
outside There isnt a complete trust in this
regard but its not having weapons trained on you
the entirety of your stay now at least
 You didnt pay a very close attention to it
but you can go and check if youd like
 Sure You head up to it and the flag
actually is an exact or is close to a replica of
the tattoo that she has on her sternum
 Both
 They have blades sheathed for close combat
You know when youre below deck generally you
want shorter blades and things that are good for
close quarters The firearms are more for if they
have to do something at a distance
 Youve seen at least seven or eight of the
crew with some form of firearm Their make from a
quick glance you saw a lot of their make and
construction varies They seem to have been
plucked from different sources
 Its funny you ask that question
 No youre in your chamber Youre alone
but you dont know how thick these walls are You
know there are people stationed right outside of
your door
 Make an investigation check
 You take a moment to glance around the space
and feel along the walls You dont notice
anything that catches your attention
 Let me check I do not believe it is
 But I will check real fast while Im here
 It prevents creatures from entering and
exiting outside of the ones that you choose but
it does not shift alter or stop any sound
passage
 Sure
 Right okay Ill allow it
 Yeah sure
 Make a medicine check
 Having a fair understanding of the halforc
body while Fjord is generally a little more lithe
and trimmer than most more burly half orcs still
a decent build but you dont feel any particular
strange lumps
 You dont feel anything unfortunately
 Its like late afternoon It isnt quite
dusk yet but whenever you want to Essentially
youre ready and prepared for an evenings rest
well go do that
 You go ahead and find yourselves settling in
best you can for the evenings rest As
 Make a stealth check
 With your cloak yes
 Im not even going to roll
 All right for one thing as soon as you
because theres only one exit to the chamber
 Theres only one exit to the chamber The
door that leads out as soon as you door
creaking you see the guard is posted right there
You feel pretty quiet and youre pretty you feel
that youre in the groove where you can get
through pretty quickly without being seen but you
have to get past that one guard that you can see
stationed right outside of the door
 Ill say because of your stealth check yes
You very carefully nudge the door open enough to
get like an inch of viewing space between That
both reveals the guard and the hallway further down
 Okay
 Keeping a tally
 You create the image of him walking back and
forth The guard notices  Pats
another guard that you dont see on the upper side
of the door Guards like Is Cosko back Go get
the captain The other guy goes and walks away
and the other guy stands there nervously looking
back and forth Jamedi
 Jamedi Jamedi He goes and starts walking
in that direction
 Okay you get by you get outside of the
door Are you running to the right or the left
 You run to the left You go running down the
hallway and youre now not that far behind the
other guard who was rushing off and heading up a
small set of stairs that leads up to the captains
quarters You remember this before Youre
actually heading away from the cargo hold this way
now Youre heading up
 Yeah
 Okay you go the other direction and the
guy whos now walked up towards Cosko towards
Jamedi is now rushing up to it and goes and is
talking to him like Sir hello
 Make a perception check
 Youre not sure you see a couple of chairs
a card table thats currently empty You can see
the hallway continues past where this illusion is
happening
 As he does so the guys like Jamedi the
captain will be right here What Just looks
really confused
 Your stealth check yes there is You dart
past
 Right at that moment you look over your
shoulder and you can see the captain is now
heading down the hallway in your direction
 He goes What I dont
 You run to the end of the hallway You see
those stairs ascending down into the cargo hold
below and you hear over your shoulder And where
is he No but Captain he was right Look at
the cards
 You hear the argument and the guy
desperately trying to explain what he just saw as
you disappear down into the cargo hold below
 On the way down the stairs there is another
floor that is the gun deck that you do pass by
and you can see the back end of these large
cannons that are all situated Theyre all angled
up a little bit but there are these doors that
lead outward There are a number of cannon balls
and some bits of black powder in small barrels
set up in that region If you can continue down to the
 You head down to the cargo hold and you see
one source of lantern light There is one of the
various deckhands is down below keeping watch
Has a single oil lantern on a crate It is this
small handheld jug of some sort of you assume a
liquor and hes sipping from it Leaning back and
stretching Just keeping an eye out
 Currently yeah
 Easy enough to do  Goes dark
What
 Okay so you start making your way around
As you do you start seeing sparks Of a flint
 Hes trying to relight the lantern Hes
like Ooh fucking shit stupid little lantern
Make an investigation check if you wanted to look
into the cargo hold
 How thorough do you want this search to be
Because itll take you a while to go through the
entire cargo hold
 Okay youll probably have to snuff the
lantern one more time and really frustrate the
hell out of him
 The flint
 Yeah
 Okay all right He lights the lantern
holds it up and you knock it out of his hand
 Hold on a second I got to make a roll
here
 Theres a lot of gunpowder on this ship
 Yeah youre fine
 The lantern hits the ground and tips over
and a little bit of oil spills out but it doesnt
like scatter and ignite Hes like Shit and he
quickly goes and picks it back up again While
youre investigating the first couple crates you
can get to without making any sort of noise that
gets his attention you can tell you lift up the
top ones The first one you come to is filled with hardtack
 The second one you come to a smell gets
your attention immediately and you lift it up
and it does have a similar smell to that gunpowder
type material that you encountered on that pistol
 You see small kegs that are currently closed
off
 Okay its about that big
 Youre going to pull it out you got one
 Okay hes now picked up the lantern again
because youve looked through two crates now
 Hes clutching that lantern with a death
grip now and is now scanning the room and
suddenly his pants  to the ground Hes
like Whoa shit and hes reaching down with
the other hand trying to pull it up and hes got
like the lantern in one hand his hand on the
outside of the pants in the other Hes tripping a
bit and bumps into one of the crates You manage
to get to a third crate You open it up and look
inside and it looks like its a bunch of coiled
rope Its a lot of repair materials for the ship
Theres a thick tarlike substance Its probably
used for some form of repairs
 Okay he gets his pants up
 Hes now in the process of walking through
the room Is there anything else youre going to do
 Make a dexterity check
 Yes Something youre good at
 Okay It   the small
shatter The guys like Who goes there
 He goes walking in that direction You
get one final crate that you get to You pull it
open Looking inside it looks to be Im sorry
there isnt a whole lot more to find but most of
the cargo here is food You find a lot of an older
set of fruit maybe various things that were
brought from their last destination The smell
immediately hits you of like fermenting orange
and other types of various sweet or at least now
sweet and fermented fruit
 Okay You quickly fill your pockets Its
squishy to the touch When they put it in there
it  on the inside You feel it the cold
wetness of it spilling against your shirt You
get some pockets filled with fermented fruit
 Yep
 Yeah
 You make your way back
 Okay make another stealth check
 Yep
 Thats money well spent for you guys Thank
Mr Pumat Sol for getting you that ability
 You make your way back While this is
happening you guys can hear the argument outside
from the other guards and the captain lambasting
them for pulling her out of her quarters for
telling ghost stories and getting her excited
that Jamedi had returned when he actually hasnt
Then they go quiet you hear the footsteps come by
your room and the door opens The captain looks
inside and goes Captain Fjord care to join
me

 Right this way She walks and heads
towards her quarters
 Yep You follow her
 As you follow the captain quickly behind
Nott you make your way into the chamber
 Close the door behind you
 There you go While thats happening Fjord
you make your way to the captains quarters

ComicCon to go to Artist Alley with a stack of
two dollar bills So I did I got this wonderful
piece of original art of Alexander Hamilton
down and realized that I was buying him in Jeffersons
may or not have remembered to put that picture in
but I think I took a side by side just to mark
the moment I dont know who would have been more
happy or angry about but I think Hamilton wins
 Oh thats amazing

Sundry we like to play a lot of RPGs Ive been
lucky enough to run a few myself like Doctor Who
on TBD RPG Star Trek on Shield of Tomorrow and
of course now Callisto  We thought it was time
for us to sit down with some of our players and
discuss their characters and the choices they made
on a very special one night only covering Callisto
join us for a night of fun insights and emotional
backstories the way only GS can do it I got to
be honest this feels like the laziness thing
weve ever done you know gag wise Would you
agree with that


Impact in  seconds

 Yeah
 I saw Travis Willingham over the weekend

 He saw it and hes like Whoa dude nice
jacket I was like Thank you Travis and he
was like Man where did you get a jacket that
because were both roughly the same size Hes
just seven times more yoked than I could ever be
So I let him try on the jacket and it fit him
better than it fit me
 Give me the jacket back

TALIESIN You earned that jacket
 Give me my jacket back

Riegel its Momlan

having a good time
many great Critters in your home of New York
the cast
Welcome back the cast of Critical Role

part over here

Momlan told me backstage that you have a question
that youve always wanted to ask Matt Mercer since
youve been watching the show
 Yes

 Only because its you
  Its high noon
welcome Take a bow
 That was the Momlan free pass Enjoy it
while you can
 I believe were back
 Look at this
 Look at this theater of beautiful faces
This is absolutely surreal

 You guys are amazing I love you too

But it is not the time for loving Well

 It is the time for Dungeons  Dragons

 Picking up where we left off Fjord
 You walk into the Captains chambers
 Closing the door behind you its dark lit
the back door is open to the balcony out there
and you can hear the waves crash against the ship
There are a few candles lit in the room where they
were before
 The captain is standing in the doorway and
looking out over the ocean and as soon as the
door closes behind turns around and goes I
would like to talk with you about how youve been
reached out to how you are touched by
 This magnificent entity Ukotoa Theres
been a very long time since Ive met anyone else
chosen so please tell me how this happened
 Yeah
 Yep Frumpkin is still up on the deck
 Frumpkin goes and perches on the outer
balcony of the Squalleater
 She leans her shoulder against the doorway
looking over at your eyes distantly reaching for
memories and goes There has been one other
Its been many years This came to me through a
series of unexpected You see her searching for
the right words and says Ive always considered
myself a very lucky person At first I thought
this was a terrible portent when this beautiful
Ukotoa spoke to me It was a purpose that nobody
else in Darktow was going on and with that I
began to gather my crew It took a while but each
of them began to believe as well All of them
support and when this is done the blessing is
high Nay he is unstoppable behind me as
I am on the sea
 They have now yes Ive read the books
Ive looked up about the KiNau Ive learned of
the history As they once were the masters of the
Lucidian Ocean so too will be I So too can be us
 They say that Ukotoa is an infinite length
entity a serpent that entwines the entirety of
the water That is but eyes across its body to see
what else it must conquer
 Beautiful
 Make a persuasion check
 She tugs down the scarf to reveal the tattoo
without breaking eye contact and goes Ill do
you one better

 Removes the glove off of her right hand and
in the palm you see a familiar yellow eye emerging
from the center This is the blessing It leaves
the first stage I have been chosen to be one step
to his unsealing
 Make a perception check
 You hope its a tattoo but the way the
candle light hits it looks smooth and somewhat glassy
 With a flash and a scattering of ocean water
across the far wall of the chamber the falchion
emerges in your grasp

 Its what its always done

 She immediately takes a step forward like
holding her palm forward still Not even looking
at you just looking at the sword and specifically
focusing on the eye in the center of the hilt
Shes speechless for a moment you hear her
breathe in suddenly Perhaps it was destiny
 Ive only heard As far as I know when
these survivors of Zehir this long sealed god
grew jealous that they are the ones who put
Ukotoa away below the ocean
 If Im correct and this is one of the
original temples then I think we can bring him back
 This is but one there are three I know
of
 Three temples across the Swavain islands
 I dont know if theres a name for it I
just call it the sphere The eye
 Ill be honest the dreams that I have
its mostly just feeling and an occasional word
like hes being held back I feel that if we can
one by one release him from these bindings he
can be more direct with us Be more direct with
his blessing He will bequeath the sea unto us
 Tells me to to watch to learn
 To consume

 She steps around the desk
 Just places her fingers on the hilt of the
sword where the eye is Then youll need your rest
 Thank you for your honesty eventually

 Understood Anyway and she pulls her hand
away Go and may sweet dreams find you

 At this point the door opens and Fjord
returns to the room
 Question Caleb
 Right
 Make a perception check
 Okay You watch as she takes her glove and
puts it back on looking at her palm as she does
Looks out over the ocean and steps out to the
railing where she has to move away to get out of
the visual perspective and spends a minute or so
looking over the water Then turns back goes and
closes the door walks over to underneath the main
doorway where that shrine is She pulls a stool
up to stand up to about eye level to where the
shrine is Then she pulls her glove off once more
makes a small cut on her finger and drops a few
pieces of blood onto the small iron shrine Its
maybe about that big and then puts the glove back
on mumbles a few words beneath her breath though
Frumpkin might not able to see from this
perspective Then goes ahead and snuffs the candles
 With that perception roll Id say you dont
know
 I dont know man Not for me Im real bad
at seeing that
 To you I would say no not in the time that
you saw it
 You guys all get yourselves to sleep
 Okay as you guys all find yourself to rest
Is your mic not working
 You share with Taliesin
 Well share thats fine So as you all go
to sleep finding yourself into an evening of rest Fjord
 You dont need to That was more helpful
earlier in the campaign when everything was a
super mystery You spilled all the beans recently
so its fine You walk in darkness your eyes
trained on a barely visible horizon of faded blue
The lightless midnight horizon that breaks this
endless void The ground is soft beneath your feet
and your slow gait bounces slightly with each
step Like time is crawling in this buoyant space
You look down at yourself obscured by a shadow
until a faint yellow light bursts from your sword
The light of a yellow eye now open from the hilt
like a lantern lighting a tangled forest of kelp
before you Bubbles escape the corner of your
mouth but you breath the waters calmly like a
thick vapor Learn You search through the mass
of shifting slick sea vines eventually coming upon
the base of a staircase going up Grow
What do you do
 As you ascend the cold stone stairs the
beam of the eye lighting the way your passage is
suddenly blocked by something A statue humanoid
but featureless Provoke
 The statue breaks apart its various shards
emerging from the detonation and slowly sinking in
what is now the thick waters around you As the
head tumbles past the light of the edge of your
Sabian You push beyond continuing to ascend the
stairs You come upon another statue larger and
looming more than the last What do you do
 As the darkened energy arcs from the hilt of
your blade hitting it you watch as the cracks
spider up the stone before it detonates into
hundreds of shards of dark stone You see half of
the face slowly hit and clatter onto the stone
before falling off to the side Vandren Do you
continue up
 Looking down the statue itself is now
immaterial Youve entirely annihilated it and you
glance over the side and what few shards still
remain slowly drift beyond your view into the
dark abyss below
 Continuing to ascend these steps one by one
they grow more and more narrow You think you see
an approaching surface of some kind Youre clear
of the water suddenly breaking the surface and
youre standing in a dark stone chamber Youve
managed to get all the way up standing within the
ankle high water in the middle of the stone
chamber and you watch as all the liquid begins to
drain Until theres no more water around you
Revealing in the center of this chamber an
intricate circle in the ground maybe two feet
across Beautiful ancient craftsmanship detailed
to depict a serpent body coiled Carved eyes
emerging from the creatures body every few
inches The center of the water is a circle of
water like a well Watching What do you do
 As you hold the blade up you see the light
hits the water and is absorbed by it You dont
see anything beneath it It seems to be just a
void that eats the light
 You step into it
 Well is that what you want to do
 Okay you step into the circle its only a
few inches deep of water and your feet feel the
bottom It is shallow Youre now standing above
it its only about two feet across so its
basically you standing over the small pool
 Looking around you you can see stone walls
and you could see a ceiling above you It is
almost plain featureless room aside from the very
edges of stone stacked upon itself
 You look towards the hilt and the eye stares
back at you The light temporarily blinding you
for a moment as you adjust
 You press the blade in through the water and
it hits the stone
 No response Then you hear once more
Watch
 Make a perception check
 The handle of the sword is somewhat slick in
your grasp from the water youve been traveling
from before and you feel the blade almost trying
to turn in your grasp turning the eye away from you
 It slowly finds its way resting facing down
towards the pool
 You place your face down into the water and
as opposed to the stone surface youve seen there
it is this vacuous black void There you see in a
sudden instant the eye opens up before you the
bright yellow light enveloping you Suddenly
theres searing heat and you pull back out of the
pool and the entire chamber is filled with blazing
hot steam It hurts at first but then it begins
to feel nice This burning sensation crawling
across your body going instead from pain to a
surge of strength Of control of purpose The
voice again says Reward As you look up around
you the stone falls away and on the distance you
can see that horizon once more Now an endless
ocean You can see the faint ripples of waves
across a sourceless bit of moonlight There you
see dozens of ships coming towards you What do
you do
 You turn behind you and it is just darkness
Inky infinite
 Make a perception check
 No
 As you concentrate looking towards the
right of you where it looks like four or five
vessels are in a localized portion of this black
endless ocean As you concentrate you see the
water begin to boil beneath them
 You watch as the ocean fires up like a
spire a pillar of solid ocean water The ships
are scattered in different directions as it slams
them down once more scattering them into
thousands of pieces of splintered wood
 The center of the ocean parts giving this
slight vacuum This dualsided abyssal crevice in
the center of the ocean On the opposite ends of
where your hands rise you watch the waves rise up
and in one fell sweep two solid crystalline walls
of water slam together and then even out As the
ripples subside all you can see are the thousands
and thousands of glittering shards of what once
were that armada
 Reward And you wake up

 Its somehow worse with that outfit
 As the rest of you come to consciousness in
the morning Fjord seems to be sleeping in a
little bit before suddenly shooting up with a
gasp
 Make an insight check Make a deception
check
 I mean he seems perturbed by something but
you dont disbelieve him Caduceus however

 Fair enough Oh but looking at passive
insight for Beauregard and Caleb
 You guys head your way up to the deck
 All right

 Okay you guys have made it to the deck
Its early morning The suns only really been up
maybe an hour or so Theres still a mist across
the ocean and you can see the distance where the
reefs encapsulate the surrounding area of this
island The mist is so heavy that you cannot see
beyond other than a few other signs that you
recall when you first passed through that reef
Looking off the way of the shore you can see that
The Mistake is currently grounded and looks like
theres a small crew trying to do repairs Youre
not quite sure to what extent and how long itll
take but the ship seems to be at least the time
being out of commission
 You can see Vera Captain Avantika and a few
of the crew members are currently in a
conversation with a man that you hadnt seen
before You see a gentleman completely bald head
very dark brown skin A heavy leather coat with
like a few belts or bandoliers attached to it He
has a satchel on the side and a few blades that
are sheathed and hanging He looks like an
individual whos ready to travel In case anything
happens hes prepared Maybe a little cleaner
than Caleb but definitely a little ramshackle in
appearance Theyre in the middle of a
conversation and as soon as you approach the deck
the Captain notices your presence and goes Good
morning Come it seems that our destined journey
is just around the corner Please The Mighty
Nein may I introduce you to a good friend who is
hoping to be arrived soon Jamedi Jamedi this is
The Mighty Nein He turns to you all and goes It
is a pleasure to meet you all The Captain has
told me that we are to be traveling to the island
together yes
 I will tell you it is very dangerous Bring
what you think is necessary The island itself is
indeed cursed for the creatures that call it
home
 I was about to give you that before you so
rudely interrupted me first thing in the morning
 He gives like a look to the Captain the
Captains like There are a number of lizard folk
that patrol the outskirts of the island calling it
home hunting I could not quite suss out the
source of where their society is but they seem to
live on the exterior of the island Further in I
did find the temple but it is not abandoned
There are villages of snake men that surround this
stone shrine Their mutations are various and
strange I managed to avoid being seen and I made
it to the initial interior chambers of this
village of this stone obelisk of a temple but I
surmised it would be best if I went further with
aid of those who were capable of defending
themselves So I came back I do have a path that
I think is of how you say least resistance so I
would say bring what is important to perhaps deal
with lizards and snakes
 Yes
 No
 There were various of both sexes and perhaps
between I do not know the full idea of these
creatures physiology
 I did not look too closely into the
 I would not suggest trying to kill them
all Trying to avoid them expediency using the
shadows and travel without being found I think is
our best bet at survival
 The Captain goes What is a dodecahedron
 The Captain claps her hands twice again to
get everyones attention Vera look after the
ship Look after our men their men Jamedi lead
the way I am excited to see what we uncover
together huh
 I hope you slept well Come To the boats
The rope ladders are let over once more You all
descend into these row boats Between the two of
them most of you can get onto it a little
awkwardly but enough to at least make your way
the few hundred feet to the shore You eventually
come upon the beautiful white beaches of Urukaxl
You see the occasional shard of driftwood or a
glimmer of a smooth abalone shell scattered
amongst the sandy beach The jungle line begins
about  feet before you and immediately grows
dense and tangled with vines root and various
jungle tropical trees that choke the sky above
Jamedi turns to the rest of you and goes Now you
must be quiet Move quickly as the island has
many denizens that would find us exotic meats Are
we ready
 Then come He begins to lead the way in
and Captain Avantika looks to us This will be
fun yeah
 As you all slowly begin to duck in towards
the tree line of the jungle well pick up there
next week

 That was fun
 Thank you guys all so much for coming and

City

and is it Thursday yet Good night

 Step around Were doing this Thank you
guys This is so fucking surreal Oh is it still
on My mics still on oops

 And welcome back
 No never Last we left off
 The Mighty
Nein following their thread of information in
pursuit of the source of the strange sphere that
Fjord had come into the possession of that
seemed to tie in some way shape or form to the
magical powers he had been slowly learning to
control and manifest led you to southward to the
Menagerie Coast where you commandeered a ship
named the Mist which you then renamed the
Mistake hired a crew and made your way
southsoutheast towards the island of Urukaxl to
follow the apparent source of this note that
seemed to have some information about where it was
from and where it may go Upon approaching you
were greeted by a much larger ship which had shot
a warning shot across the bow and demanded you to
come meet the captain on their deck You there met
Captain Avantika who had given you the options of
either proving yourselves beneath her and her crew
by helping them putting yourself in danger at her
behest or they would weigh your corpses down with
rocks within the nearby bay amongst the reefs You
agreed to give into these demands and an evenings
stay within the ship known as the Squalleater A
little bit of thievery went into the cargo hold of
the ship while Fjord had been called to the
captains quarters where the two of you
discovered that you had something in common You
both appeared to have been from her words the
chosen of Ukotoa an ancient entity referred to
as the leviathan that was a historical creation of
Zehir the Cloaked Serpent before it was banished
along with the rest of the gods in the Calamity
and following Divergence Now the captain seeing
herself as the chosen and seeing you in a similar
state  this kismet was grappled onto quite
strongly by her sent you to bed with the
excitement of this travel of which you would
embark upon in the next day
 Upon waking you found that Jamedi a hired
adventurer and dungeoneer who was set out to scope
the island and find this temple this supposed
structure that was built in honor of Ukotoa long
ago and had since been retaken by followers of the
Cloaked Serpent Jamedi returned finding the rest
of the path too dangerous but had managed to
locate the whereabouts of this temple Now youve
gathered your things you left the Squalleater
onto a couple of skiffs rowed yourself onto the
white beach shores of Urukaxl and as you all step
across the long beach towards the line of trees
that makes the jungle you make your way into this
mysterious wooded area Mighty Nein welcome to
the jungle
  Youre gonna die  As
Jamedi begins pushing forward into this I would
like to one have a marching order
 I mean you guys are going into dangerous
territory
 Fjords up front
 Avantikas going to ride up with Fjord
 Jamedis going to be scouting a little bit
ahead Nott where are you
 Yasha will hold up the rear from a defensive
standpoint Caduceus Caleb
 Okay
 You are very much in tropical weather It is
warm it is humid and even within maybe ten
minutes of walking into the jungle you can feel
the sweat beginning to gather at the edges of your
hair and the back of your coat
 So youre leaving the coat behind
 Ok gotcha Cool
 You begin to step through the soft floor of
the island jungle each footstep coming with a
sort of spongy pressure before it hits hard earth
rock or just compressed compost and soft
vegetation I need you all to roll a stealth check
as a group as you press forward
 Of course
 Avantika and Jamedi Got it All right
Caduceus
 Good
 foot radius right
 Ill roll for Yasha as well Natural  all
right You guys ever so quietly disappear into the
jungle brush without issue The hanging vines and
heavy palm fronds around you heavily obscuring
your procession deeper into this
 Continuing onward Whos keeping watch on
this
 Jamedi
 All right Go ahead and roll perception for your
vicinity You guys are rolling perception for the
path ahead of you
 So anyway
Bring it in Pushing forward you look ahead and
its just endless trees and hanging vines and
heavy roots in the ground You feel nice and
confident in the fact that nothing is catching
your attention A hand touches your shoulder and
turns you to the right Its Jamedi who goes
Shh Look at this here This was the first on
my He pulls a small piece of paper and is
taking notes I have not looked further within
but this was the first marker to our entry
inside As he points over to show you about a
hundred or so feet off partially obscured by one
of the nearby heavy fronds a dilapidated
driftwood shack with a frondthatched roof He
looks back to the rest of you as you begin to
approach This is the first marker Do you have a
need to stop or do we press on
 Ive walked through but did not stop
I do not know if it is safe or not
 Okay Jamedi begins to move
and Avantika puts her hand out and stops Jamedi
and goes Terribly sorry but you are more
important on this You two you can do this
without him
 Very well We await your return
 The two of you tread on As you approach 
you get a good look at it It looks like this hut has been
untouched in a long while A lot of the overgrowth
in the jungle has reclaimed the base of the wood
A lot of it appears to be driftwood or ramshackle
planks that have been carved from trees that have
fallen over in the vicinity or possibly scavenged
from shipwrecks that have washed ashore It is a
mismatch of different types of wood and cobbled
materials but it is a shack Its probably no
more than tenfoot by tenfoot its not extremely
large You do see a halfrotted sheet of some sort
of thick material that blocks the doorway You see
some holes that have been eaten through it
 Okay You get to the curtain and
the material is a thick you can see that it
probably once belonged to a sail or of a heavy
tarp thats long rotted and mildewed and as you
put your hand to it and tug on it elements of the
threads separate a little bit Peering inside you
see its mostly empty Theres a simple cot
theres a chair a mildewed leather coat that
appears to be half folded over and thrown in the
corner and a small box up on the far end of the
table in the room thats just open theres no lid
to it The whole room smells faintly of rot
 Shh
 You can make an investigation check
if you want to go check the interior
 Okay Make a perception check
 Yep
 Glancing around the space you see half of
your party hiding mostly not too far off maybe
a hundred feet from the edge Looking around you
you notice there are a few animals that are up in
the top of the trees leaping Looks to be some
sort of monkeytype creature small leaping from
branch to branch You see a few colorful jungle
birds that are up in the higher elements of the
tree tops At the moment no noticeable dangerous
figures that could be lurking nearby
 Yeah
 Looking about touching the floor you dont
notice any trap doors You find one plank that
feels loose You pull it up and its just dirt
Yeah its just the table the cot the open box
 Okay You pull the box off the shelf and
pull it over It has a bunch of old dryrotted
navigation tools You can see a wooden handled
magnifying glass You can see a piece that held an
instrument that was used for charting paths along
maps but the wooden elements of these have warped
over time and dried out and there are metallic
bits are rusted a bit
 It could still work The glass hasnt been
touched the housing for it has rusted a little
 Roll an investigation check as you inspect
the bed
 Looking at the cot its a simp
  Okay
 Its a simple cot It looks like the
material bows in the middle where somebody
wouldve slept previously Its stained from
weather over time Looking up at the thatched
roof it looks like theres probably been a few
storms that have battered it enough to the point
where it leaks through and the place itself
doesnt really keep any of the rain at bay what
manages to filter down through the treetops
nearby at least As you push on it the material
tears a bit and beneath it you see a smaller
chest of some kind
 Okay
 Buddy
 The chest is locked it does not appear to
be trapped
 There you go
 You go ahead It opens up nothing seems to
happen Its relatively small its maybe six by
four inches in size You slowly pull it open
moving the cot out of the way Looking inside
immediately you see a small golden statue maybe
three inches tall that is a relatively simple
carving its not extremely detailed The relief
looks like the head of a cobra with the hood open
and the jaw open with fangs drawn Next to that
you see three approximately gold piecesized
rubies Theyre that big around but theyre
fairly thin
 Okay
 You pull them out As you do the weight
thats been distributed outside of the chest
causes it to slide forward At that point you
notice that there is a cord attached to the base
of the chest The weight was holding it in place
As you remove the objects the chest slides back
against the wall as whatever cable is attached to
it goes through a loop through the ceiling and you
feel shifting as a large urn of some kind that is
currently set up inside a thatch roof tips over
and begins to just release a payload on top of
both of you
 It looks to be a cluster of
poisonous snakes dozens of them just stumble down
from above What do you guys do
 Go ahead and make a dexterity check
 Dexterity saving throw
 Yes
 You duck out of the way to the back
get your crossbow ready and look down The snakes
hit the ground with a sludgy slap All of these
snakes have long been dead mostly decomposed
 Apparently whoever was been
handling this hut hasnt been here for a while
 Sure theyre still mostly
decomposed But the weather at least the
way it was kept up in there wasnt conducive to
any heavy jungle fungus it seems But you harry
that along You through your cantrip manage to
watch as these dull blue and gray spores begin to
apparate in a row across the pile of somewhat
sludgy snake remains
 They appear to be
 You have them You have
everything thats in the
chest you have the gold idol the small snake
head idol and you have these three gold
pieceshaped rubies Theyre about that thick and
that big around Make an investigation check
 Yes It would be perception actually
 You look at the rubies
as youre inspecting them and they have little
scratches at the edges its like slight I
wouldnt say imperfections its not like they
were originally there But you can see small
grooves or lines along the outer edge where
something metal or pointy was used to scrape or picked
 Nothing else Just a few things left behind
and no sign of who once built or at least lived
in this space nearby But they havent been
here for a while whoever they were
 No its just a head about an inch below where
the jaw opens Its about three inches tall altogether
 Kind of yeah Only with no
torso Its just like a snake head thats curled
up and its only from about there to where the
mouth is
 You do also notice the small scrapes yes
 It does not appear to have any runes inscripted on
it Theres no language carved or pressed into the
mold It looks to be like it was sculpted not by a
master artist or sculptor Some of the details are
and the teeth are some of them are a little bent
or offkilter It looks like it was more of a
passion project than a fine piece of craftsmanship
 Captain Avantika crosses her arms and
impatiently goes Whatever it takes if you think
it will give us there safer I trust you and your
specialties
 Not comfortably by any means
 In this ten minutes the blanketed heat and
humidity this jungle tends to hold in is
uncomfortable for those of you more used to the
northern elements of this continent
 The sweat is definitely collecting beneath
all of your armor and clothing pooling in areas
you hadnt expected Your hair is matted against
your face the insects are starting to find their
way to you as the scent of sweaty humanoid draws
them nearby occasionally being bit here and
there You finish casting Identify This is not
magical it doesnt have any magical properties
It seems to be just an idol it looks like it was
attached to something in the past but its
probably literally worth its weight in gold
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Make a perception check
 Looks clear
 I share what is needed I share with them
the elements of the dreams and visions Ive been
given For me it is one thing to have a loyal
crew it is another to have a crew that has faith
in you beyond being just captain I do not want a
mutiny and whats more effective than someone
that thinks that not only are you a proper
captain but you are the link to their god
 There are ranging levels of belief maybe
but I think with the time we spend together and
the willingness to understand the possibilities of
having a captain with such capabilities at their
disposal that well riches are not that far off
on the horizon eh
 Oh do not misunderstand I myself have
gutted and cut down dozens of men who have
attempted to take my position
 Speaking of which and she removes her
dagger and rapier and looks about and you can see
beautiful weapons very well made and very well
kept In fact most of her equipment that she has
you can see her fiddling with occasionally to
adjust and clean things as she moves through
Theres a very forceful intent to make sure
everything is properly placed and well taken care
of on her person She looks about and goes And
as much as we are keeping an eye on us ahead I am
still keeping and eye on all of you of course
 Because while I would like to believe this
newfound kinship could make for some very
incredible possibilities in the future you cross
me and this blade will find your heart faster than
anything youve seen move
 I hope not either She reaches out and
pokes your nose and turns around
 They were off a bit away from everybody
 All right Jamedi Of course They begin
falling into the same positions with both Jamedi
and Nott taking point Everybody make another
stealth check please
 It lasts for an hour
 So yeah its still going for a bit
 Technically its still on Fjord
  Okay
 Okay All doing pretty damn well Continuing
to coast forward for the next hour hour and a
half or so following Jamedis path You can see
him pulling out notes here and there and looking
for different things and occasionally hell come
upon a heavy palm tree or jungle tree that hes
marked with a blade and hes keeping tabs on his
marks to follow his path back to where he
originally found his way Along the way the
insects are getting really obnoxious The buzzing
itself becoming this low droning everpresent
hum but the bites are getting extremely
obnoxious Jamedi acknowledging once he starts
seeing it more and more goes I did not find
them a problem before Perhaps they seem to enjoy
your flavors more than mine
 Theyre not bothering him really it seems
 Hes human
 Okay
 You
 You get a very faint undead aura emanating
from Jamedi

 All right Well first off I need everyone
to make a constitution saving throw
 All righty Not bad Good spread guys
Continuing to press on
 No
 Looks over his shoulder at you
 With a full group like this and trying to
be as quiet as possible I give us about maybe one
day There will be a night of camping along the
way
 There are dangerous things in this jungle
but it is easy to keep out of sight as one man
This many Well not as much
 There are lizardfolk that exist on the
outskirts of this island
 They call the rivers streams and the
inlets home Then there are the people of scale
and fang the snakefolk that exist further in
near this temple Variations of their strange
physical What are you guys doing over there
 How about we hold off Congratulations
 The people that have built around this
temple their variations in how their worship
the boons of this longgone snake god they worship
seems to apparate on their person in different
ways Ive seen some with heads that are full of
serpent features patches of scales yellow eyes
as well as some with limbs themselves transformed
into snakelike forms It is stuff of nightmares
 No that is not the work I do I am not a
fighter by any means My job is to not be seen to
infiltrate recover and expedite my exit
 All right Continuing forward for the next
few hours or so the heat is getting heavier and
heavier as the afternoon sky now greets you You
find yourself stopping to eat and drink water
along the way with what supplies you have
available to you The next few hours or so as it
begins to get darker and darker
 Yes
 Its possible Make a nature check
 You have no clue
 Not a whole lot of jungle insects in or
around Nicodranas unfortunately Nothing catches
your attention necessarily
 Yes its getting steadily darker as you
guys move your way through
 Were there any what
 There are a number of jungle flowers that
you pass
 Sure all right Most of the ones you come
across are like a dull pink in color that fade to
a green at the base Its not a vibrant pink just
enough of that whitish red crossover to appear A
lot of them grow along the base of the roots of
some of these jungle trees and you collect a few
handfuls of them Okay Yes
 Jamedis a few feet ahead Hes currently
leading the path Theyre about  feet from each other
 Jamedi is like What
 What is this This has no bearing on
 Make a persuasion check
 He goes  What is it
  He begins to walk over in your
direction
 Avantika still ten feet from you but is
like What is it you want
 Not specific to the dance no Not to the
boat at the very least
 Jamedi goes This is completely
inconsequential to me and I need to keep an eye on
the path ahead
 Okay So you cast Detect Magic As your
visual aura expands beyond giving you faint bits
of essence of magic around you All of your
friends that have various magical accoutrements
themselves begin to glow on their persons and
around their persons You can see that Avantika
both blades that are currently sheathed give off a
faint aura That seems to be all that you can
notice at the moment
 Jamedi you do not see
 Jamedis already moving by the way hes
ignored both of you and has continued up with the path
 Okay As you catch up the next thing you
see as you turn back is Jamedi hand up behind in
your direction
 As you all begin to listen Beauregard
Caleb and Caduceus you hear the cracking of
branches and twigs and the shifting of jungle
floor Jamedi puts two fingers in the air and then
 Okay so Beauregard and Caleb approach
 Shh you hear coming from Jamedi As you
look just past this clearing you notice a troop
of four figures making their way through to brush
You hear this very low guttural clicking from one
of them You can notice these shapes these
figures in a little bit of the now somewhat fading
dusk light theyre muscular and burly and
hunched You see scaled skin but deeply scaled
all over Not snakelike but more lizardlike
You see long snouts with rows of sharp teeth and a
frill down the back of the neck You can see
makeshift bits of leather strapped together to
form patches of armor across the torso Big heavy
shields carved from some sort of a large shell
that has multiple rows of spines and hooks down
the back of it You see clubs and heavy blades
that are made of makeshift scavenged metal or
weapons that have washed up on shore or have been
recovered from others that have been unlucky to
make their way to this island and never returned
 Four of them Each one of them has a spear
 Okay make a perception check
 Yashas cupping behind her ear going
What
 At this point you hear a sudden impact
 Glancing over Caleb you
watch as behind them on the bushes in the opposite
side of this small path they are walking through
you see three arrows Two of these lizardfolk
tumble to the ground to one knee  They
turn around and two people in purpleish robes
with basic jewelry and leather bands rush forward
with daggers and a scimitar in the other hand and
slash out and start hacking These lizards are now
being assaulted by these people and behind them
one burly man with weathered dark skin exposed
chest and these large billowing thick arms that
look like two very long fivefoot serpents that
come protruding out the sides of the shoulders
into these two separate snakeheads full with eyes
and teeth rush forward and slam biting into the
throat of one of the lizardmen He goes 
and gets pulled to the ground
 His arms are snakes The two other people
look human but in the middle of this chaos you
can see their eyes are bright yellow with the
serpentine snake eye slit in the center Now the
lizard men are pulling up their shields One of
them has been carved down on the ground The one
with the big hand has pulled the throat closed to
the point where its slowly dying on the floor
They have completely gone into this combat between
the two of them
 Its about  or  feet They havent
noticed any of you here and you are currently
completely in shadows What do you do
 No
 Too far away
 Yeah
 Yeah About a foot wide and they spiral
upward and then they snap into giant fangs that
protrude and snap on each His face is intense and
grinning This is a hunting party One of the
lizardmen grabs his spear and jams it into the
abdomen of the man with the snake arms Looks back
and hisses at him angrily Manages to pull the
spear free with one of the snake hands leaps
over pole vaulting off the ground the other
snakehead coming out and snapping into the
shoulder and chest area of the snakeman and then
throwing him up into the air You hear 
as he goes flying spinning up into the boughs
lands on the ground He stands back up grabs his
shield and you can see him woozy Theres this
black color where the impact of the wound was and
you see the veins growing dark It stumbles and
falls onto its knees and then falls to the ground
 One by one you watch as each of the
lizardmen are felled from the ambush and
 Yes Two of which looked to be comparably
smaller creatures but they just werent prepared
and while the three snakeman hunting party
appeared to have sustained a few blows and
injuries they were successful
 Correct As youre inspecting you can see
patches of skin across their shoulders and a part
of the chest you can see scales that appear and
then vanish With the battle done the quiet hits
and they begin to walk off to a small patch where
they had dropped some sort of a satchel They
start pulling out rope and they start tying the
legs together of these lizardmen until they have
two of them tied on one side and the other two
tied ankletoankle on the other The one with the
two snake arms picks up both and begins dragging
them behind him in the jungle while the other two
flank and look out into the grass below They
begin making their way deeper towards the path
where they came away from you Their hunt
successful theyre bringing their meal back with them
 The direction youve been traveling has been
a little zigzaggy because its been following
Jamedis path and the marking hes making so
youre not entirely certain It seems it could be
parallel to the path youre going but since you
dont know the final destination youre not
entirely certain if itll line up with it or not
 His hands still up hes just watching
carefully  Shh What
 We are not to get anywhere near these
creatures
 So I have noticed
 I did It was quite frightening
 It is a very good question One that will
keep me up late at night
 Youre not sure if hes joking Do you guys
do anything else or you just let them pass and
continue on
 Make an investigation check
 Yeah its a thick jungle canopy It breaks
in places
 Amongst the ground where the battle took
place you can see there are mashed plants and
streaks of thick lizardmen blood a few broken
teeth that are scattered in the sand there but
nothing beyond that of value
 Okay So you get three lizardmen teeth
 Its up to you
 I I have been
 Good to know Now that enough time has
passed and Jamedi feels comfortable he puts his
hand down and goes All right we press forward
Follow me I feel well have to make camp soon
There is a ruin in front that might give us some
cover Continuing on
 He keeps his eyes trained forward but goes
I imagine it would be difficult to relieve oneself
 He turns around and goes Shh It is a
valid point but I need you to be quiet please
 Continuing on the sun sets and the sky
goes through its cycle of oranges to pinks to
purples to blues You havent quite reached this
aforementioned ruin before night falls Now the
evening insects begin to grow louder and louder
The nocturnal creatures begin to let out the
nocturnal calls The perpetual din of the various
clicks and cricket noises and other various
flapping insects mating calls into the night
become this constant droning sound around you
While the insect bites have subsided this sound
itself is uncomfortable For those of you who are
used to more comfortable sleep you begin to dread
the possibility of finding a nights rest in this
 Ritual cast of
 Jamedi says Perhaps we wait until we get
to the ruin just so we have some cover beyond the trees
 Whos keeping watch on this first bit of a
night travel
 All right Roll perception as will Jamedi
  Okay
 Okay Following this little chain of lights
that pop and glow as it goes eventually you come
upon the first signs of stone rubble Some sort of
structure was built here long ago and has since
fallen over and elements of its masonry either
moved or reclaimed for other structures elsewhere
on the island but you can see the basis of walls
and joining positions where elements of this
previous building were used to maintain and hold
the ceiling that has since fallen in There is a
series of walked paths that carved through the
various ferns and heavy bush but you do find the
back of one of these walls where Jamedi says
This is where I slept previously Perhaps this is
the best place to rest So He begins to set up
a small tent arranging against the wall What do
you guys do
 Jamedi goes I am unfamiliar with what this
bubble is you speak of
 I am okay He heads back to configuring
his tent Avantika tilts her head and goes I
assume this is some sort of protective measure for
your nights rest
 Then I would be delighted to join you
 Believe me it is my honor
 Sheathes the rapier but keeps the dagger
drawn turned around in her hand so its face down
and looks over her shoulder both ways out towards
the darkness So how spacious is this As you
finish the spell the strange colored orb appears
there on the side of the ruins
 Yeah theres a couple of small stone
elements there
 The stone here make an intelligence
check
 You dont have specific information on it
Its quite old It might be older than this age
might have existed preCalamity or at least
somewhere in that neighborhood But youre not
entirely certain
 Youre going to look around what
 Okay And youre accompanying him
 The rest of you are staying within the
sphere gray color dimly lit on the interior It
can be whatever light source you want at this
point The two of you wander around the ruin Make
an investigation check if you dont mind
 Okay As you walk through and pore over the
ruins the structure is fairly simple This wasnt
some beautifullymade stone hall Most of the
stones here were probably pulled from rivers or
were smoothed over and theyre varying sizes and
the masonry is very simple
 Not particularly You dont know if its a
temple it could have been an abode It doesnt
appear to be huge There seem to be one or two
adjacent rooms that were set in that space
 Nothing from the Detect Undead no
 No
 Correct Whats the range on that
 Right understood Caduceus whats your
armor class
 As youre looking over the stonework and
turning to Jester to mention you didnt see much
  There is a shape that moves out of
the shadows with incredible speed The light the
faint color being emanated from Caduceus cantrip
immediately falls away and you see the streak of
his hair disappear in the nearby shadow I need
you to make a strength saving throw
 You watched him be pushed off into a nearby
bush
 Thats a fail You get pushed off land on
the ground you tumble and are held prone on the
ground as what little bit of light you can see
not having darkvision unfortunately what you
see is a faint glimmer of two large white fangs a
smattering of whiskers right before you this
growl sound and a cluster of snake heads that
bend around each side of the head
 The bite attack hits you That is only five
points of piercing damage Actually it gets
advantage on the second one Okay with the
advantage it does hit and the other one the
snakes all snap onto you multiple snake bites
all biting across your face and your throat For
that you suffer eight points of piercing damage
and you need to make a constitution saving throw please
 Ooh
 Thats a success You take half damage You
only take  points of poison damage
 Correct Jester you see the shape and you
glance over and you can see with your darkvision
this tenfootlong leopardlike cat that is
currently now pressed onto the chest and body of
Caduceus It bites down towards him and all these
strange protrusions from around the shoulders and
head area all strike down as a few of them curl
back and look at you and in that bit you can see
a few beats of light faint bits of starlight and
moon that are coming down and reflecting in the
eyes of these snake heads And you hear this
 up behind you on the ruin where you
were just standing Ill be right back
 Caduceus you are over here Jester you are
here
 Now the rest of you are over so Jamedis
over here in his tent The rest of you are all
clustered inside the hut Caduceus
 I need everyone to roll initiative
Technically you guys dont hear anything so well
see when it comes around your turn
 You hear sounds but theres been no sound
yet You guys have been setting yourselves up for
the evening there The only person that would have
probably noticed would have been Caduceus
  to 
 If you want to get that
 Yes you do
  to  Nobody  to 
  to ten
 All righty Ten to five
 Fjord and Nott got the same All right
Caleb
 Beau youre up first but you have not
noticed anything so your turn is spent fluffing
your space to sleep for the evening
 Caduceus
 You all immediately hear
  does not hit
 Its a melee spell attack
 Go ahead and roll for an attack
 Its a d plus your spell attack modifier
  hits Go ahead and roll damage for the
Vampiric Touch
 Theyre next and then Jester youre up
 As you reach up your hand grasps its throat
and this strange hissing sound happens as you pull
life force energy out of it Its strange threads
of purplishblack energy that pull into your body
your wounds healing up slightly
 You can see a faint bit of energy coming out
of Caduceus
 Is that your turn
 Youre prone so its half movement to try
and crawl away Or you can spend half your
movement to get up and then you still have half
your movement to try and escape if you want
 All righty So you get up from prone
 To here
 You can go right there and not get an attack
of opportunity
 That finishes Caduceus turn Its now their
turn The one up top whos hissing down at you
 As its jaw opens this
semitranslucent rolling cloud of dust and gas
emanates in a footcone
 I need you both to make constitution saving
throws please
  You manage to resist the effect
 Jester you inhale it suddenly caught
offguard by it and your eyes blink and go dark as
you fall unconscious
 Yep
 Like unconscious Not zero hit points but
asleep unconscious
 Yes All right
 It is going to move jump down from here
and begin to move this way to flank you Caduceus
Now flanking you is going to attempt to strike at
you twice Good to know I forgot about that
Bite this ones claws so its going to be with
advantage Okay that is going to make it an  to hit
 Because theyre flanking you
 All right so the bite attack You take six
points of piercing damage and the snakes snap at
you That is going to be a 
 You take another ooh thats ten points of
piercing damage At this point as youre between
the two of them the one behind you that just put
Jester to sleep all its snakes snap around you
the back of your head and your neck and your
shoulders and you feel the poison through your
veins Roll another constitution saving throw
please
 Two of the clerics went out on a solo
mission
   just no  succeeds
 Half that is going to be  points of poison
damage
 All righty theyre done Jester you are
unconscious and sleeping
 That brings us to Avantika and Jamedi
 What the shit is that pulls out the
rapier and the dagger and darts leaping over
 just seeing these creatures rushes
forward Hiyah and is leaping forward with her
rapier and blade and is going to make three
attacks The gray is going to be with the dagger
one rapier shot misses then one for the rapier
and one for the dagger hits For the dagger that is
 And another ten points of damage on that
 It was a seven and a ten Then Avantika
seems to be holding both blades ready preparing
to defend herself Jamedi who stumbles out of his
tent is only half movement glances over and can
barely see whats there Hes on the inside of the
dome pulls out his shortbow and is going to
attempt to shoot it with an arrow and misses with
a four A natural four There is no light source
here it seems to disappear in the distance That
finishes with his turn That brings us to Yasha
 She can get to about there
 That is within melee yes
  will hit
 d plus an additional d
 So no its just d because you werent
raging
 All right You added the three points for
strength right
 Nine point of damage You got it Second
attack
  That hits Go ahead and roll damage d
plus three Plus four technically because
 Got it
 There you go That finishes up Yashas turn
Fjord and Nott you guys up
 Okay so you leave the thing you can see
everyone right there
 You do You see that one beast right there
  does not hit
 Right here
 All righty
 Role a stealth check
 You are stealthed there Okay so that
finishes Notts go Fjord what are you doing
 You come around the edge and you turn and
see right there in front of you another one of
these leopardlike creatures and youre like Oh
shit You didnt even notice there was a second
one there
 Go for it
  misses unfortunately
 Thatll work
 You blast and almost force it off of its
feet for a second It catches itself 
  All the snakes turn to look at you
for a second That finishes Fjords go Caleb
youre up
 It vanishes
 Over here you mean
 All righty
 Yeah all right DC  That is a wisdom
 All right that is a success  on the
first roll Thats that one there The other one
natural  plus two they both succeed Im so
sorry
 Those were good rolls on their part Does
that finish your turn Caleb
 You have maybe five feet Ill say right
here So you start backing away Back at the top
of the round Beau youre up The orb has
vanished everyone has rushed out you look over
and you can hear these growls and snarls and
impacts Combat is happening What are you doing
 Over this way you mean
 All right First off roll an acrobatics
check to make it over the wall
 Yeah youre fine 
 Go for it
  misses unfortunately
 Go for it
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Five points of damage with your second
strike
 No you just need to hit it once
 Yeah all right constitution saving throw
That is a natural one So you miss the first
strike but as you roundhouse kick you manage to
kick right up in its abdomen You feel ribs break
and buckle under the impact of the kick Some sort
of chain reaction spirals across its nervous
system as it falls to its side It is stunned
until the end of your next turn
 Yes you can do that Yes
 Go for it You have advantage on these I
believe Yep
 It would have been fine Its the same
either way So  points of damage
 After its stunned you get up and wail on
him The second hit managing to plunge right
towards where its kidney is and you dont feel
any sort of muscular resistance as your fist sinks
about an inch or two into its body You pull back
It doesnt break the skin but you can feel you
hurt some meaty organs in the inside Does that
finish your turn Beau
 All right Caduceus
 Correct
 Go for it You have advantage on it
 Yeah that hits Roll damage
 You heal three back
 Okay You turn invisible
 Until the end of your next turn
 It hears you moving and swipes out It has
disadvantage on the strike The snakes swing out
towards you That is a  to hit
 You dodge out of the way The snakes all
snap out in the middle of the air
 Okay That ends your go Its now their
turn
 The other one that currently seeing all the
individuals cluster in the area begins to back
up and its torso swells and its lower jaw opens
and  The other one now releases a
similar burbling cloud right there Avantikas
going to have to make a constitution saving throw
Fails Avantika falls asleep
 Its a cloud
 Yep I need you to make a constitution save
Nott
 Youre fine Make it
 You succeed
 You succeed
 Yasha was just out of the range of it
actually With that its going to attempt to run
off this way and dart Yasha gets one strike on
it
 Cant reckless is on your turn
 Thatll hit
 As she strikes wide with the blade the
creature  Its limping a little bit and
its trying to back away Its unable to move from
where it is Its speed is reduced to zero So it
turns to now look at the two unconscious figures
on the ground That one is stunned so it cant do
anything Jester youre up Youre asleep
 Avantika cant do anything Shes asleep
Jamedi is going to move here next to the trees for
cover Hes going to reload his shortbow and take
a shot at that natural 
 All right Thats eight damage with the
shortbow
  Well done Thats fantastic
Thats going to end his turn That brings us to Yasha
 No Moms Jamedi is pretty great
 She going to move
 Shes not Great Weapon Master no
 Roll d and then double that
  plus six I believe So  points of
damage Yeah How does Yasha want to do this
 The body attempts to leap and the head
stumbles underneath with some of the snake heads
The momentum carries it but it runs straight into
the base of the tree crossing the way before 
on the ground The head still  Coming
to rest on the ground
 She could yeah If she has the rest of her
movement she can use it to move up
 Its melee
 That hits
 The d only happens on the first attack So
its only d for the second one
 Okay got it Plus six so  Okay got it
That finishes Yashas go Fjord and Nott you guys are up
  hits You have advantage on that shot
because it is stunned
 Yeah so sneak attack on them
  points of damage to it struck The blow
hits and sinks in The creatures looking hurt
but its still standing though it is stunned
 With advantage because its still stunned
  will do yeah
 Correct You only get once per round
 All righty its looking really hurt Its
real hurt
 Well Fjord what are you doing
 Because you guys are going at the same time
you can figure out these are simultaneous
 Two strikes on it
  just hits These are with advantage
because its stunned dont forget
 Yeah both hit
  points of damage how do you and Nott
want to do this
 Its torso erupts in green flame and energy
just  The body slinks to the ground in
a smoldering cinder and as its head 

 You guys all take a moment Make a
perception check of the jungle around you
  okay
 You can use an action to wake her
 Jester you come to consciousness and youre
halfcurled on Avantika whos halfcurled on you
since you guys passed out right next to each
other
 Okay Make a deception check
 I know Theres still motions involved
 As you bend down and focus on the blade
which one the dagger or the rapier
 The rapier is a plus one rapier Nothing too
crazy or special
 Okay She comes to and pushes you away for a
second and pulls the blade and puts her back up to
the wall and has both blades out and is coming to
consciousness but instinctually is defensive
 From what brief encounter you had its hard
to say Make a nature check actually no this
would not be a nature This is not a natural
creature Make a general intelligence check
  They dont appear to be Theyre more
intelligent than some creatures in nature but
there isnt any sort of
 Yeah still animalistic They are natural to
this island at the very least
 Okay
 You complete your ritual spell and the Tiny
Hut is completed
 At this point Jamedi goes Actually I
will be if possible interested in staying within
this this time
 He grabs a few things from the tent and
its a very tight space Nine creatures is the
max right Youve hit the maximum You all manage
to fit in there in a not terribly comfortable space
 Sprinkle who is not necessarily used to the
type of weather appears to be very uncomfortable
in the heat and being tucked into the cloth and is
like 
 This is the crimson weasel The dog is with
the Ruby of the Sea
 Just walking along the hat
 Avantika puts the finger up towards
Frumpkin
 Interesting
 Not one so small and adorable and is
docile
 What in all of my years
 I dont know I stopped counting at around

 But in my line of work its important to
not hesitate when some drunk asshole tries to I
dont know take your ship
 Well anyway I will be taking a nap with
one eye open Good night everyone She settles
into her camping garb Whos keeping watch All
right Make perception checks for the first watch guys
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah thats true
 Avantika who as mentioned before was
sleeping with one eye open essentially is rested
there and then right as you begin to go through
the actions of casting there is a flash of motion
 What is Frumpkins armor class
 Frumpkin suffers five points of piercing
damage as Avantika instinctually 
 Why did you do that
 And you know why I did that
 Be glad it was just your owl Please do not
go peering where it is not wanted eh
 Recycling Frumpkin
 You finish your watch seemingly uneventful
Towards the tail end of it you do see a shape of
another one of those leopardlike creatures that
stalks on the outskirts of the strange opaque orb
youve created and approaches it 
Circles around it for a bit prods at it every now
and then Spends about  minutes or so keeping a
watch and then eventually loses interest and
wanders off into the jungle
 All right next watch Whos taking next
watch We only need one more watch I think Jester
 Make a perception check
 Jamedi stays up to also take watch with you
Oh nice He sits across the opposite way and
youre watching this way over his shoulder and
hes looking over yours and doesnt engage in
conversation unless you wish to
 I have seen them my first time passing
through here yes but I was quieter
 You are correct This has been a bit more
challenging than I originally anticipated
 No
 I am confused as to what you are speaking
of
 You are strange
 And creepy
 It takes a solid ten seconds of him
inspecting it and looking up at you before he
 Much appreciated
 Tucks it away into the inside of his vest
  Youre not quite sure who it
was on that side that let one loose in their
sleep but the inside of the dome suddenly has a
very fragrant air
 Really the most impressive of miracles
 Only for this journey and once before
 She pays well Does not judge
 Working for other people
 His eyes narrow at you I was the only
survivor to the escaping singular mines to the
north area of the continent How far have you
traveled outside of the Empire
 All right
 I have delved into a few ruins I have been
lucky enough to survive by working alone I have
seen many friends fall and disappear but I have
made my way Whats the craziest thing you have seen
 Sure
 Will wonders ever cease

 Im going to concentrate on our
surroundings for the remainder of our shift if you
do not mind
 He looks out Now towards the tail end of
your shift as the sunlight begins to slowly peak
 There is some more shifting in the nearby
bushes and you see two figures beginning to
approach the sphere
 Shh He gets his short bow ready and nocks
an arrow
 Maybe Just shh As you guys wait you can
see similar to what you had previously seen in
your travels on this island two lizard men
armored One carrying a net thats slung over his
shoulder the other with a long spear both with
shields off to the side Not ready for aggression
but they both approach slowly towards the strange
sphere and begin inspecting it
  He pokes it with the
spear The other one steps forward and licks it
They both begin to walk around and inspect it
prod and poke it Jamedi you can see hes just
looking out very intensely bow notched
 They both circle around the back end of it
poke the dome a few more times One of them picks
up a rock and throws it at it It skips off of the
exterior of it and rests in a nearby bush They
both step forward one more time and smell it
closely They both turn around and begin to make
their way in the opposite direction of where the
dome is set making their way further into the
jungle clearing One of them stops and looks back
behind one more time at the dome and turns back
and both of them vanish into the nearby brush
 It is Theres no sign of the sun but its
that early morning soft blue that starting to
overtake the evenings night
 I would say that they are probably very
close to the ones we saw before
 They appear to be of the lizard men
heritage
 You did get a long rest
 All right collect your belongings He
goes over and starts disassembling his tent
quickly rolling it up and putting it into his
pack over his shoulder You guys gather your things
 Make a survival check Beau
 There are a series of foot grooves in the
dirt
 It doesnt look like anybody slept here It
looks like a bunch of people kicked here
 Yeah You gather your things Jamedi leads
you back towards the jungle All right a few more
hours and I think well be in the outskirts of the
village
 All right So yes
 Oh there are plenty of these snake people
where they live Well have to be very quiet
Well have to gauge our passage through their town
and try to not be seen And if we are seen
eliminate whoever catches us before it can notify
the rest of them of our presence Make our way
towards the central structure Trust me Youll
know it when you see it He looks back to
Avantika and says And I believe that is the

 All right So now in the early morning
daylight
 In the early morning daylight on Urukaxl
Island you trudge deeper and deeper into the
jungles as the low mist in the jungle begins to
burn away as the day itself grows warmer All of
you getting a bit more adjusted to the temperature
and general atmosphere Beau youre feeling a
little rough
 You get this sweating a little bit and this
soreness in your body and this general body pain
kind of a dull pain throughout
 Just kind of  youre not quite
sure why its come over you Pressing on Jamedi
leads you for about another hour and a half two
hours through the jungle before putting his hand
up once more to stop you all Oh we didnt make
the stealth check actually Because I said when
come back yes
 Pass Without a Trace everybody
 No youve slept
 
 There you go Caleb
 Okay and then Yasha Natural  not bad
 You guys are cruising your way through the
jungle and using that score as you approach
Jamedi with his hand out behind him stopping you
Glancing just past his shoulder you can see the
jungle trees begin to clear and the first thing
that catches your eye beyond this treeline you
can see a few dozen scattered stone buildings
most of them in relatively good shape immediately
coming into view You can see the stone coloration
is more of a sandstone yellowish to a dull gray
and white with different materials used to accent
elements of the constructions This doesnt match
the ruins you previously slept in the night
before These appear to be fresher You can see
the verdant green jungle vines and roots begin to
entwine and tangle near the base of some of them
and where its built looks like parts of the
jungle have grown up around and helped camouflage
elements of this small village You can see
elements of the exposed stone carry snakehead
obelisks that appear to be softly carved from bits
of a marble material or recovered stone in a
similar way that most of the construction has been
done
 Similar sculpt and design though larger and
of more detail You see these obelisks about ten
feet tall and they tend to be markers at different
intersections of travel You can see probably a
dozen or so folk immediately at this position that
youre at that are wandering through this city
Some are gathering materials You can see
actually up the way across one of these walls you
see four figures that are strung up by their feet
You can see the remnants of the lizard men that
are in the process of having the flesh filleted
from their bodies
 You see one of the more humanoid ones
probably one of the hunters that you saw alongside
the snakearmed man is there with the blade
stripping it off the bones and sloughing it into a
pile next to it where you hear  over
on top of each other
 Make a perception check
 Hard to tell at this distance Youd have to
get a lot closer
 All right you take your mote of
possibility
 Make a medicine check
 Looking at her while all of you are fairly
warm and sweaty her complexion is paler than you
recall There is quite a bit of sweat more so
than expected that is streaming down her body
Her vision appears to be not as focused and shes
not making eye contact with you as she speaks to
you Lids are a bit droopy She doesnt look
healthy
 What are you casting
 Okay You finish casting the spell the
energy subsides you pull back and theres no
change in her demeanor
 Based on your medicine check it looks to be
not a toxin This is more of a disease taking hold
 For the time being just as a note as this
is coming to be noticed all of your constitution
saving throws are at disadvantage
 No
 Not from what you can tell Youre not
entirely certain what the disease is
 Its some sort of an insectdistributed
jungle ailment
 Yeah
 But at least she got to watch our driver
almost beat up that guy
 That was amazing Anyway back to task
 As you guys slightly press forward Jamedi
showing you a bit of a path off to the side He
glances towards the path where he was going and
one thing that catches your attention is youve
seen the men with the snake arms youve seen the
folk with the scaled skin patches What you see
now towards this one stairway portion that now
leads to what you previously didnt see below the
tree line but a massive stone structure beset by
these stairs on each of its five sides Envision
like a semblance of an Aztec pyramid but a
fiveside shape that levels off at the top and
there are stairs on each of these five sides At
the base of the nearest one you see less of a man
and more of a giant snake maybe twelve to fifteen
feet long coiled and muscular But to a humanoid
torso with two heavy loglike arms that rest at
its sides One resting on this large sheathed
scimitarlike blade its head curled up into this
heavy straight serpent snakelike mouth as its
jaw kind of hangs open and its tongue hissing
noise Its just keeping an eye and it slithers
across the road bowing from side to side as it
looks across the tree line
 The base of the structure Youre seeing a
variety of these snake people going about their
lives This one is just keeping a watch in that
one element and Jamedi you can hear curse under
his breath It was the path I took to the inside
last time Were going to have to improvise Which
way do you want to go
 Avantikas like Of course inside that big
thing right there
 As far as I can remember it was fairly
clear but it is also I had to ensure that there
was not many watching They have these like
right there He points over the side and you can
see along the stairs almost like
a withered person You see them like a smaller
human hunched forward their body a light green
tint to itself kind of this wrinkled scaled
body its neck protruding and curved outward It
looks what a like the lizard folk you had seen
earlier but with a longer neck and almost
geriatric in the way they carry themselves
forward lumbering Carrying a large spear and
appears to be watching like a sentinel across the
upper portion of this large stone structure
 From what you can tell from this distance
its hard to see but it looks to be more serpent
and more snakelike
 And you can see theres about four or so
buildings between where you are and the base of
the structure Theres a small village that
surrounds the base of this temple And so you guys
have to find your way through this city
 Avantika goes Uh that is not really a
specialty of mine However Im very good at not
being seen And Jamedi goes Its also my
specialty Perhaps we can come from a different
direction smaller group The two of us can meet
on the way
 They both look at you and say The whole
point of this was to make it a small group The
more we add to this group the harder it is for us
to do this
 Yashas just sitting there with her arms
crossed just listening to the whole conversation going
 I mean kind of
 Like the wings
 Make a perception check
 Looking around you dont see many cloaks
The weather here is warm enough to the point where
there isnt the need to bundle Theres no need
for hoods because the society here wants to make
sure they can very quickly identify whos a part
of their faction and who isnt So yeah theres
no cloaks You see what are like open robes
simple bits of cloth just to cover aspects of the
body for protection from the sun or otherwise but
beyond that its mostly just skin and scales
 There are people that look mostly like
people from a distance but upon closer look
their skin in places that gets a greener hue in
patches their eyes are yellow Very snakelike
eyes Sharper teeth
 Now that youve watched the first view you
had was only the first few buildings in front of
you Now that youve stepped forward and glanced
you can see theres maybe about  to  buildings
that sit around the base of this entire temple
Youve seen a few dozen in the streets so the
society here you can assume somewhere in the
neighborhood of like one to three hundred people
live in the city total
 Okay so youre applying them to Yasha and
Beau and Caleb
 Purple robes simple cloth skirts Most of
the whole thing thats worn there is for general
protection and adornment You can see jewelry
adorning some of them but its very simple and
its more for purpose than anything extravagant or
presentational
 Avantika goes Ill be watching Au
revoir And she kind of
 I figure the top of that would be a very
effective place to meet Is that not correct That
is where you entered last time non She turns
to Jamedi whos keeping low to the ground and
goes That is indeed where I was There is a room
inside there I could not walk into I could not
find a way through That is when I returned So
well meet there Avantika goes Au revoir
Waves her hand through the air and marks a few
symbols and you watch as she disappears
 Thats what were going to find out right
now Youre proficient with your disguise kit so
its proficiency bonus plus Ill say dexterity
check to see how well you can apply these details
to their bodies Roll for each one of them
 For Caleb
 Caleb has these green circles on his face in
splotches And youre like Great For Beau
 Beau actually pretty good job the
linework and shading you had done in these various
patches on the inside of the brow line helps make
her look a little more snakelike Youve sunken
the jowls youve done the scattered patches with
the patchmarks
 Yasha seems strangely excited Me next me
next
 You guys look amongst yourselves while shes
working on Yasha and finally she finishes and
voila Pulls back and its just Grinch Just
green head to toe Bright green Its pretty bad
But you feel pretty confident about it
 Yasha goes Okay Lets do this
 Agreed
 Well I hadnt left yet I was curious to
see your
 You dont see the voice is coming from
nowhere
 Make a perception check
 Looking around you do not see Jamedi
immediately in the vicinity
 No this is Avantika
 I was not aware but now I am very curious
as to where you found this information and what
you think this means
 Hes done work for me before and was
successful
 Dont worry about it But nevertheless he
has done his job so far I assume we just keep a
close eye If ever he decides to give any sign of
turning on any of us well its eight against one
 See you on the other side And you watch
as the dust  the footprints
 Your Pass Without a Trace has probably faded
at this point with the travel youve made so you
have to recast it to get the spell bonus
 Everyone make a stealth check please
 Stealth checks guys
 And for Yasha if you want to roll twice
 You all begin to make your way towards the
first set of buildings Theres that one
individual thats flaying the bodies of the
lizardmen Has made their way through two of them
There are two more that are in the process of
being stripped There is one street that breaks
through two of the ones closest to you Do you
wish to take that path What do you wish to do to
stealth in Because part of the pathway here is
out in the open so youd have to gauge your timing
 Where you are now towards the main stairway
that leads at the top you have about two streets
or three sets of buildings to get through The
ones closest to you there are two large buildings
that are immediately towards your side One side
has nobody around it The other one has one
individual that is currently flaying the hanging
corpses of the four lizardmen
 Okay You make your way exiting the jungle
way and are you going quickly and quietly so
nobody notices or are you strolling through using
your stealth as a means of trying to keep any sort of
 Got you Okay All of you move forward Are
you dragging them behind by ropes
 Got you
 You guys cluster and begin to shift as this
herd of snakefolk making your way towards that direction
 As the light hits you as you leave the
branches of the jungle and begin shifting fully
open now in the middle of the midday sun
immediately you feel the heat on the back of your
neck and shoulders begin to grow hotter and hotter
as the nerves build up inside You cruise through
the open area and to the left you hear a whip
cracking You glance over and you can see another
one of those massive mostlysnake serpentine
hulking individuals is currently wielding a whip
There is a cluster of lizardmen that are currently
chained and are currently pushing on a heavy bar
that is dragging a large piece of stone out of the
jungle and towards the center of the city Theyre
bent into slave labor for these people They are
now pushing it forward That catches you off guard
for a minute but you continue to focus and move
forward As you get closer you can hear the slick
sound of the flesh being pulled from the back of
the lizardmans body 
 Onto the side  Had me a little
bit of spittle on that one  Pardon me
Moving around the side the figure finishes and
throws it and glances over and looks at your
group Starts looking somewhat curiously as you
pass
 Make a deception check Jester
 Yashas going to make a deception check as
well
 All right Yasha rolled pretty high on that
actually The figure goes back to its work and
begins carving it You move past that into the
first street walkway It moves on for about
fifteen or so feet and then it has a crosspath It
goes to the right and the left and ahead it goes
to another set of buildings behind and there is
an alley that turns to the right and it seems to
end at that point So you have a T intersection
before you and then it ends and curves to the
right Where do you go
 Right You keep moving and then theres a
right and left or you keep moving and then it
turns to the right
 You see open squares Theres no glass
panes but there are carved rectangles removed
 Thats my fault Its a lowercase t
Lowercase t
 Sorry I meant a cross intersection
 No its fine Its an important
clarification Thats my brain fart man I
appreciate the backup But yeah youre right on
that
 Namaste
 As hes saying this you glance to the
window to your left and as you look in make a
perception check
 You glance inside and its a simple
interior Theres a little bit of sunlight coming
through from the opposite side of it from the
direction of the light in the sky It frames
ambiently the outside of a figure that appears to
be humanoid that is sitting over a table and you
can hear some grinding or carving sound but its
faced away from you Looks to be some sort of workshop
 You push towards the first intersection
 Yeah you can see the top of the temple from
here
 Itll start making towards the nearest
stairway that leads towards the top
 As you approach the Tintersection you hear
this murmuring of conversation coming from the
lefthand side of it 
 You do and you pick it up It is Abyssal
 I dont know if you had her character
sheet you would have the benefits of knowing
that But not my responsibility So you pick you
on it and the muttering is akin to Come we have
to pick up the hunts The food stores are running
dry this season As that comes to you you glance
up to the side and you guys watch as two figures
round the corner Theyre both mostly human in
body though their bodies are scaled and a dull
greengray color Their heads fully serpentine
snake jaws the hoods not open but retracted
and they both have strapped across their
shoulders and torsos longbows that are at rest
and they have quivers filled with arrows They
walk past and glance over at the rest of your
crew Make a deception check Jester
 Yasha as well The disguise didnt quite go
well and Yasha and Caleb even in the clustered
section catches some attention The first one
keeps walking The second one glances over and
looks to the rest of you and Hey You hear in
Abyssal Hey whatve you got You guys hear 
 She goes  Shes not used to
rolling with the punch
 She goes down and the figure looks up its
eyes narrowing and the tongue 
 Wait to the other one who stops looks
back and goes begins to walk towards you
keeping a hand on the bow
 On both of them
 Thats a failure thats a  Oh thats
cocked And a natural four They both fail They
both freeze in place
 Youre in the middle of the street
 They are currently paralyzed in the middle
of the street for the next minute Once theyre
released theyre going to do whatever they do
 Right now Make a perception check
 Glancing about at this moment the only
other figure you can see near this intersection is
one of the patrolling hunched creatures you saw
up on the temple itself on the second tier and
its currently walking away from you and doesnt
seem to be paying attention
 Hold on While you guys are deciding on
this every turn they get to make a save
 Natural two and  plus two  Yeah
theyre still held
street
 You guys lift their arms and pull them off
 The building to the left of you was the one
that you saw the craftsman in The one to the
right you can see there is an open doorway
 All right you drag them over
 Okay make a perception check
 You glance inside You can see what looks to
be a pile of rags on a small table in the corner
but nobody else appears to be in there
 All right You guys pull them inside
 Another  plus two  failure An eight
plus two theyre still
 Thats a five
 
 Whats your DC
 One of them succeeds
 Youre in the process of it
 The guys thats paralyzed going ahead and
attack
 Attack twice each time with advantage
 Both hits are crits because he is
paralyzed
  hits
 Yep both hit both crit
 One saved
 You were tying them up and  begins
to but well get to that in just a minute
 You carve through him These are more ranged
hunters theyre not as hardy as some of the other
ones out there and this one you manage to in
just two quick swings carve through the chest and
take down most of the throat just tears open It
crumples to the ground dead The other who is
currently being bound  begins to start
making noise and getting ready to
 Youre inside a stone room
 Theres not much in the way of wood Its
mostly stone in here
 Fire Bolt or Fireball
 Okay
 Itll make a little bit
 Go ahead and roll an attack everyone whos
doing this
 Okay it is definitely flanked so you get a
sneak attack but you dont have advantage on it
because it is not fully bound
 That hits
 Hits
 Hits
 Natural nine fails
 Whats the Fire Bolt do
 Okay You watch as he  freezes up
from the stun and then  takes a bolt to
the throat The eyes begin to roll back as a Fire
Bolt blasts in its chest and you watch as it
burns the edges of its face up in cinders It goes
quiet before limping to the ground the smoke
coming up from its smoldering corpse
 At this point the rags in the corner begin
to shift as you watch what appears to be an
individual sleeping in the corner begins to come
to and it 
 Look up and you can see what looks to be a
more humanoid one of the most humanoid of the
ones ones youve seen there but with the scales
what you managed to make yourself look like
begins to come to consciousness and goes

 Yeah you woke him the middle of his sleep
 That is  it succeeds
 
 Go for it The words you hear are Who are
you Help as the shout is beginning to come out
but you go ahead and
 Yeah  that hits
 Thats a failure yeah
 Stuns in the bed
 All right This individual doesnt have a
lot of hit points so lets say for the sake of
brevity here being stunned you guys quickly
Yep However it did have the opportunity to shout
out one phrase Well see if the guard heard it
 Its a natural 
 Inside this chamber its all stone
Therere stone tablets that have been carved and
then placed up against each other Theres
occasional scenes you can see through and the
ceiling above appears to be slats of stone that
have been placed in a lattice formation
 The ceiling looking up there is no second
floor or anything and it looks like its just a
continuation of stone It looks like a series of
thin slats have been placed one next to the other
in a layering to create a ceiling
 No this entrance is the only way in and
out Theres a window
 You guys turn the corner and as you exit
you can see that large looming slithering snake
figure with the huge scimitar thats probably 
foot from tip of tail to nose Thick burly body
slithering its way towards you
 Meaning whatever noise this figure
managed I rolled high on its perception to
pick up the sound of its call and its making its
way in your direction
 All right full sound and everything
Because Major Image you can do the full spread
 So now suddenly in the middle of this
room all of you turn and look and see as a
fullgrown manticore akin to the one that you
battled not that long ago beneath the mines near
Alfield you see wings unfurl  All of a
sudden all eyes in the city shift to this
creature In a matter of moments you can see
arrows being loosed in its direction hitting the
ground near it The snake that was approaching you
spins around begins to draw its scimitar 
and it begins to approach
 You put that behind where the serpent was
 Okay You guys arc in the completely
opposite direction heading towards where the base
of this temple is There is another one of those
that is currently at the bottom of the stairway
that is making its way in your direction
 You point at the manticore
 Shes the one who did it
 Make a deception check
 The DCs low on these because youre
disguised
 You had to beat a ten You push and it
turns around and sees the manticore and looks at
you curiously It has to take a moment to decide
which is more dangerous the manticore or this
curious serpent Goes ahead and grabs you by the
chest and begins dragging you with it
 Yeah It cant choose so it just grabs
you
 Okay Well first it has to try and grapple
you so go ahead if you want to fight it
 All right so acrobatics check Natural two
so make an acrobatics or athletics check to try
and break it
 Yeah it grabs you However whats the DC
on the spell
 Natural two again It was like  two All
of a sudden it loses sight and you see its eyes
starting to blink out where once the piercing
yellow snake eyes fade to a snowblind white
 Pulls its blade out and
looks around looking freaked out at the process
You have to break that grapple its still holding
you
 Make another athletics or acrobatics check
Whatre you making
 Yep your choice
 All right
 Well no that was the last time He rolled
a natural eight so hes still holding onto you
Hes blind but hes holding on to you The
scimitars out and hes swinging it wildly at
whatevers in the area now that it cant see and
is 
 Sure Its going to be at a major penalty
 So go ahead and roll
  Okay Go ahead and roll damage
 Okay Ill say thatll give you advantage on
your next check
 It doesnt break the hold
 Okay Natural four

 Falls to the ground and begins chuckling
though in the middle of this chaos it is now
blinded and laughing It releases you
 The manticore is still roaring Creatures
are now flooding out of the city to combat this
and you can see some of them are swinging and are
beginning to notice something strange
 All right so you guys are charging towards
the temple You bypass that one Now youre
heading up the stairs Up across the way theres
one of those crotchety snake people that you saw
patrolling the upper area who has its longbow out
and is currently firing one after another arrow
toward the manticore Its moved off to the side
It doesnt seem to immediately notice your
presence as you approach If you guys are trying
to stealth by without getting its attention I
need you all to make another stealth check now
that youve engaged in combat
 Well hold on Pass Without a Trace is it
concentration
 Because you cast Hold Person since then
 Its okay It is So straight stealth
checks guys
 Okay Hold on
 There we go
 Natural  on his end
 I rolled a natural  on my d
  
 About  feet above you above the stairs
just in the middle of the open Glancing off to
the side the manticore still drawing most of the
attention but people are starting to figure out
the weirdness about it
 Yes you can
 In a whisp of dark shadow energy you see
Fjord just vanishes from sight and teleports right
behind Go ahead and make an athletics check
 Natural four You Sparta this fucker right
off the side of the temple You watch him tumbling
down the entire length of the side of this temple
before landing on the ground and skidding and
looking unconscious and bleeding out of the side
of his mouth at the base of the temple
 Okay
 Hes unconscious
 Technically hes prone because hes on the
ground so it would be at disadvantage Roll one
more time
 That hits roll damage So with the damage
he took from the fall there Oh yeah
 So hes burning and not moving You assume
 Oh youre going stairs up the side It
levels off towards the top of it but you dont
know whats at the top there
 Make a perception check
 Glancing around I mean the manticores
causing a huge ruckus in the middle of the city
and those that have begun to realize that its an
illusion are looking around confusedly and at the
moment do not see you but that time is going to
be very short because youre out in the middle of
the sunlight The trees arent above you now This
is an open clearing in the middle of the jungle
and youre just running up the side of these
temple stairs with the light down upon you from the sky
 Maybe from foot to shoulder
 About four foot
 Yeah Its like a tiny hunched
 Wait the one you just shot
 Hes at the bottom of the temple
 No you guys have been climbing the temple
and he kicked him down off the side of it Its all good
 Right No worries
 Okay So as that idea flashes through your
mind that would be cool but its not going to
work so you keep rushing and we come back to the
moment as you guys dart up the side of the temple
Everyone make one more stealth check now that
youve had that brief encounter and teleported
behind to make sure that nobody catches you before
you reach the top portion
 Stealth yes
 Thats still a pretty high average and its
more of an average thing So a couple of stumbles
coming up the stairs from some of you but largely
you make it cresting to the top of the platform
You get there for a second take a few breaths and
realize glancing over to the side that people are
still emerging looking over the side and you can
see dozens of these snake people are emerging from
the buildings and heading towards the sound of
this raging manticore There are those that are
now scattering from the manticore trying to
engage them to tell them its not what they think
it is There are eyes glancing around and you can
see the sentinels are starting to But you guys
are keeping low and out of sight No one at the
moment seems to notice where you are and the few
that have noticed you youve either taken out or
have lost sight of where you were traveling So
for the moment you feel safe At the top of the
temple you can see some sort of a worship
terrace Theres torchbearing statues of snakes
sitting near the corners of each of these five
sides of the temple similar in shape to the one
that you found the idol In fact at the top of
each of these torches theres a similar golden
idol but while the one you have is smooth each
of these has a carved divot on the inside where
the torch itself is actually burned in Or where
materials are placed in to burn as a torch when
the night comes or for any ceremonial use it requires
 Right now its just an open platform You
do see in the center of it a heavy stone tablet
about foot by sixfoot the rests directly in
the center You can see metal rings that are
bolted in with metal rivets that hold it on the
sides of the tablet The stone itself appears to
be stained with a variety of various shades of
stain
 There was one stone table about foot by
sixfoot and on the sides of it there are rings
that are bolted in and there are stains across the
surface
 Yep
 Yeah you have a good idea
 Well make an arcana check and make a
religion check
 Okay Youre not entirely certain
 You get the sense that this is for
sacrifices but youre not entirely certain to
what ends and to what purpose whether its just
ceremonial or for a specific purpose
 Youre out in the open on the top of this
temple but you do see as youre inspecting the
table and looking around there is a trap door
made of the same color stone that has a handle
built on it that you can pull back
 All right It looks to not be trapped
Though it is locked
  Getting down to this device you can see
its an intricate thick long key what would
have probably been that long and have a whole
series of intricately designed cliffs to it to hit
all of the various
 Tumblers thank you To get this to open
However you manage to get multiple angles and
press and hold and press and hold with all of
your tools It takes everything in your bag to get
through it but you manage to just hit each one
properly and lift and it pulls open with a
grinding sound
 You do hear a smattering of hissing and
growling sounds that are getting louder and louder
 Okay You all dart inside At this point as
you are stepping inside you see on the opposite
end rushing up the edge you see Jamedi go
 Very good and he jumps inside with
the rest of you
 I have not seen her
 I havent
 Make an insight check
 Hard to read
 All right He darts inside the rest of you
guys are inside You close it
 All right As you are just closing it
gently you can see shapes coming up over one and
now a second side of the temple There are a few
charging up All right It locks from the inside
The latch locks behind itself
 Youre now standing in a small fivefoot by
eightfoot chamber You are all cramped in there
but there is a spiral staircase that leads down
 Okay Make an investigation check
 All right There is a faint noise you hear
that goes Do not worry I was waiting for you up
top this entire time
 All right Mage Armor is on Whatd you
roll
 Seems safe
 Okay Notts charging down the stairs the
rest of you follow suit The chamber beneath has
some sort of faint fiery light source and it
opens up below you As you begin to move downward
you can see a pentagramlike chamber Not a
perfect pentagram but there are five sides to it
one thats shorter than the rest that gives this
diamondshape to the interior of the chamber
There are two walls on the sides and there are
bits of green growth in the corners In the
center theres a raised platform with some sort
of fountain that rests in the middle and there
are four figures standing around this fountain
Which is precisely what you notice as Nott your
foot hits one of these steps that  gives
out from underneath and the stairs suddenly shift
into a sliding platform
 Its about a degree angle
 Its only about ten feet  feet down and
what would have stopped you to catch a moment you
all of a sudden 
 Its not going to be a hard fall but any
sense of stealth you wouldve had or any sort of
surprise is gone as all of you manage to barely
glide your way to the bottom or stumble on your
ass sliding to the bottom of this chamber There
in the darkened lit interior chamber three of
these figures standing around this fountain
holding bowls glance over their shoulders towards
you and hiss with sharpened snake teeth
 Behind the fountain you see one jet
blackgray humanoid body Its a little larger
than the others with a giant extended snake head
The cobra hood long and wide on each side Its
eyes glowing red from the back
 And well get to that next week

 Its a slender humanoid body thats tall and
thin but its body is gray scaled and armor plates
and then from its shoulders it extends up into
the hooded cobra head
 Yeah its probably about sevenfoot tall
and the others are about fiveandahalf sixfoot tall
 We got a week

  Thats a tshirt Well thank you
guys Well pick this up next week Im excited
Thank you guys for sticking around with us
tonight Have a good week we love you and is it
Thursday yet Good night

 Welcome back everybody Last we left off
The Mighty Nein had found their way south outside
of the Empire on the coast of the Menagerie Coast
stolen a pirate ship apparently Following a
thread to pursue aspects of the mystery of Fjords
background and the relationship to his mysterious
patron followed a mostly charred map to an island
known as Urukaxl Passing the dangerous reefs you
came upon the mother ship to the ship that you had
stolen known as the Squalleater which was then
you realized helmed by Captain Avantika who gave
you the option of either working with her under
her guise as essentially currently captives and
maybe eventually crewmen of the ship or be killed
and left in the harbor held down with rocks and
die You took her up on the offer You also
discovered that she seems to be as enthralled with
this same entity as Fjord is and has some sort of
similar history with how this serpentine entity
known as
 Ukotoa You remembered Good job
 Ukotoa once a creation of Zehir the
Cloaked Serpent god now banished since the
Calamity This entity then began to build its own
following and the followers of Zehir this old
god this once creator grew jealous and sealed it
away Now Avantika with your help is working to
begin to release these seals bring it back and
as such gain the blessings and boons of this
entity You decided to go into the jungle with her
on this mission alongside an adventurer a
dungeoneer who had plotted out some of the path
for you named Jamedi You had made your way
through avoiding hunting parties of lizard men
being hunted by yuanti snake people You made
your way towards a mostly stonecrafted village in
the center of this island that surrounded one
large old temple You snuck in masquerading as
some of these snake people and mostly succeeded
managed to sneak your way through part of the
town gathering some attention You threw up some
distracting illusions You quickly killed off a
few of them that had begun to grow wise to your
presence not being naturally wanted and in the
midst of the commotion you raced up the steps of
the temple managed to kick one of the sentries
off the side found a way through the top and
closed it off locking behind the very top of this
fivesided pyramid Now once inside you began to
descend slowly down the curved stairs but in
missing a trap that was present triggered it The
stairs went smooth and the entire party slid down
this slide Gooniesstyle before impacting into
the ground of one of the top chambers of the
pyramid Looking within the interior of this
fivesided chamber you noticed amongst the two
pillars to the side a raised platform where there
was a fountain of some kind surrounded by three of
these mostly humanoid but
snakescalecoveredinplaces yuanti people and
one with gray armored scaly skin mostly human
body though tall and lanky and a head that was
purely cobralike The hood exposed as all of them
turn to your direction as you impact with the
stone and are made aware of your presence With
that Mighty Nein I would like for you to roll
initiative

 Yes you will and thatll be your turn
because literally its not so much a stand you
just slid down and hit the ground and you just
take a moment to take in the scenario and then now
we get to be
 No worries
 Good call All righty  to 
 Look at you Did you roll initiative for
Yasha
  to 
  for Fjord  to ten
 All righty Ten to five
 I believe thats all of us Beginning now
this round of combat Beau you have the jump
Everyone is prone by the way You slid down the
stairs on your ass and impacted with the stone
floor of this chamber Nott what would you like
to sorry Beau is sorry Beau
 Yeah these are
 Yes these are the yuanti These three
individuals that are mostly humanoid but bits of
their skin are scaled their eyes are yellow you
can see sharpened teeth This individual here is
the one with the large hooded snake head thats
still a bit taller than the rest and these long
lanky arms Gray skin
 They look very unhappy that youve stumbled
into this chamber
 Beau comes to her feet thats half your
movement
 Its halved that Almost all numbers in the
game are rounded down so to 
 I dont know if you have enough room or
enough distance to get over here Youd have to
go over Either way youre going to take some
attacks of opportunity so its up to you
 You jump onto your feet and leap up onto the
top and youre now pincered from both at
different angles What are you going to do
 Okay go for it
  hits
 Its nine damage
 Thats a natural  plus zero
 It does make the save
 Go for it
  does hit Theyre not wearing much in
armor Theyre here for ceremonial reasons
 Eight points of damage to the other one so
both been hit
 I mean theyre not armored they have
weapons on them These particular ones the
purebloods you see here as they are called are
not wearing heavy armor so theyre not too
difficult to hit
 All right go for it You got two more
attacks then
 Ten points of damage to the one on the
left
 Nice All righty You went whack whack
Manage to hit them both repeatedly in a row All
attacks hit Theyre both taken aback by the
impact and then spin to you immediately their
tongues out Theyre definitely focused on your
presence now
 Now youre done Yashas go next
 All right Yasha gets to her feet
 Correct
 Not right now That path is blocked
unfortunately
 Yeah currently
 Yes The rage kicks in pulls out her
Magicians Judge sword and
 Certainly I mean shes flanked but she
can
 Yeah
 Roll for the attack with advantage because
you have her flanked
  hits so damage on that one

 Nice Jumps off of the side and with the
momentum she leaps onto the platform She pulls
her sword out arcs it past the already punched
damaged yuanti in front Reacts looks over the
shoulder towards you as you go for your second
attack Same one
  points of damage
 Okay then
 On the same one right
 With the second strike the first one
carves past it hisses at her Yasha then spins
the sword around and with one giant snap the head
 and the body falls off to the side of the ground
and crumbles
 Okay Rage winks
 That finishes Yashas go
 That one is going to look towards you Beau
and in this soft pinched voice go Why dont you
just go sit down Make a wisdom saving throw for
me as this brief sparkle happens in your eyes You
feel this wave of arcane influence begin to reach
out towards your mind
 You blink it off and smile back
 The other one is going to moving off to
this end attempt to pull out a scimitar and aim
down to strike at an angle towards Nott whos
currently on the ground
 Yeah she is Shes within melee
 So she gets an attack
 That definitely hits
 Nice Yashas seeing this one slink by and
swing with the scimitar down towards Nott whos
trying to scramble away down on the ground Yasha
turns around and slams the blade into the back of
her shoulder forcing her down However the
scimitar is already arcing down towards Nott with
advantage because you are on the ground All
right a  and a  I believe thats a total of
 to hit
 The strike hits you for seven points of
slashing damage
 Three
 Now the tall lanky gray one begins to take a
step forward and slither around in this direction

  Over the top down The legs as they bend
seem to give in places they shouldnt with an
unnatural slithery feel to even just the
footsteps Its really creepy to watch it move As
it spins around its going to attempt to take a
bite and scimitar attack both on Beau with
advantage because its flanking with its own
pureblood Thatll be a  to hit
 Bite attack so you take four points of
piercing damage plus nine points of poison damage
 As part of its mind fang ability youre
also going to take some psychic damage
 Oh thats not good

  points of psychic damage
 As the hood opens and the giant fangs extend
and sink into the back of your shoulder the
poison hits your system and your brain suddenly
pulses with a sharpening pain The psychic energy
courses through the entirety of your
consciousness For a second your vision goes
flash white and blurs You almost fall to one knee
as the fangs pull out of the wound At that
moment its going to strike with its scimitar
 Thats  to hit
 Seven points of slashing damage
 All right Thats going to end its turn
 All right That brings us to Fjords turn
 To which one
 Okay go for it
 That hits
  still hits
 No As it pulls back from Beau and swings
with its scimitar the head curves back and stares
at you You can see against this dark gray scaly
skin its very dull yellowwhite eyes immediately
trace onto you Is that the end of your turn Are
you going to move or stay where youre at You
have  more feet of movement
   its as far as you can get
 That finishes your go Fjord Nott youre
up
 That definitely hits Its sneak attack
because its adjacent to Beau plus the additional
damage from a fire bolt
 It should be on your sheet there I think
its an additional d fire damage if I recall
 It hisses as the bolt hits it from the back
of the head and you can see where it embedded
itself partially into the skull It comes up at
top and part of the bones piercing up and the
flames are still burning in the back Its trying
to reach and pull it out of its own head All
right thats your action
 It didnt go all the way through the brain
it just hooks into it It did some serious damage still
 Well youre still prone If you want to get
up its half your movement or you can crawl at
half speed
 You crawl over here You can go there
because youre still in melee with that one but
you can attempt to hide from the other if youd
like
 Its advantage on melee attacks against you
disadvantage on ranged attacks against you You
crawl on the ground around the corner Roll a
stealth check
 Yeah you always get advantage while you
have that cloak on
 You believe maybe youve hidden from that
one particular creature That finishes Notts go
Breaking the silence here Beau after youve been
struck by this terrible psychic pain in your face
and the poison courses through your veins you
look before you and the one yuanti pureblood in
front of you you had already damaged is
 and its pulling this crooked dagger
out of this sheath from the side Suddenly in a
flash out of nowhere behind you see blades go
 and you watch as Avantika who was
previously invisible still from the spell appears
as she does three main strikes from behind
 Thatll do it Eviscerates it from behind
 Falls to the ground Avantika is there
in front of you and flicks both blades off Some
of the blood  across the stone on the
ground Dont worry Ive got you and is going
to use movement to move up this way Actually she
doesnt have enough movement to do that She can
be right there and gets one more space there That
ends Avantikas go
 One more point Thank you for the
clarification on your math there Sam Jamedis
going to get up
 Makes me sad Good patience on that one
Jamedis going to start taking the bow and huffing
and running around the way to hide behind this
pillar Coming that way is going to attempt to
fire a short bow at the one thats right next to
Yasha Natural  very nice
 That is six points of damage to that
yuanti and is going then continue to move
actually no at that point he couldnt quite get
that far He would have been right there Trying
to move behind but because he had to get up from
prone lost half of his movement That ends his
go That brings us to Jester
 Jester you stand up
 On the gray guy Okay you release the
spell and it has no effect It seems that the
snakelike form that this creature has mutated into
has gotten so far out of the realm of humanity to
no longer be considered a person
 Thats your action
 All right  towards you its fangs
bared That ends your go Jester Caleb and
Caduceus you guys are up at the same time
 Ooh All righty Roll for attack
 Thatll hit
 Nice
 You are yes
 Over here
   As you rush by its snake
head cranes around and extends out to bite towards
the side of your shoulder and arm as you rush
past
 If its during your turn I believe you
cannot because you only cast one spell
 Its different from combat spells versus
casting spells during one turn Ill have to go
back and look at that specifically But for the
time being no because theres the one spell per
round limitation during your turn at least That
is going to be all together a  to hit
 With that the bite strikes out for you
That is six points of piercing damage plus seven
points of poison damage Its going to use its
secondary mind fangs this round Similar to Beau
your brain suddenly gets spiked with this burst of
terrible wracking pain that emanates into every
memory of your past life Like your existence in
one instant is just set on fire and pulled away
 Oh thats not too bad Thats  points of
psychic damage to you
 That ends your turn then
 Technically you would have gotten that far
Thats halfspeed That ends your turn Caduceus
youre up
 Stand up
 There You back in towards this cluster of
weird mossy plant matter thats on the edge
 Caduceus What are you doing buddy
 There you go take your eight points of
healing
 Okay That ends Caduceus turn Beau youre
up Yashas go is when you release
 Okay
  hits
 Stunning Strike on this one That is a 
 Resists it unfortunately Theres a
 as you hit You realize as youre trying
to do Stunning Strike you dont fully understand
the physicality of it Its body and organ
placement is different from the usual other
humantype creatures youve studied and so youre
just unable to hit the right point in its body
 In your confusion and frustration of not
being able to find the soft spot in its body your
second strike goes and it manages to dodge out of
the way No impact
 All right so then you go in Patient Defense
to protect yourself Got it
 That is now Yashas turn Before Yasha can
begin the round Caduceus
 Okay So the next hit against it it has
vulnerability
 Correct All right
 Whats Yasha doing
 Right there
 As Yasha darts off the pureblood behind
manages to swipe out with the scimitar Has an
attack of opportunity against her That is going
to be a natural Theyre rolling really good 
plus three 
 With that Yasha suffers seven six on the
d Seven points of slashing damage reduced to
three because shes raging
 Then Yasha shrugs off the impact rushes
towards the large gray snake entity and
 Go for it
 That is correct Go ahead and roll damage on
that one
 Okay  points of damage It is vulnerable
against that That is technically  points of
damage from that strike How does Yasha want to do
this
 As the blade impales it the creature grabs
the blade with both hands and  as its
lifted up and begins cursing  Hold on
Pay attention guys
 Its okay As the blade carves through the
stomach of the gray snake man and is lifted off
the ground  It begins to curse in
Abyssal as the blade begins to carve up its body
until eventually its hissing turns into a low
gurgle and then it just slides off the blade the
parted half of it splitting into two sides onto
the ground
 Yes
 All right
 This one is going to seeing how everything
is working out Yeah Does not have that ability
so is instead going to go ahead and  
Then try and dash
 Oh no Thats true Given that circumstance
theres not much of an escape route for this one
 Is going to instead leap down and attempt
to assail Nott
 Not against that one youre not All right
so attacks twice with the scimitar Ooh natural
 on that one and a
 No because when you hold your action you
use your reaction to release it so you dont have
a reaction
 Sorry buddy Thats a natural  on one
scimitar hit and a  on the other to hit The
first one thats eight plus one Nine points of
slashing damage on the first hit
 Thats four slashing damage and the second
one is going to be Ooh thats not good Two
points of slashing damage
 Now with all of its allies fallen around and
seeing everyone else standing up its eyes are
darting around looking like its a caged animal
 Its scimitar in front of
it its swinging it wildly in the air and
pointing it towards anything that comes near Thats
going to end their turn Fjord youre up next
 Make an intimidation check
 Glaring at you doing that 
 Doesnt seem to be fazed unfortunately
 As it snarls at you you pull the blade a
little closer to the face up against the chin
 and throws the scimitar to the
side

 I was surprised I was like
 Okay That
brings us effectively out of combat
 At this point you all take stock of your
surroundings The one standing yuanti the bowls
they were holding and pouring into this fountain
clattered to the ground the one stands there
before you with your blade held towards their neck
as theyre 
 Well that would be more generally looking
around you guys In this chamber based on the
little bit of travel youve done from the very top
of this temple this is the top chamber in the
pyramid Youre about partway down from where it
is on the surface It continues down you imagine
based on how large it is in size This is the
highest part of the pyramid so far Within this
chamber there are clusters of these bits of mossy
plant life thats growing in elements of the
corners There is a fountain that sits atop the
central platform in the center of the chamber The
water itself is slowly trickling off the sides in
small little grooves it looks to be brackish and
green The staircase a few minutes pass revert
to stairs so ascension is possible Thats the
most of what you can make out in the chamber The
pillars appear to be more loadbearing and
designed as you get a closer look make a
perception check on this one
 Interesting point The stonework and
the construct of this entire temple is very old
and very simple but you see a lot of intricate
carvings and additional stone thats been added to
the interior of the chamber that is all carved to
represent snake creatures surmounting and a great
snake god Make a religion check
 A lot of the iconography in
this chamber is directly based on Zehir the
Cloaked Serpent and is imbuing their power into
the snake followers and giving them mutations You
can see people going into this metamorphosis and
transforming into a number of the larger snake
entities you fought or have seen in the city
below But all that carving is newer Its
fresher Its been placed to cover the older stone
of the temple and you get the sense that this
temple was not constructed by these yuanti but
has been since coopted by them
 Looking you over It was shes speaking in 
Common now It was built to a false idol
 The eyes turn towards
you looking up at your large goofy grin
 With that parts of their wounds
begin to split open wider as you see bits of
reddishorange fungus begin to find its way out
It looks like a sponge emerging from it
 She turns to you and goes Are 
you to let me live
 Make a persuasion check
 Looks towards you looks towards
Caduceus Goes I will not sully myself before
the eyes of my god In a flash pulls a dagger
from inside the sash attached to the side and
spray cuts her own throat scattering across the
front of you Caduceus before the body plummets
back onto the ground with a sick thud on the
stonework and then bleeds out a small grin
pulling across her sharpened teeth before her eyes
roll back and she expires
 Make a dexterity check
 The moment of shock hits you having
not encountered someone take their life right in
front of your eyes and that brief moment of pause
is enough that when you go to try and collect your
thoughts and cast the spell the spirits already
left the body
 I would say you go to cast the spell
 You begin to and then realize theyve
already expired
 Those are some of the inscripted carvings
that were placed over the existing stonework of
the chamber
 Okay Make an investigation check as youre
searching the fountain
 Thats not too bad Stepping up onto the
outside of this fountain its a twotiered
fountain Along the floor of the fountain basin
within the water on the base there are two
reliefs of snakes coiled sitting underneath the
water with empty eye sockets Two of them one of
them has empty eyes the other one has an empty
eye socket and a dull gray eye that still remains
The liquid looks grimy and cloudy
 You do notice there are on four edges of
the bottom basin at the lip of the water and the
water meets the very edge there are slight
grooves where the waters slowly trickling out and
down to the floor and where it hits the floor
there is no pool of water You inspect closer and
there is a hole beneath each groove where the
water itself is pouring through the floor below
you to what you assume to be a chamber below
 Make an arcana check to see if you can
ascertain any arcane nature to it
 You guys are all taking a short rest
 Beau you do notice the corner where the
moss is as you cuddle up to it and glance
forward there is a sixinch or so diameter hole
in the corner of the wall
 Goristro need a way out too
 Where the moss is growing there is a hole
in the stone chamber about that big around that
looks to be a tunnel or tube that slowly descends
downward
 Upon glancing at it the interior is somewhat damp
with condensation and thats where a lot of this
moss is gathering around the outskirts of it You
also notice scales little clusters of scales that
are gathered on the edges of the stone
 Yeah Make a perception check
 You glance up on the ceiling and you can see
two grooves well not two grooves but two holes
that are in the stonework above Bits of the stone
have fallen and cracked a little Where those two
holes are glancing directly below them looking
up you can see the faint pinhole bits of light
from the sky above You also see the stone right
around those holes is faintly stained crimson
 Make a medicine check
 With your experience with blood and the
viscosity of it you gather that if any of it were
to find its way into the fountain either its not human
crimson color enough You dont see any signs of
it currently in here Most of the water thats in
this fountain right now seems to be just water and
algae and grime that has built up within the
fountain
 Approximately
 Sure Make an investigation check
 Yes You inspect the body of the now
slaughtered cobra figure It is nude Theres no
clothing on it it is a scaled flesh body
 No no armor it is just a lanky heavily
scalearmored snake creature Theres nothing to
pull off of its body unfortunately
 Okay Do you have the materials to do so
 Have you ever milked a dead snake for its
venom
 Make a nature check for me
 Okay youll spend the next  or  minutes
or so attempting to do this and Ill come to you
in a minute with your success andor failure
 You go around finding each of these patches
Yes there are At each corner of the chamber
there are these patches and at each corner you do
see one of these holes Make a perception check
 All you can tell is that you do see the
errant scale Theyre big scales theyre not
tiny You see bits of snake skin and larger chunks
of scales that have rubbed off from something
moving through that chamber
 Yeah from side to side diameter
 Oh through the hole Okay
 It does echo slightly down and you hear it
reverberate It does continue downward
 Nott what were you doing
 With an  it does not appear to be
trapped
 Whatever stone has been placed has been
cemented in with all sorts of adhesive and basic
masonry materials It was designed to permanently
cover what was there previously
 If you guys want to take a short rest you
can do it At the moment it does not appear that
theres any immediate danger The door locked
above you and you dont hear any more scuffling
from above
 Are you talking about the holes in the
corner
They are about that big around just so you
know
 Yeah you could put a sword in there It
would be sitting on the ground and blocking the
space a bit
 Youre taking the corpses and filling
 Okay
 Okay
 To which one one of the purebloods
 Make a perception check
 Okay As youre dragging it over you do see
a bit of metal jewelry fall out from underneath
the robe
 It is an intricate stone key that is on a
metal chain
 Investigation check
 Across the other two bodies you find that
was the only key You do find amongst the two of
them some errant pieces of jewelry You find a
nice gold ring Youre not quite sure how much
its worth but it looks probably worth something
You find two jeweled daggers ceremonial that
they had kept sheathed or one of them had brought
out earlier Thats what you find on their bodies
 Both of these blades have very simple
snakelike iconography Where the pommel is it
looks like the snout of a snake mouth
 The ring No the ring is a simple gold
ring
 Well for you its taken the full hour If
everyones taking a short rest its a full hour
of rest
 No While youre all resting too Jamedi is
carefully looking through the different holes in
the side of the chambers and helping you plug them
with some of the dead bodies As you push them in
Avantika saunters up to you Fjord and says So
How long has it been for you eh
 Since youve been called
 Well say for this purpose you guys are
out of earshot of most of the group
 Then it was destiny What happened Tell me
everything
 I am familiar with this promise aye
 Glancing at her expression shes enthralled
and theres a moment where her head turns and you
see a flash of jealousy in her eyes and then it
reverts back and she goes That sounds incredible
 A few years about
 Apparently Her eyes are still locked on
yours and she leans forward and takes her fingers
and puts them through the side of your hair and
goes I can trust you right
 And you trust these people
 Good Good She puts her fingers the rest
of the way through your hair through the back of
your head pulls you close and headbutts you a
little bit and lets you go and gets up and walks off
 Jester
 Your short rest comes to a close Youve
used your hit dice youve healed up a bit youve
gotten your arcane
 Cool What would you guys like to do
 Make an investigation check
 Best you can tell they were carved onto a
separate piece of stone that has since been
affixed to the previous backing of this chamber
Its been that way across most of the walls here
 Youre shouting into a dead body stuffed
into a hole
 You dont see any language carved in here
Its mostly visuals of Zehir the Cloaked Serpent
bestowing the blessing and mutating followers that
are rising up His army of snake people
 There are the holes in the ground at the
base of the fountain where the waters is actually
trickling through to something beneath Theres
the curled snakes that are in the water below
Those are the only things that youve noticed
around the fountain
 Make a medicine check
 Nice Looking her over you can see the dark
circles under the eyes the continuous sweating
along the brow and the shoulders and the chest
area
 The pupils are slightly dilated and the
breathing is more shallow than normal
 Definitely warmer to the touch than a
healthy person would be Theres some sort of a
disease thats working her way through her system
You dont have a whole bunch of book experience
with disease necessarily but you get the sense
that this might have been transmitted by some of
the insects that you encountered on the island on
your way in Its some sort of disease transmitted
by them through bites
 Thats true It says condition be blinded
deafened paralyzed or poisoned and then above it
says diseased and I did not read that part
earlier
 As part of my own mistake here well say
that this is where you come through with your
casting of Lesser Restoration before
 Yeah Exactly It takes a while for it to
work its way through the system
 Thats what I get for fast reading Going
Oh well it doesnt list that among the
conditions but disease is not a condition Thats
my fault
 Hes sitting there
 Hes inspecting the side of the walls and
the carvings
 I am okay but I appreciate the offer
 I do on occasion yes
 He turns back towards you with a curious
glance and says
 Im sober
 His eyes narrow Yes I would love some
jerky
 He takes it from you I appreciate the
offer He eats and continues to look over
 Make a perception check
 Looks like it You see him chewing Chewing
A little swallow Chew chew chew
 Chewsing
 Sure You take your paintbrush and as you
put it in there because there is the groove on
the side of the fountain and it meets with the
hole in the ground so the water is going through
the hole below You stick your paintbrush in it
and it mixes with the paintbrush Its thicker
than water barely Its faintly viscous and where
the groove is you can see the greenish slick where
slime and general algae buildup has caused it to
discolor against the rest of the stone It builds
up a bit and you pull the paintbrush out and it
continues down into the chamber below
 It smells like a typical type of algae
though the liquid itself has a somewhat acrid
smell to it
 No the blood of the yuanti that youve
seen as it scatters is a deep purple in color
 Correct
 Correct
 Oh yeah thats right You did not
unfortunately As you try and sit there holding
the head over a jar and jamming the fang into the
thing this awkward process you dont get much
out of it unfortunately
 I will say you do recall as when you entered
the temple now that youre thinking about it
that the door that locked behind you above you
the trap door it had a small opening where a
 You complete your ritual The ring is not
magical but it is worth a fair amount of gold
 You swirl the paintbrush in the fountain for
a bit It collects some of the brackish liquid
 Hes turned around Hes still chewing the
jerky He puts his shortbow over his shoulder and
gathers his things Hes loaded up with pouches
and sacks Hes not designed to be a combatant
hes designed to be a traveler
 I am not a religious man but I appreciate
your sense of inclusion
 He looks over at the dead serpent people
jammed into holes

 So it would seem
 Jamedi has dark brown skin smooth bald
head gaunt features Hes wearing light cloth
billowing sleeves but its tied with a bracer to
each side so it doesnt get in the way of his
hands movement A few pack and satchels around
him He looks like what youd imagine a
professional dungeoneer would look like where he
has a few things to defend himself but hes not a
combatant by any means Hes very good about
getting in and out of places quickly unseen and
gather as much information as he can
 Correct
 There were three of them One of them is
missing two eyes the other is missing one and had
another gray rock in there
 What you know about Zehir
 Zehir is a god
that wanders in shadow is the creator of snakes
and serpent kin It is essentially the evil god of
poisons assassins and darkness They believe that
to keep your acts obfuscated and secret is the
greatest means of success Strike quickly and
without reason Blind the target with their own
confusion and Kill slowly Agonizingly Or
worse make them enjoy it are some of the tenets
of their religion and belief
 You reach into the water and place
 Using Mage Hand into the water it finds its
way in Seems to wedge into and affix Mage Hand
again into a second one On one side the
grimecovered snake thats coiled up there now has
two glittering ruby eyes peering out unnaturally
versus the rest of its relatively bland dark
graygreen body You take it and place it in the
opposing socket As soon as it slicks into place
you all hear this grinding of stone The fountain
shifts and begins to slowly spiral down below As
it begins to move downward beneath it begins to
show the about two feet of stone of the floor that
youre standing on eventually gives way to the
roof of a chamber below you Lightless it is
pitch black below
 Youre still standing on the outside of the
fountain looking down in Only just the outskirts
of the fountain went down in this slow spiral You
glance downward It stops about ten feet below
you It comes to a stop Theres a bit of a
tenfoot drop to where the fountain is and now
below where it was standing theres about two
feet of smooth pillar and then very thin stairs
that continue to spiral down Those of you with
darkvision since there was no light source in
here you can see in pitch black of dim light
within  feet The chamber itself goes just
beyond that so you cannot see the floor of the
its a fresh earth and vegetation mixed with a
smell of fermentation and rot It seems that below
in this chamber there is a small orchard of some
kind that exists without sunlight
 What do you do
 Okay 
 Make a perception check
 Absolutely silent
 As you guys glance down these small orbs
begin to illuminate the base on the floor The
pillar drops down about  feet The chamber is
about foot from floor to ceiling You have
about ten feet before you hit the actual staircase
down but its a thin staircase Each step is
maybe about seven or so inches wide
 You guys look over and see this as well the
orbs float down and light the area It is a thick
mass of jungle vines and roots and damp earth
that hits the floor You can see a lot of these
similar trees Its just this singular type of
tree that is just repeatedly planted throughout
the area You can see these slightly green to
yellowcolored fruit that are bared by these
various trees a lot of which have fallen and are
beginning to ferment on the ground and rot Thats
where you get the smell that hit you originally
Some of them that have fallen begin to just slowly
rot away and decompose into the floor of this
orchard
 About  feet from where you are About 
feet once you hit the stairs
 Okay make an acrobatics check for me
 Easy enough to do Even the slick spots and
as it ground its way down smeared some of the
algae along the outside which caused a faint bit
of slickness on outside of the pillar Using that
without an issue slide land on the top step It
holds your weight
 You got it
 For investigation to see if there are any
traps on the way down No traps It is a simple
descent and as soon as you hit the soft floor of
the orchard its just natural ground around you
in the immediate vicinity
 Yeah two that are within a foot of where
you stand Theyre somewhat beginning to ferment
 Yeah The interior is a bright orangeyellow
color It looks fleshy like the inside of a
mango It smells sweet but it has that turning
point where its starting to get a little bit
 Yeah
 It tastes sweet and tangy
 Okay You nibble a little bit It tastes
pretty good Its got that tang to it that irony
tang aftertaste to it
 Okay you eat it What are you guys doing
 Its just fun to fuck with you guys
 Make an acrobatics check
 You catch yourself there but keep yourself
up and begin to descend down the steps and below
 Okay Beau acrobatics check
 You hit it and your foot hits a slick spot
You catch yourself and hold onto the edge adjust
and then continue down without issue
 Ten Unfortunately theres not a whole lot
of handhold in this area Its a smooth tenfoot
space and as you try to find a handhold to grab
onto you just fall straight down
 On how many
 Thats awesome Thats slick
 Yeah I was going to say
 theyre not
falling As soon as he slips in
 Okay do you take it Do you guys
 As Caleb sees this happening
 shoves
 The four of you fall and begin to slowly
drift
 You all land gently on the tips of your toes
before the rest of your body finds its weight now
resting onto the soft floor of the subterranean
orchard
 Nott about a minutes past since youve
eaten that fruit and you start feeling a little
tingly on the inside of your body
 You turn to look at Caleb and its crazy
His hairs purple now its pink now its orange
now its purple
 His pupils are purely dilated
 As youre glancing around the light orbs
that are slowly drifting theyre leaving trails behind
 Make a perception check
 With disadvantage because you
 Six okay
 At this point Jamedi and Avantika have
managed to join you below in the chamber
 Hello
 Jamedi he pulls out a torch and lights it
up Its very bright
 Everyone turns slowly to Nott
 As the faint orbs are met with the brighter
torchlight from Jamedi it opens up the chamber
 This entire chamber is roughly ish feet
by about  feet in size This orchard these
trees are everywhere
 No this chamber is foursided actually It
seems make an intelligence check actually
 Based on the shape of the temple as you saw
it the size of the chamber you were just in and
the chamber below there should be more space on
the sides and the front of it It looks like this
is probably a central chamber of this floor
 Make a perception check with disadvantage
Well with advantage because you have the
torchlight on Or no sorry regular roll Brain
working Its been a week
 Yeah nothing
 Seems receptive
 Jamedi looks around I did not go this far
into the temple I returned for your aid so no
 It is very possible I didnt spend too
much time studying the inner workings of their
daytoday I was more focused on surviving
Avantikas looking around arms crossed glancing
keeping her hands near her weapons
 Its not a massive amount of it but each
tree is in the process maybe holding about a few dozen
 No not this stunted Theyre squat trunk
and the top doesnt reach the very top of this
chamber Theyre about five or so feet below
Theyre not massive trees by any means but the
idea of trees like this and as you look at it
now the color previously you had just the
faint light Looking across the ground as you look
up towards the leaves in these trees the
colorations not green necessarily Its more of
a deep purplish brown color to the leaves
 Currently it looks to be soft earth and
where are the roots and various vines that have
entwined their way around from other plant life
that have been subsisting off of the ecosystem
thats built in this space
 You can certainly go check Make an
investigation check
 Your vision is jittery there Nott
 Okay Glancing about the same source The
 In thinking of those questions the ground
itself is damper around the base of the fountain
 Yeah
 You could say its comparable in some ways
It goes from a brown to a faint purpleish tint
 You dont see any signs of animals You
dont see bits of droppings or claw marks or teeth
marks on any of the nearby trees at all
 Youre looking for
 Investigation check because at an immediate
glance you dont see Theres no open archway or anything
 As you two begin to make a perimeter you
dont see any doorways What you do see are on the
south wall the western wall and the northern
wall there are large stone tablets that are
affixed to the wall Similar to the ones you saw
above that have almost mirroring inscriptions of
this same vision of Zehir bestowing these
mutations upon the followers On the bottom of
each of these tablets there is a hole thats about
 inches wide and about five or six inches tall
 Theres no door that you can tell but you
see these large stone tablets that are affixed to
the north western and south wall Each of these
tablets is about maybe eight feet wide ten feet
tall and the base of it right before where it
meets the floor there is a little space A little
hole if you will thats about  inches wide
and about  inches tall
 Its rectangular You also see amongst the
ground as your walking your foot hits something
and you look down and you can see a wicker basket
An empty wicker basket thats overturned
 No
 As these globes of light are brought over to
see it its quite beautiful but before you even
see the relief in the wall theres this extremely
bright series of symbols glowing on the stone in
front of you
 They look like that
 Another set of symbols Say it What is it
 No Its been more than an hour
 Make a perception check
 Okay
 Make a survival check
 Okay
 You can see some grooves in the damp dirt
and areas where the soft bits of leaves that are
fallen that are pressed down but the grooves are
pushed through pressure
 No not necessarily
 That works too Attempting to sketch these
over Im going to say make an intelligence check
with disadvantage please Nott
 Yes
 You do what you think is a decent job trying
to copy what you see It takes a little while
 Okay looking at the spell here
 It doesnt do anything because you cannot
see the language You have to be able to touch it
and see it to read it
 Right You see no language
 Youre figuring this out now as you go to
the wall
 Thats okay As you go to the wall theres
nothing there Youre like Theres no language there
  Caleb eats the fruit
 That would have been probably decent enough
to get through that message Over the next minute
or so Caleb the colors of the lights begin to
shift You guys watch as Caleb begins to slowly
move the floating orbs in different patterns Gets
distracted by his own cantrip
 Caleb make a perception check
 Actually it would be with disadvantage
because of the effect of the
 Glancing about the interior of the chamber
you look in the directions where Nott was and you
can see the three markers and you see a faint
fourth glow from the eastern wall
 Jamedi is holding the torch as a light
source for those who need it Avantika is
grinning watching this whole thing
 As youre walking by Avantika saunters up
to you Fjord and goes like I can certainly
say this is the most entertaining bunch Ive
traveled with in some time
 Oh of course We wouldnt be this far if
they werent
 You head to the southern wall
 He cast Comprehend Languages
 Correct
 South
 Which one do you go to
 Western one
 Avantika just looks straight to you and
goes The false serpent
 We are close
 What do you wish to do
 Theres a strange moment as Nott this
cold sensation on your back Youre like Oh
that kind of tickles It begins to constrict and
you guys glance over and one of the vines is
curled up around Nott and begins to tighten around
it
 You take  points of bludgeoning damage and
are grappled
 You are restrained
 All right
 Go for it Yasha goes in takes two swings
 You got it You hold him up at which point a
vine wraps up around your body Jester That is a
 to hit
 You kick it off and pull away You can now
see this
 This thick vine that is rising up and it
curls around snakelike in its own right towards
you Other vines begin to thicken in the area
around you and the roots begin to turn the area
into hard terrain to walk through The floor of
the forest seems to briefly come alive and you now
see these large two thick entangling vines one
thats wrapped entirely around Nott and
constricting her tiny body The other one trying
to wrap its way around Jester
 Both hit Roll damage
  points of damage on the second one You
can now see as this is happening Who wants to
take action on this one
 No Notts still being constricted
 Yeah No
 Carved into and cut elements of it You can
see the vine itself where its split open
theres a hardy thick light green tendonlike
material beneath Its a very strong vine Its
wrapped around multiple times around Nott now and
its pulling and trying to squeeze her to death
 You can either attempt to help her escape or
you can attempt to punch the vine The choice is yours
 All right This is your action
 Make an athletics check
 Nine Unfortunately its too strong and as
you try and pull the vines away they just are
locked in this death grip around Nott That ends
your action Caduceus
 Its fairly damp Its not super moist but
there is a general hint of humidity in the air
 While this is happening Nott what are you
doing
 No
 Youre just focusing Action spent willing
yourself somewhere else Make a constitution
saving throw
  All right You dont pop a blood vessel
in your eye but it gets close
 You can
 Okay You manage to disperse a lot of the
moisture in the air but you cannot pull it from a creature
 You would know that with the spell
 All right It fails its save Roll damage
Caleb what are you doing Youre being held up by
Jester right now
 Now giant Jester is holding Caleb over your
shoulder
  points of damage All right
 That ends your go Caleb casts Enlarge on
giant Jester Fjord what are you doing
 Yeah
 Sure You grab it and pick it up and look at
it It looks like on the inside it had some
elements of remnants of fruit that may have
scuffed part of the wicker but other than that it
just looks like a basket
 Well youll get to that next round because
it takes your action to lift up the basket and
inspect it
 Thats okay That ends your turn Now the
vines The one that constricts once again to you
Nott As its pulling you in you feel now these
thorns emerge from the inside of its constriction
and poison bursts into your system You take
  points of poison damage
 Yes Your action was lifting Caleb up off
the ground
 The other one will attempt to constrict you
again That is a  to hit
 With that you kick it off with your giant
foot The vine pulls itself back up Now you can go
 Whats the DC on that
 Three and  They both fail Roll d
damage and they both take it
 Youre close enough to the vine that is
trying to attack you yeah
  points of radiant damage to each The
vine that was constricting around you hadnt taken
any damage yet You see a burst of radiant energy
You watch as it lights up the area briefly The
one thats currently burning around there the
radiant damage burns past You can see part of it
blacken from the impact of the radiant energy but
its still holding Nott tight That ends your go
Yasha Whats Yasha doing
 Go for it
 That hits
 Both hit Roll damage Still tearing into
that same vine thats holding Nott
 Correct Damage on the second strike d
plus five Weirdly cocked
  points of damage Hacking through that
vine Its still holding Nott but it is looking
really rough Its on the edge of keeping itself
held together and you can see the parts of where
Yashas carved through and where the radiant
energy has blasted it Its starting to leak this
thick green sap Its having a hard time
 Yeah its a plant bleeding If youve ever
seen a plant bleed
 There you go Beau
 Yeah Notts still stuck Though the vine
around Nott is hurt pretty bad
 Go for it The one thats around Nott or the
one thats after Jester
 The one thats around Nott or the one thats
after Jester
 Okay go for it
 That hits
 Ten points of damage All righty
  misses You swing the second hit with the
staff and as you do the vine arcs out of the way
and it hits air
  just hits
 At this point I also need you to make a
strength saving throw
 Yep
 Now that youve moved in the vines in the
area begin to entangle and move around
 You manage to push off of the vines on the
ground around you that are trying to entangle and
hold your legs to the ground Jester I need you
to also make a strength saving throw
 Yes
 No issue You just kick out of the vines
without problem
 That brings us to Nott On the top of your
turn as you are still constricted you take
another  points of poison damage
 Nott goes unconscious and you watch the
vines closing entirely around her face and torso
just the arm poking out of the side You can now
see as the lighter green skin tone get darker with
blood now being pushed towards the outer sides of
her limbs At end of your turn Nott I need you
to make a death saving throw
 Thats a success All right Caduceus
 Youre going to attempt to
 Okay What are you saying
 Make an intimidation check
 Mmhmm
 Oh buddy
 Okay there you go You no longer have to
roll death saving throws
 It can still constrict you but All
right so that ends your turn Unfortunately your
cries fall on deaf ears as it appears the hunger
that drives these vines overrides the
communication youre attempting to spring with
them That opportunity may have worked but not
this time
 All right finishing your go Now 
 Thats right Jester and well no you
cast Spirit Guardians this turn right Last turn
 I know Im trying to keep in my head
here
 She did She lifted up Caleb the first time
the second time you cast Spirit Guardians Now
were going to Caleb and Fjord Fjord what are
you doing
 There you go Dancing and spearing with
their little horns
 All right Roll a strength saving throw to
see if you can manage to break through the
entangling vines to get towards it
 You feel them pull at your shins but you
still kick through and you hear them snap as you
manage to brush past their grip making your way
towards which one the one that has Nott
 Go ahead and make your first attack
 Its present
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
 Five points of damage You carve through the
vine Bisecting it You watch as now looking as
you get close up you can see the base of it now
This slowly shambling chunk of rooted plant As
you run forward your blade arcing through the
air you cut through the base of it The actual
vine falls limp and uncurls Notts body falling
to the ground unconscious That vine is destroyed
 You still have another attack and theres
the other vine still trying to wrap around Jester
 All right you move up to strike that one
 Nine misses unfortunately
 All right that finishes your go Caleb
 Correct
 Correct on your turn or their turn
 Their turns coming up They forgot to keep
that up last time
 Okay
 Bolt Okay I was like All right
  to hit that definitely hits
 Basically
 It should be howd you get a one if its
d
 At level five youre
 Three damage to it That ends Calebs go
 All right Now both of them are going to
attempt the ones dead the other one fails its
save so go ahead and roll that one
  damage nice Its going to go ahead and
attempt its now moving away from you and moving
over towards Fjord That is going to roll a  to
hit
 It hits you It  wraps around
Fjord pulls your arms to the side of your body
and constricts you You immediately take nine
points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled
and restrained
 All right that finishes that ones go That
brings us to now Avantika kicks in Avantika
pulls out blades and is going to go ahead and
attack the one going after you and goes Hands off
of him Hits with both and then natural  on
the dagger
 Avantika just starts eviscerating this vine
with two slaps of the rapier and then one giant
dagger strike that carves up the side Looking
pretty hurt Still holding on though That being
the case were going to be back at the top That
brings us to Yasha whos next
 Ashleys going to be real happy
 Nah it misses
 Oh there we go
 No for the first hit The first hit that
hits gets the Divine Fury
 You double the dice on that one
  points of damage As Yasha just carves
through the second strike cutting straight up the
side almost freeing you its shredded and still
holding on by a thread of its life as its trying
to pull you back to wherever it crawled its way
out of but still standing That finishes Yashas
go Jester
 Its barely holding on
 All right It fails with a four on its
wisdom save there Go ahead and roll damage
 Five points of damage how do you want to do
this Jester

 Okay the giant Jester stomping out the vine
on the ground its now like  Parts
of it are being crushed and turned to pulp
 Caleb is firemans carry
 Make a perception check
 Jamedis still holding the torch up to give
you a good range of light
 Looking around you you can see where the
two clusters of these weird vine creatures were
these assassintype vines You see theres just
two of them and glancing about the chamber and
giving a good solid look you dont see any more
of that type It looks like these two were the
ones that were rooted here either as protector or
had just woven their way down here and became part
of the ecosystem But at the moment you dont see
any other threat
 All right
 Both Fjord and Caleb  onto the
ground tumbling onto your sides
 They both very much are You have no idea
how long this is going to last
 The only other thing youve seen are the
central slips the holes in the bottom of those
three tablets
 As you make your way towards some of those
doors were going to take a little break

 I just realized were past nine oclock
Take a break here well be back here in a short
bit to pick up their investigation as to where the
next exit point of this chamber may be In the

Happy Halloween
 So Where we left off Mighty Nein You
began to go and inspect some of these tablets with
these gaps beneath the bottom Which way did you
want to go
 Theyre about  to  inches wide and
about four to five inches tall Or on the bottom
 All right There is no tablet or hole in the
east
 Okay Into the south Whos doing what Are
you looking through it
 All right Make a perception check Are you
doing it with a light source below
 Perception check
 Glancing inside you see a hatchery of some
kind Theres a strong smell of fermentation in
there A majority of the room seems to be a series
of clusters of roughly one foot tall eggs Theyve
all been placed in various edges there nestled in
soft dirt and molding fruit
 This is the south room right
 You also see what appears to be a broken
humanoid corpse long decomposed jammed by one of
the clusters
 No no manacles
 You can look around you Go ahead and make a
perception check
 Well there are a number of eggs inside
there
 They look to be somewhat reptilian yeah
 I mean its hard to tell from this
distance All you see is the eggs and the body there
 They start about four feet into the room
and the room itself from what you can see down
there is enclosed
 Go for it
 You do see in some of the walls about two
feet off the ground similar sized holes that are
pushed in against where some of the vines and some
of the carvings are that curl upward you imagine
probably meeting with some of the holes above You
get the sense that perhaps something uses these to
traverse up and down parts of this temple
 You head to the west one and you go ahead
and look inside I imagine putting the spheres in
as well Make a perception check
 Glancing inside its a relatively simple
chamber From what you can tell there are
elements of stonework placed in but they havent
been carved and they are only partially done
Theyve gotten most of the temple finished and
they havent quite fully completed their work in
going over the walls inside The small chamber is
maybe  by ten feet and while theres no other
real discerning shapes or details to it you do
see about ten feet ahead of you It descends into
stairs Tenfoot wide set of stairs
 Okay Make another perception check
please
 This looks to be a sister hatchery room to
the one on the south This one does not contain a
body but just other clusters of eggs
 Make a nature check
 With what experience you have with seeing
much smaller snakes and other type creatures in
nature youre not really fully understanding the
gestation period of yuanti These eggs dont look
like theyre ready to hatch in the next few days
or so Theres still some time before the oldest
clutches of
 Yeah Id say so
 Its the same fiveinch tall   inches
wide space
 Make an investigation check
 You have no idea
 Sure Make a strength check
 Its wide enough The actual stone tablets
are maybe about three and a half four inches
long You can get your fingers through and pull on
the other side but it does not budge At all
 Make an investigation check
 Okay It doesnt separate at all but you do
see each of the tablets Where theyre part of the
wall theyre actually recessed in as opposed to
placed against it You can see a very very faint
gap where they would probably slide either side to
side based on some mechanism
  Which one are you going in
 Its the western one
 All right Make an acrobatics check just to
see if you can squeeze through the space
 Your small goblin form has no real
problem you have to rearrange your skull at a
certain angle to make it through the gap but you
do manage to make your way through to the opposite
side of the chamber
 You see the simple chamber It looks like
at first there was unfinished carvings in the
wall so it looks like the carvings come to a
completion and then the rest of it is a solid
stone interior that stops at a wall on the
opposite end about  feet in and stairs that
slowly curve down about tenfoot wide just begin
to go on a wide spiral downward
 Make an investigation check
 Okay So Amongst the right hand carving
you look within one of the simple portions of a
pillar or an obelisk as part of this carving that
looks like a similar construct to the city that
surrounds this temple but the obelisk itself
appears to protrude from a slight groove from
behind this actual gap behind the obelisk and you
reach through and give it a tug It pulls forward
about an inch at which point the doors All
three of the doors open at once and the fountain
raises up to close and return to where it was
above
 You fill a pocket with fruit
 Okay You grab some fruit and put it in your
bag
 Jamedis waiting for all of this to happen
Avantika isnt immediately visible
 Mmhm
 You can see the southern wall Avantika is
rushing back towards you Well done
Congratulations Shall we
 I was inspecting the other chambers as they
opened
 Snakes and a dead body Huh
 Theres a corpse in the other chamber
 Rotted flesh and some bones
 Ive seen a few in my time Perhaps even
caused a few She looks at you with a grin
 You watch as this brief burst of
flame  in front
 This is going to be so much fun
 That was not part of the arrangement You
are proving your use to me as my companions and
part of my team As the captain of the ship and as
your superior I tell you what to do and you do it
 So what you kill me then return and my
entire crew just wipes you out as you arrive
 Oh I can read between the lines quite
strongly there Fjord I appreciate that Look
this is not me trying to impose my will just
continue the arrangement we made And I do not
feel like taking the lead No That is not the
safest route for the captain eh
 No shes visible
 Yeah Theres a dead body there
 Make a perception check
 Looking around you see the egg clutches
You see the body Not much else in there
 It looks like a decomposed corpse Tattered
clothing broken leather belt a simple satchel
hangs open just rotted and gone Its been there
for a long time
 You go ahead and scoot down for a look
 You have no idea
 She was the first to inspect the body So
who is to make their descent How about you
Captain Tusktooth Will you choose one of your
subordinates to lead the fray into the
subterranean chambers
 I think shes volunteering huh
 That sounds unanimous then Beauregard I
believe is the name that they keep calling you
Please find your way down Well be right behind
you
 All right so whats the marching order
 Pretty big
 Beauregards in front
 Whos after Beauregard
 All right Jesters after Beauregard
 Okay so well put Caleb and Nott here
 All right and Avantika is going to stay
back with Fjord and Caduceus and Yasha is going
to be right in front of you guys All righty Are
you descending quietly
 I need you all to make a stealth check
 Mmhmm
 Roll for Yasha if you dont mind as well
 All right Beau
 While you catch yourself about to stumble
down the stairs Yasha reaches out and catches you
and stops you pulls you back quietly under your
heels and just pats you on the shoulder and
continues walking down
TRAVIS Three natural s Thank god
 All right You guys make your way quietly
down the spiraling staircase that descends  
 feet before you see it begin to open into
another chamber Jamedi has the torchlight and
stays back so as to not let any flickering light
pollute into the next room He gives a nudge into
that direction and you can see where the stairway
continues to descend but theres an area where
the wall comes to an end Theres an open chamber
lurking on the other side
 Continuing through Jamedis staying back
not wanting to show the torchlight Whos going
ahead to
 Ill show you what you see
 As you look past the corner on that
staircase into this chamber you see these three
large loadbearing pillars intricately carved
that make their way to the ceiling of this roughly
foot chamberIn the center of it a pool of
water around a small well but the entire chamber
itself is filled with about an inch or two of
water While its not a glass surface Theres a
slight disturbance to it Theres a slight shift
A shape that is currently coiled quietly On this
end one of the large fullbodied snake yuanti
that you had encountered briefly in the city
outside of the temple that had grabbed Jester and
was about to make off with her You can see the
 or foot long serpentlike lower part of the
body where there are no legs just this long
snake that coils around The muscular wide
humanlike broad shoulders and muscular arms
themselves folded forward You can see the head
this full snake head is curled in eyes closed and
almost like prayer or sleep Strung across one
side of its back is a long scimitar thats
sheathed The other shoulder has a longbow thrown
over the shoulder and there is a beautiful silver
shield almost like silver and marble thats
resting on the ground next to its coil and its
quietly looking down towards the pool of water
There are a couple of other raised platforms in
the chamber Decorative or ceremonial youre
uncertain but it is quiet and what little
movement that remains there is probably just the
very faint ripples of the last bit of physical
activity this creature had made amongst the
surface of the two to three inches of water that
fills the chamber
 From what Beau can see yes The well is
risen above it and the surface is still on the top
of that well
 Since the fight Oh yeah
 What level is that
 There is no light source
 That one time
 Yes
 Why but of course I can make myself or
another invisible
 You get the sense from the fact that most of
this temple is not lit at all has no light
source they probably can see in the dark
 They have eyes not necessarily to see
 Smoke still obscures in darkness
 Yes
 Is it Philip yes
 I can throw this and she tosses the
dagger and catches it But I am more of a up
close and personal eviscerator
 You can certainly try
 Okay Given the circumstance I would put
Jester and Nott nearest to the top here
 Right Behind Jester and Nott would be
whom
 Well say for the purposes of
 Whos at the back of that Sorry
 All righty Whos after them
 Well say Avantika will be about there
 Jamedis staying back here with the group
 That is the marching order as you guys are
in the staircase
 It does not make a sound It is illusory
 Were both right

 Whats the plan Whos going first
 Make a perception check Jester
 From here best you can tell its eyes are
closed
 All right Invoke Duplicity  feet away
Thats where it appears
 Right Like right there
 Adjacent okay
 All right both attack with advantage
 Melee spell attacks Its an ambush It
doesnt know youre there
 Correct
 That hits And you
 You are yes
 Ten misses
 Correct
 No it does not It has to occupy space for
it to be an ally
 Right So it should just be a single
attack
 The first one you rolled
 That would hit so roll damage
 Because it is an ambush you get advantage on
that
 Oh it was a critical hit
 No no
 Its okay Youre thinking of a critical
hit
 Its all good No worries So the total is
  points of damage That is not bad at
all
 All righty Then
  points of damage in one round 
The bolt hits Immediately the creature 
The eyes flash open and looks around sees the
illusion looks in the direction where the bolt
came from and glances up and sees you at the top
of the stairway Everyone roll initiative

 All right  to 
 Nobody  to 
 On what What did you get It was Nott
 Fjord got what
 All righty
 Then Caleb got a  Now it is
 Ten to five
 Aww What did Yasha get
 That means that if you guys have any
creative ways to do combined attacks the three of
you can go at the same time and be fun with it
 Correct Well essentially in that order you
would be able to be like  right
before somebody hit if you wanted to Because
youre still on the same initiative order
 Yeah That brings us to the top of the
combat round Beau youre up first
 Well you have  feet as your distance
right
  Thats one move Thatll get you
about there
 Yeah you can do that
 Try it out It is  feet from you
 Yeah go for it
 Yeah Its a ranged
  hits
 All right Roll damage for each
 Ds yep
 Well hold on If its a monk weapon because
its the shuriken you got
 Oh but the darts Theyre not monk weapons
yeah
 Yeah The daggers or something akin to that
would be a monk weapon
  damage total
 You can move five more feet there to get
behind that pole if you want
 Okay
 Patient Defense would be your bonus action
 Youre not going to do that Then you still
have a bonus action
 Sure
 I think its an unarmed attack actually
For your bonus action
 Ill double check
 The Players Handbook has vanished from me
 Its all good While Im looking this up
anything else
 An unarmed strike is a bonus action so you
cannot throw a third shuriken
 Hold All right Thats Beaus turn Next up
is Nott Nott you are up next
 Fjord youre on deck
 This way
 All right Five ten 
 Go for it
  hits
 It does not count as an adjacent ally
unfortunately
  points of damage Nice As the three
shurikens stick into its form 
 It sees you rush past and 
 Okay It looks  it looks up
 and cant quite track you It does see
Jester up in the stairway though
 Its now its turn as the abomination takes
its round It is going to pull its scimitar out
and rake it across the stone carving sparks and
grinding off some of them causing this echo
throughout the chamber before resheathing it and
pulling its longbow out and getting it out to fire
a volley of two arrows at Jester
 With the longbow you are in its first
range First attack is  to hit
 Oh yeah that does hit You take  points
of piercing damage as well as
 As well as  points of poison damage
 As the arrow  its longer than an
average arrow This longbow is a longbow for one
of these large abominations and it just sinks into
you It pulls back for another arrow
 That is a 
 This one you deflect it and the arrow
splinters off and hits the wall With that its
going to move behind here and is now back to the
wall and its getting another arrow ready That
brings the end of his turn Fjord youre up
 Here back
 Well say there there there
 Well youre glancing your eye its where
you looking at Going to land wherever it lands
wherever you want to place it
 foot radius Yeah thatll definitely be
good
 Back there Yeah thats about right The
whole area fills with darkness and these strange
somewhat translucent slimy tendrils occasionally
whip out the sides of this orb where light cannot
pierce Thats your action and your movement is
that the end of your turn
 All right That brings us to Caleb Youre
up
 You come around the chamber and you look and
all you see is a giant sphere of blackness You
have no idea where the creature is
 Lets double check
 No light magical or otherwise can
illuminate the area and creatures fully within
the area are blinded
 Yeah you havent seen it yet
 You are concentrating on that All righty
That ends Calebs turn
 All right That brings us to Yasha
Caduceus and Jester
 All right d plus five I believe
 Of course
 Remember if she doesnt attack or be
attacked she loses her rage next round
 Shes going double rush in
    
 Dash and she can get over on this side you
mean
 Over here
 All right Now the chamber primarily is
now visible to everybody without issue yourself included
 Is it an action to cast Light as a cantrip
 Well you had cast Light previously on the
edge of your staff Youre still giving off your
own light source
 Are you going to stay put then
 In the back of the hallway there
 Mmhmm
 Okay Back a few steps Make an attack with
disadvantage if youre going to be doing
something else
 Are you doing another Inflict Wounds
 All right
 Okay
 You go to release Spell is expended but no
impact on the creature unfortunately rdlevel
spell used
 Back up here All righty
 Crowded hallway All right
 Start of the turn got it
 All right At the top of his turn However
you guys both finish Yasha did her turn Youre
all done there looks good Now comes to Avantika
and Jamedi Avantikas going to charge down
 Goes in there with blades out ready to go
Jamedi is going to come forward and take the torch
and throw it further inside It clatters this way
helps illuminate that side of the chamber and
then backs up
 Correct It lights everything around it
 Top of the round The surface of the well
begins to bubble and move The water begins to
rise up like the surface bubbles up and begins to
pour on the side As you watch this large
snakelike serpent head arrives And another And
another And another You see emerging from the
center of this chamber
  the true guardian
 the Warden Spoken of
in the text above
 It definitely enters the Hunger of Hadar
 A dexterity saving throw on its point there
That is a ten
 Ten points of cold damage to the hydra
 All right Gotcha
 Right now Avantikas the one closest to
it
 Moves forward
 Has a reach of ten Doesnt have to fully
get into melee with her Its going to take
multiple attacks at her
 You see this body emerge from it That is a
natural one Good for her That misses  That
hits That hits and that hits With that
Avantika takes  points of piercing damage Ten
points of piercing damage and  points of
piercing damage
 Avantika shes like Holy fucking shit I
could use some assistance
 She is just trying to fight these things
off All right now its Beaus turn
 It does
 Got it Its burning and holding it in
place slowing it down but it seems to neglect it
for the most part
 All right That brings us to
  Beaus turn
 All right
 As Beau swings around Hasted
 Not at its current position
 You can get into the pool if you want to
 Where do you want to be Here Here
 All righty Go for it
  just misses Your staff just scrapes off
of its hard armor
 You still have a bonus action
 What are you going to do Dont listen to
them do what you were going to do
 No Disengage is an action unless youre a
rogue and had that ability
 Probably
 Okay Thats good
 One per head
 That finishes Beaus turn Nott youre up
 Its a singular creature
 Step of the Wind allows you to do that
 Nott what are you doing
 Go for it
  to attack Misses
 Yeah she doesnt know youre there so it
would be advantage since you were hidden previously
 That does hit
 You do get sneak attack damage
  points of damage to it Strikes into it
one of the heads looks back into your direction
glancing around
 Back which way to here
 Got it That finishes your turn Nott Its
now the abominations turn
 Yes it does
  points nice Slithers out of the
radius
 Sees Yasha and sees Avantika Avantikas
handled now by the hydra Hes going to now look
towards Yasha and take two arrow strikes at her
 Yep
 No the abomination right there
 No shes not raging That is an  to hit
 And a  to hit She takes six points of
piercing damage and eight points of poison damage
 Second attack is  points of piercing
damage
  points of piercing damage and ten points
of poison damage She got lucky on those rolls
there Its going to stay back here in the corner
trying to keep away Its just using its arrows
from a distance Its starting to show some wear
and tear This guy over here has been pummelled
with a few things and the tentacles have been
tearing through him but hes staying outside of
the radius of that sphere That finishes his go
Fjord youre up
 Youre moving you said
 Okay here As youre moving in that
direction  this against the hydra
 That hits
 Ooh
  points of damage As both bolts slam into
the head you watch as the head pops
 Actually blasts them off the hydra
 But now you know
 Hexblades Curse right there That brings
us to Caleb
 That hits
 All right roll the first d Double this
  points of damage You watch as another
head gets burnt to cinders From the nearby
impact it actually cauterizes where the first head was
destroyed and where the second one was destroyed
 All right
 That finishes Calebs turn It is now Yasha
Caduceus and Jesters
 From this position you cannot
 Hmm youd have to get this way and you
dont have enough you could try and leap off
here Youd have to make an acrobatics check to
see if you land properly
 All right you step out and see the hydra
This sphere is preventing you from seeing the abomination
 Okay
 Charisma save No that is an eight
 Im looking it up again
 Right Youre concentrating on that
 It is concentration for up to one minute
 Yep That is Bane
 Is that where youre staying
 All right pop back out Healer tactics
 That finishes Caduceuss turn Jester and
Yasha
 Let me just double check something as far as
your duplicate is concerned
 It might be the case it might not be Ill
double check here
 No it just says you create it for a
minute it says its concentration an unoccupied
space you can move the illusion for  feet in
space you can see but it must remain within 
feet of you
 But you cannot see any of these spaces where
it is
 You can Right now its consumed in
darkness You cannot see anything past this The
Hunger of Hadar is blocking all your vision You
do not know where your illusion is you just see
this large sphere of darkness
 Correct
 Technically no but nevertheless
 To a space you can see you can but it
would be over on this side
 Over next to Beau on this side
 You could try to
 You can get it right there on the cusp
floating above the top there Its just peering
out and its visible to you now
 Go for it Roll for an attack
  hits Roll damage

 You are correct That finishes your turn
Yasha
 You move back all right
 This way 
 Okay that finishes Yashas go Top of the
round Now the hydra goes
 The hydra spins around to face Beau who has
now moved up
 Now only three functional heads its going
to take three swipes at Beau
  Double natural ones Thats
impressive Minus three
 Thats a 
 Thats 
 With Bane
 You take  points of piercing damage as it
suddenly two heads you manage to dodge by
theres one that was moving too quick that you
didnt see coming and
 
 Then it still hits you Bites you in the
side lifts you off the ground from the impact and
you feel the teeth crunch into your abdomen You
manage to elbow your way out and land and you can
see the fresh teeth marks starting to bleed down
the side
 Its going to move out and into range with
both of them right there
 Shes not within range
 No they have a reach of ten
 All right so thats going to bring us to
Beau Youre up
 Thats true yeah
 That lowers it to 
 Plus five on his con
 Roll one more dice just in case its a
crit
 There you go
 Gave you that to you as a freebie
 Plus zero
 No vulnerability for the hydra
 Yeah
 Six points of damage there
 Go for it
  hits
 That misses You have one more hit
 Rolling series of strikes you pull some
information from it Manages to pummel the sides
of this base where its torso is Well done Does
that end your turn
 Okay you stay where you are That brings us
to Nott
 With your explosive bolt
 Okay
 All righty Youre holding your action
 It is now the abominations turn The
abomination or Avantikas turn
 I feel like I forgot Avantikas turn
 And Jamedi Avantika would have darted
around and gotten into melee with the hydra
 Ooh nice Natural  on one of those hits
Thats a   points of damage to it
 Correct from Avantika
 Yeah those were two rapier strikes
Finishes her go Jamedi is just shaking and not
even getting involved in the combat Too scared to
go in That brings us to the abominations turn
whos going to turn around the corner rise up on
the platform here
 Thats a good thing yeah because it turned
around and its going to take two shots at you
with its longbow
 That is 
 And 
  points of piercing damage
 Including  points of poison damage
 Correct So you take six
 Well here you resisted all of the damage
from the arrow entirely Thats pretty slick
Yeah it doesnt even catch you No poison You
manage to stop it in place The poison doesnt
even hit your system
 Watching you reach behind and catch the
arrow and stop it from going there and the second
one just manages to dodge past you 
Its going to go ahead and
 Thats when you take the d
 Spitting it out on the side your lips and
tongue go a little numb All right that ends its
go Fjord youre up and then Caleb youre on
deck
  hits
 Youre concentrating on that I forgot about
that
 Did you add your extra damage for your
Hexblades Curse
 That finishes your turn Fjord Caleb
youre up
 All righty
 Well this would be concentration
regardless
 The abomination that is a natural  plus
two thats a  Whats your DC
 For the hydra
 Its a natural 
 Minus three for the Bane Thats 
 This ends Calebs go That brings us to
 Caleb moves off to the side Yasha
Caduceus and Jester
 Jester steps out to the side Throw it
high
 Make a strength check
 Nott roll an attack roll
 No you do not
 So  The barrel  The bolt arrow
firing and detonates somewhere on the opposite side
of the chamber as the barrel  into the
water of the well in the center there You hear a
splash of water
 That wouldve been spectacular if it had
worked
 There you go
 All righty
 Okay got it That finishes that turn
Caduceus
 To Yasha
 There you go
 She is flanking with Avantika yes
 Correct you dont have to You can if you
want to
  misses Goes wide second strike
  does hit  was the threshold
 Yeah and she still does her divine damage
 Doubled so its  points of damage
Another head is carved off of its body
 That ends Yashas go
 Its now Avantikas turn Avantika is going
to take three strikes at it The rapier both
hit  and  naturally The dagger misses with a
four Oh shit   points of damage
  points of damage from Avantika carves off
another head There is now one head on the hydra
 Next up is Jamedi whos staying out of the
fray Next is the hydras turn The hydra who
only has one head but is slowed and can only make
one attack anyway is going to swing back to you
since youre the one who looks the most damaged
too and it wants to start taking something down
 No against you
 Ooh thats a natural  against you
 No you specifically got out of sight
 It happens as it happens so roll for
Yasha
 She cant reckless out of turn
 Its all good
  just hits Roll damage for Yasha Thats
cocked That is  points of piercing damage to
you Beau
 Mmhmm
 Nice Its starting to look hurt
 Hold on a second At the end of its turn
ah End of its turn it grows two heads for each
of its heads that died since its last turn unless
its taken fire damage Since it was slowed and
did not take fire damage it regrows four new
heads
 Its a natural ability Its not an action
It just happens at the end of its roll
 No the cauterized ones are still gone but
the two that it lost last turn
 Yes
 It makes a wisdom save against the Slow
right
 At the end of its turn Natural 
 Oh right yeah This could do it Minus
one  Whats the DC
 At the end of the spell
 A creature affected by the spell makes
another wisdom saving throw at the end of its
turn On a successful save the effect ends
 No whats your spell DC
 It succeeds the save
 I just rolled It was a one on the d It
brought it from  to  He succeeded The Slow
fails and it does regenerate some hit points from
regaining the two heads back All right That ends
the hydras turn Beau youre up
 Go for it
 Not from Beau its not Yasha and Avantika
are flanking
  hits
  misses unfortunately
 Okay
 Avantika and Jamedi are at the very bottom
 She already went She was the one who cut
off one of the heads and then it came back
 Patient Defense for Beau That brings us to
Nott
 Yep Its still over there in the darkness
somewhere
 Go for it Roll for an attack I was hoping
Fluffernutter was going to work
 Im so sorry
  misses it goes wide
 You are hidden You have advantage on that
  does hit so roll damage
  Ooh nice All right It takes the
damage It sinks into one of the necks Its body
is taking wounds heavily Its hurt Its not on
the edge of its life but its hurt That finishes
Notts turn Its now the abominations turn
 Correct He is going to go ahead and cant
take a reaction right
 Oh man The only one close enough to do
anything is Beau Its going to sweep up behind
Beau and take one giant swing with its scimitar at
you
 With disadvantage Yes staying just on the
cusp of the bubble Disadvantage because of
Patient Defense Which is good you did because its
was a natural  and then a five That brings it
to  It totally misses It swings wide It would
have been a head cleaving blow and out of the
corner of your eye you see it with your Patient
Defense ready and watch it slowly carve past
catching a couple hairs on the side of your head
as you duck out of the way
 Then it makes a wisdom save to see if it can
to see if it can resist that Natural  plus two
 No still slowed Man That fucks him up too
bad That ends his go Fjord youre up
 Dropping the Hunger of Hadar
 Correct Now the chamber is visible
 That hits
 What did you roll
  No It misses
 With that you blow off another one of its
heads
 There you go Now its down to four heads
 Fjord the stump goes limp laying on the
ground but there out of the corner of your eye
you can see another head or two little snouts
beginning to try and regenerate out of that neck
point You now are seeing those processes of
regeneration With each head that is removed it
immediately begins to try and regrow in its space
That finishes your turn Fjord
 Caleb youre up
 How many Slow slots do you have
 But youve cast Haste when you got in here
and you cast Slow earlier so thats two
 Thats right thlevel You get a third
slot Thats correct I was thinking you had two
Yeah all right
 DC  with Bane For the abomination with
Bane thats  with him So he fails
 So hes still Slowed And the hydra

 Thats fucked up It was a natural 
 Technically you lose concentration on the
When you recast a concentration spell it drops before
 I understand but Slow is an area effect
meaning you can hit multiple enemies Theres no
reason to not hit him Otherwise you lose the
concentration
 If you want to look at the dice
 I know That was
 Right but then I rolled a four on the Bane
which brought it down to a  Which is exactly
the DC Thats fucked up Thats why I laughed I
was like Thats really stupid
 All right well ducked back behind It
maintains basically where it was before That
finishes up your round Caleb Yasha Caduceus
and Jester
 Okay Correct
 To not be a stickler on
 Im just saying There was no benefit to not
choosing the snake guy because he would have lost
his slow if you cast it on just the hydra and
recasting it again you can choose them both which
means there was no benefit other than
retroactively doing the die rolls
 Correct
 Im sorry man
 Wizards are highrisk highreward for that
reason That brings us to Yasha Caduceus and Jester
 Okay Wisdom save on him natural 
 Yeah Plus two its 
 Oh a dex save Thats even higher Thats a

 Sorry
 That finishes Jesters go
 Youre putting your back against the wall
here
 You look at him and hes genuinely scared
 How many times have you used it now
 Thats right Because of short rest Got it
Okay That brings us to Yasha
 Youre still flanking with Avantika
 Yeah that definitely hits
 Thats  points doubled So that becomes

 With that another one of the heads is
carved off reducing this
 That hits
 Its hurting real bad
 Thats rough That finishes Yashas go
Avantika its now her turn to go Three attacks
Oof thats not a good round A two a three and
 on the dagger That hits though Five points
of damage for Avantika
 Jamedi is just going to stare back at you
and be like I was not hired for this That
brings us to the hydras turn
 Sure Make an insight check
 Hard to read The hydra now that it has
technically advantage with the abomination across
from you Beau its going to take its attack
 Because they have you flanked
 That means its a straight attack for you
 That is  to hit
 All right
 Right That would make it 
 There you go
 That is  brought to 
 That hits Roll damage for Yasha
 Ooh That is  points of piercing damage
 That is 
 With the Bane brought it down to  I rolled a three
It was a  Hes rolling really good this round
 That is  points of piercing damage
 That finishes the hydras turn The hydra now
regrows
 Come here buddy
 It is back up to five heads now
Its looking really rough though With Beau down
its going to slither up over here and
get into melee with you Caduceus
 Because you already used your reaction to do so
In which case actually its going to slither
even further up into getting with melee with
Jester as well Now the heads are curling down
inside and its making its way to up into the
hallway That ends the hydras turn Beau I need
you to roll a death saving throw please
 First failed death save Nott youre up
 Its in the water currently Right there

 Okay You scoot around the corner
  hits
 Hes so close Hes still slowed
and you watch him 
 All right you grab the keg
 That hits Roll damage
 Just right through the temple
Onto the ground Youre just holding the keg there
 Okay That ends your turn Nott That
would have been the abominations turn but hes
dead That brings us to Fjord
 That hits
 That does not hit
 You undo its healing from last round
 Meaning it healed up  points and then you
just did  You blast its body and part of its
back muscles are exposed and bits of bone are
showing It still has all of these heads that are
sinking forward and desperately biting around it
but its looking really rough That finishes your
turn Fjord Caleb youre up
 Correct you were just out of its range
 Well this curves around so you can get that
close but you cant see it
 Thats where you can see it Any further and
youre not going to be able to see it
 Go for it It has technically
threequarters cover because of most of its
covered by the rest of the chamber
 Thats half cover
 Yeah Next to Jester there will get you into
its melee zone
 Its in the melee zone
 Hold on a second
 Just letting you know you have disadvantage
on attacks when youre in melee with something
 Correct
 Its either get into melee and have
disadvantage or take threequarters cover
 Well its disadvantage or it gets plus five
to its AC Your call
 All right so you get in there
 You can yes
  misses The bolt goes wide arcing past
it
 You are in melee range yes
 All right youre staying there
 All right that ends Calebs turn Yasha
Caduceus and Jester
 That is a natural 
 A four Fails Actually no technically
 In casting Spirit Guardians which is a
concentration spell your Bane drops So it does succeed
 Okay well just walk that back a little
bit
 Yeah Spirit Guardians is a concentration of
ten minutes
 Okay then You are in its melee so
disadvantage on the attack roll
 Whatever your spell attack modifier is
 I think its plus eight
  misses unfortunately Guiding Bolt goes
wide
 You turn invisible which means youre still
there this is the mark that youre invisible
That means any attacks against you have
disadvantage
 Two space over
 Here you mean
 Inside the tunnel you mean
 That finishes your turn Some bad rolls you
guys Im sorry Jester
 You have to move forward to see it
 You can move there and glance up the side
if you want
 You can see Beau
 Cure Wounds with yes
 Im sorry
 That ends your turn Jester
 Its Yashas turn
 Sure
 There you go
 At the moment no because nobody is
directly into melee with it theyre just within
its reach
 That hits
 Well there you go
  just hits
 Okay and the next attack
 How does Yasha want to do this
 The blade shinks out the front and then
 With a violent swing the
torso splits apart with Yasha standing over the
back and leaping off behind it where it falls and
slides down the steps to the base of the bottom
chamber
 With the hydra slain and fallen everyone
looks around taking a moment breathing heavily
taking in the much worse way that could have gone
a few times
 Both Nott and Caleb are
 As you step out you look down and see
Avantika walking up and kicking the body and
looking at the rest of you Theres sweat in her
brow little smear of her own blood down the front
of her face Not bad Not bad at all You can
stay on the crew
 Puts her blades away And thats where were
going to pick up next week
 What
 I love the mini it comes with so many
heads
 That was fun
 Well done guys
 Man I wanted that to explode so bad
 If you had thrown it high enough if you hit
it it would have just hit the hydra but that low
roll was just this low arc It would have probably
hit Beau and everything around it
 In essence with the low strength roll its
probably best that you missed because it would
have been
 It would have been like a free Fireball
essentially
 I dont know you still can use it
 Youll figure it out
 Well pick up for this next time we play
which will be in two weeks technically because
well be at MCM However next week you get to see
Lauras amazing oneshot shes running Enjoy
that Well pick up this campaign November st
Well get to see the aftermath of this battle
explore this chamber and what the things youve
learned and hope to learn mean Until we get to
then guys we love you very much and is it
Thursday yet Good night

 Points to Travis on that one Its the
ellipses at the end Like a little squeak Last we
left off The Mighty Nein in pursuing a thread of
a mysterious orb that seemed to connect in some
way to the entity in which Fjord has somehow
connect himself to and as such been granted these
strange eldritch powers led you southward from
the Menagerie Coast after commandeering a ship
called The Mist turned into The Mistake Followed
it through some dangerous reefs to a pirate ship
called the Squalleater and there on the captain
Avantika You made a pact with her where the
choice was to either die or to help aid her and a
companion she hired for this to help navigate this
island This strange seemingly dangerous or
cursed island to which you made your way through
the jungle of this Urukaxl Managed to avoid
lizardmen Managed to barely sneak through a
ancient city of yuanti Making your way to the
top of this temple and through the interior A
series of battles later an encounter with a
strange lightless internal orchard in which two of
the fruit within had been eaten by two members of
your team and have been tripping balls ever since
 You made your way to the bottom
subterranean guardian chamber where you met a
yuanti abomination that was laying guard to the
around and laid waste to much of your party but
you managed to through a series of clever
choices uses of fire magic and some rapid
assaults managed to cleave all the heads from its
body and kill it just in time Its corpse now
lying fresh on the ground Captain Avantika
seeming pleased and impressed by the display of
the strange new compatriots that have now come to
work under her You now sit in the stillness of
this chamber able to now finally take a moment to
look about and see what secrets or mysteries it
holds So Mighty Nein what would you like to do
 Avantika is sitting down for a second and
getting her breath The rest of you who are still
up in the hallway which is Jester Caduceus and
Jamedi and Caleb all begin to slowly descend the stairs
 No its currently slung over the side of
the staircase that curves down into the
subterranean chamber
 Two healing potions and an EpiPen Hold on
 Jamedis currently standing at the top
glancing around the side
 He glances around and steps down another
step I was not paid to do anything of this sort
I was a guide I was to delve I am not skilled in
the ways you are Im not stupid to throw myself
in front of a beast so large
 Actually make a perception check
 Looking at his person he has a short bow
and a dagger and that is it Hes not armed for
any sort of main assault In fact most of his
equipment and materials in the way hes armored
and dressed is for expediency lack of sound and
meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy
A lot of browns grays and dull greens Hes
definitely more of a scout and a tracker based on
his skill set from what youve seen than any sort
of frontline fighter
 As you approach she gets up and rummages
off the side and pulls off a small lantern she
keeps notched on the side of her belt
 Make a perception check
 Nothing in particular beyond what she
previously had that you can tell at the moment
no Its a small lantern maybe that big and she
pulls a piece of cloth out that was meant to keep
it from clattering or making any noise on the
inside She pulls out the cloth tucks it in her
pocket ignites the end of an oil wick The
lantern glows a bit and gives off some light She
begins walking along the walls of the inside of
the chamber
 As you cast Detect Magic a few things All
of your friends give off a faint aura Everything
but Jamedi gives off a magical aura You also
sense the columns themselves have a fairly
powerful deep magical aura to them Thats the
most you can see at the moment
 Nothing Fjord as you begin to walk along
what would be considered the southern walls around
this side of the chamber you and Avantika
looking across the walls appear to be made of the
same eldest stone that this temple is made from
The newer materials that have been plastered and
set against what once was this original temple did
not make its way this far into the basement It
seems that there is no intent to cover or at
least hasnt gotten to the point of covering what
originally lined the walls of this chamber and as
such the original carvings remain What you see
are three massive carved murals on that wall that
wall and this far side mirroring the placement
of the three pillars These murals stand probably
 feet tall and about  or so feet wide You can
see them depicting these giant faintly detailed
and gently colored scenes though a lot of the
coloration seems to have faded with dust and time
Some of the stone has been stained or painted to
show some variation in color You can make out the
simple shapes to fill out this much larger
tapestry on the stone before you The one on that
far wall as you come across it you see a crowd
of people Simple design but definitive heads and
shoulders and legs You can see the humanoid form
and there are many many clustered around the base
of this mural Above them you can see three
larger humanoid figures that are haloed by a light
or an aura that elevates them beyond this crowd
Three figures Then over the top of that taking
up probably  percent or more of this mural you
see a humongous bird of dark purple flame that is
wreathing the sky above this crowd You see its
wings curved upward and then bent down and where
the wings end fire curls and burns and the
feathers on the edges of these wings definitively
come up into a purple and dark gray flame with
bits and specks of deep red At the top where its
head looks down the beak long and pointed there
are three eyes across its face and in each of
these eyes you see set a rather large onyx stone
 A large flaming bird
 Like a phoenix but dark purples and grays
and deep reds in color
 Each one of those eyes is an onyx stone
Probably about that big
 You dont see any magical essence on the
carving or the stones just from those pillars
Glancing at the pillars too theres faint carved
designs and shapes like swirling almost
serpentine circles and curves that chain into each
other and swirl off Imagine a column made of
chains if you will but the patterns are erratic
in places and dont seem to follow
 From what you can tell no
 Thats the far wall If you continue curving
around to the one closest to me you meet up with
Avantika at that point She holds her lantern up
and you can see a very similar layout a very
familiar showing of a crowd Much like the
previous one though some of their shapes have
different shoulders It looks almost like their
clothing or whatever their accoutrements are are
different It seems to insinuate a different
people Above them three more figures stand
shown larger and emanating some sort of radiance
or aura Above that you see this giant coiled
serpent of scale fin and eyes made of amber
Each of these eyes is a separate amber piece about
that big around the size of a large gold piece
all along the coil of its body At the very top
where its rearing up this very long thin
pointed almost lizardlike maw opens up and
behind it this giant tidal wave is curling and
frozen in place looking like its about to bear
down on and either destroy or sweep away the crowd
below it
 Very much so
 On this one the head of it has three eyes
as well but the body itself has eyes evenly
spaced around the entire length of its coiled
body
 Every single eye on it is a piece of amber
matching size
 They all appear to be present
 More detail has been put into them More
care has been placed into their carving
 Avantika continues curving around with a
big wideeyed smile on her face As she passes by
it she goes This is incredible
 I can only assume this is carved by the
KiNau
 That is correct
 She continues curving around Beau and
Caduceus as you walk to the other wall that side
of the chamber there you see a curling thick
worm of some kind Its folded skin and toothlike
scales burrowing up to produce mountains over the
crowd cliff faces made of stone and rock breaking
and about to plummet into the crowd below There
beneath it you see three figures once more
elevated the same wreath around them of some sort
of radiance or light The people below dont seem
scared Theres no sign of fleeing or fear just a
gathering Within this large terrifying
wormlike creature its form bulbous with these
strange protrusions these spinelike scales that
you can imagine would pull it through the broken
earth you see this ring of teeth that accentuates
where its mouth is and on the inside where a
tongue would be there instead are three eyes
across the inside of its mouth These appear to be
made of some kind of ivory some polished white material
 The three figures all appear to be humanoid
Theyre not detailed enough to the point where you
can see features to differentiate between elven
human halfling
 Its just silhouettes of three figures
 You hear Avantikas voice echo from across
the way She goes These are the Chosen She
brings light over towards the one of Ukotoa on
the wall and goes I guess that makes this one
me She takes her finger and takes a little blood
from the corner of her mouth from the fight and
draws a little smiley face on one of the three
And this one is you and goes and draws another
face on the middle one
 That is a very good question
 Only one yes
 They were a very informative partner They
are the one that introduced me to the great
possibility of power under Ukotoa We traveled
this ocean for quite a number of years together
but they proved to be a coward They took
something important to our mission and vanished
and I have spent many years trying to recover what
they stole With no luck I figured it was more
worth my time to pillage enough coin to pay other
people to find them for me And so far based on
the fact that it brought you to me a much more
successful endeavor eh
 This is very true Well it seems I may
have some information Lets get back to the ship
eh Lets finish our business here and lets talk
over a glass of wine
 This is true She begins to make her way
towards the well at the center of the chamber
 Glancing about at the pillars you two can
see within the shapes glowing runes that trace
from ceiling to floor then across the ground and
all meet at the well
 Its not technically a language These are
runes These are glyphs of some kind Make an
arcana check
 There are different epochs in historical
time in which there have been advances and
developments of arcane runes and sigils There is
the early basis of magical runes which is a
deviation of Draconic as a language and then
there are ways that theyve been altered and made
more efficient These are very old base early
Draconic runes As such they hold a lot more very
primal magical power and usually are reserved for
larger rituals and magics that are meant to last
for very long periods of time The nature of the
magic on these runes from what you can tell its
a little hard to get the direct essence but there
is some sort of an abjurationbased magic
 You head on over to the other yuanti and
as you approach the body lies there tongue
lolling out and drool and blood a mixture of
thick saliva mingling with the dark blackpurple
blood out of the corner of its mouth its eyes
wide open and rolled back Its dark thick green
scales of its snakelike head and thick muscular
scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where
it was slain Its blade has clattered to the
ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished
marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from
its form The rest of its tail coils and is limp
off to the side from there
 Make an investigation check
 Nice You find on its body  pieces of
gold Only gold no other pieces of coin on its
body The blade is a very very large blade It
looks like its well made both for ceremonial
purposes and for actual combat It is both
beautiful and very well made and the shield
itself is also exquisitely crafted and shows no
signs of wear
 Okay At this point Avantikas walked to
the edge of the well and looks down into the space below
 Do you really
 She whips around as you do that and both her
hand grabs your wrist to deflect it and you wrench
your wrist free as a natural instinct and you both
have this moment of
 Hes still at the top of the stairs He
goes Well for one thing I was paid to go to
the temple and no further The fact that I have
even come this far is because I need to claim my pay
 Avantika goes Actually I think ladies
first
 May the best one win She dives in
 Okay you jump in First off Calebs
distraction has given her quite a lead Shes a
fairly accomplished swimmer and is making her way
down This well continues on for a good   or
so feet below The water is cold It is salt
water
 Right You are swimming after her
 Make an athletics check You have advantage
because the water is because of your armor its
not giving you as much resistance heading south
 You begin to close the gap slowly but shes
eagerly swimming down with almost a fervor As you
get deeper into this column this basin below the
walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime
like a thick It could be a plant matter thats
just accrued over the walls or it could be waste
matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly
congealed to cover the walls The stone begins to
give way to this dark slick material Once you
hit about the   foot point the tunnel begins
to open like a giant bulb or internal spherical
chamber Role another athletics check
 Shes still keeping her distance from you
Heading deeper in the saltiness of the water the
brininess the flavor in your mouth gets more
intense What was once a semblance of sea water is
definitively sea water but also very strongly
briny sea water Make another athletics check
 Correct
 For you because you have dark vision you
can see within  feet of you essentially As far
as you look the chamber is
 No Not at all Its pitch black down here
That being the case you dont see the bottom of
the chamber you just see it open
 And just her but shes gaining
 Just delving straight down into the
darkness Make another athletics check
  okay She did not role that well that
time Shes beginning to tire it seems or at
least youre starting to pick up speed As you
continue to follow you get probably  or so feet
from her but shes still ahead of you Role
again
 Natural  nice She rolled okay You see
now the bottom begin to approach In the
peripheral of your dark vision the floor greets
to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where
you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the
same time You both hit She looks up at you and
your eyes meet A few bubbles escape from her
mouth and you see her big wide toothy grin and
she begins scraping grime off the floor
 All right Make an investigation check
 
 As the two of you are currently scraping
bits of grime and algae off the ground there are
bits of plants that are growing up like lightless
kelp that seems to have made some sort of a living
down here in this subterranean waterfilled
chamber As youre pushing through and scraping
around your hand scoops this large bit of grime
from in front of you and you can see a stone
relief at the very base of the bottom a concave
spherical shape about the size of a fist
 She notices it looks at it looks at you
What are you doing
 You can
 You go and jam your hand and its hitting
your armor You have a fullon leather plate right there
 Its about that big and you can see it is
concave Its about the size of the stone that
youd found
 You can The falchion appears in your hand
and as you do this bright yellow light is now
emanating from the center of its hilt where the
eye itself is glowing with its own lanternlike
source At which point Avantika is now rushing
towards that thing
 Make an initiative roll Because you gave
her enough time to get up right next to you and
now were going to see who gets to it first
 Her hand she has now pulled the glove from
her right hand As you go to thrust the hilt of
the falchion down towards it you see her hand
reach out and just manage to cover the little
space first As it does you can see her body
tense for a second and where her hand is this
bright familiar yellow glow seems to now spread
from between her fingers sending beams off in
multiple directions Her face looks aghast in
shock for a second and a large bubble escapes
from her mouth She looks over to you with this
dazed look and pulls her hand back There in the
palm theres this large open wound where bloods
beginning to cloud the dark water below There in
the center of this hole you can see one of the
cloven stones there At which point a bunch of
these runes begin to glow in three different
directions from around the base up the sides up
the chamber
The rest of you looking around suddenly see this
dull blue glow begin to get brighter from within
this well You watch as these runes that you guys
didnt notice except for the two of you before
begin to suddenly glow up the sides The three
pillars suddenly begin to spiral and glow as all
these runes come to life Avantika pulls back and
looks back at her hand she looks back at you her
eyes blink for a second and she just smiles and
you hear this earthshuddering soulful crack
sound rocks the entirety of the temple Bubbles
suddenly this one burst of air that had been
trapped in the ground below is all immediately
released as one and rises the water above You can
look around and see the interior of this there is
a heavy black crack in the stone of this chamber
as you guys all hear this earthshattering bam
Dust falls off the ceiling of this chamber from
the inside The pillars themselves still stand
but there are multiple places in this chamber now
where these large black cracks now seem to have
snaked their way in one instant burst across parts
of the wall
 The glowing runes blink out
 Make an investigation check
 You start pulling through the weeds and the
kelp and the grime and nothing Its all smooth
stone except for this one little alcove that you
found first Avantika is now swimming frantically
up towards the surface
 Just trying to kick She lost quite a bit of
air
 You go grab her Okay Make a grapple
check make an athletics check
 No she kicks right out of your grasp She
looks back with an expression of surprise
 Make a deception check
 She looks confused and continues swimming
upward not reading too much into it She
continues to clamber up to the surface The rest
of you as youre looking about the surface of
the water begins to spill over the sides of the
well
 He goes Yeah okay of course Jesters
like This is not very good Wheres Fjord
Shes looking over very nervously towards the
pool which now the chambers rapidly filling
Youre already at knee height
 Okay you guys glancing down Jamedis back
in the chamber his eyes wide goes We should
go Bring her back she owes me money
 As you guys all begin to climb up the
stairs the chamber is filling very quickly with
the water Its now reaching the base of the
stairs at which point as you guys Beau you
and Jester theres just enough water now where
your buoyancy carries you off your feet and youre
now actually treading water in the chamber At
which point Avantika makes it to the surface with
a large gasp of air and but a few moments later
Fjord also breaks the surface
 Its continuing to fill The stairway thats
leading upward the water has now reached the base
of the doorway and you have a few moments maybe
six seconds or so before the doorway itself is
completely filled with water
 Youre all going into a full swim here
double move half speed for all of you guys so
its going to take you a little bit
 Except for you You guys are already up
there As you all get to the stairway and make
your way up to the top the water continues to
pour up following behind you You get to the
stairs and youre having to trudge through You
get up to the next the secondary floor and there
you stand with the walls that are partially
relieved and covered and there is the stone slab
that is lifted up and theres orchard before you
What do you do
 Yeah there is the fountain but it has
been It rose back up to the top when this
chamber door was opened
 Currently no Its raised up and closed
off the front when you opened the doorway to get
deeper into the basement
 Make a perception check With you
disadvantage because you are human
 Yes
 You can see the pillar that holds the
fountain at the top and there are the stairs
still part of it and you can see where its up
there but whatever mechanism rocks
 Mmhmm
 The central chamber is now The water has
now reached the base of orchard and is now filling
 You dont know the button you never found
it
 I dont know who did
 Okay you go to the
 There are As you can see now the water
that has begun to fill up the chamber is taking
Its a little slower in here because its a much
wider space now but you can see eggs starting to
flow float out from the other chambers The other
two rooms were the two hatchery areas where you
saw the larger eggs were set
 Make an intelligence check
 No its just straight bonus
 You recall it was in the chamber where
youre standing and its not too far from the
stairs where you guys descended below
 You look over to the side Make a quick
investigation check
 You reach over and you find it and you hit
it
 The door slams shut and locks you in the
room
 You hear a grinding on the other side of the
chamber of the fountain lowering
 Nott and everybody else who hasnt left
that chamber is inside The only people that said
they were leaving that room I believe were
Caduceus who was going up
 So all of you are now locked in the chamber
with Nott
 Youre all in the chamber with Nott yeah
 The fountain raises up the chamber opens up
again
 Okay You move around you cast Mage Hand
The door slams shut the two other doors slam
shut The chamber now is about waist high in
water and you watch as the pillar begins to
slowly lower It is a slow drag down
 Okay The stairway itself if you recall
ends a little bit ways up and theres a bit of a
drop down to get to it It slowly comes down and
does meet the floor Theres a bit of a lip to get
up there now so if you ascend to the top of the
staircase there is about a ten foot or so jump
where it is smooth walls before you can actually
get to the top floor
 Yasha goes over and gives you a boost That
gives you advantage on your acrobatics check to
try and parkour up the stairs and leap off the
sides
 You leap slide off the side and manage to
fall down into the water next to it You come out
of the surface The chamber is now halfway full
and its almost starting to reach to the top
 Mighty Caduceus
 Yes
 Youre tall enough to the point where Id
say because its double the size right
 So youre  feet Youre not tall enough
for the whole chamber but youre tall enough to
push people through
 Alley ooping one after the other you grab
each person and lift them up Like a little
booster into the chamber One by one you guys all
get up into the top now and Caduceus youre too
big to get up
 You pull Caduceus up You guys are now in
the chamber standing there theres the stairs
that lead up At which point you hear footfalls
and you see coming around the corner down It
seems that the sound of the resounding crack in
this temple has drawn the attention of three
yuanti They turn the corner you see one of
them two snake arms a familiar sight as one of
the malisons comes down and two broodguard are
there What are you doing The water is now
spilling up past out of the hole and now the top
room is now starting to fill with water
 You are
 Go for it
 At this point the water seems to have
accelerated and has now filled the chamber As you fire
 All right
 Okay Youre now underwater You take your
last breath and youve all completely been
submerged in this chamber The other yuanti you
can see in the darkness below here the only bit
of light that you have are the globes still from
you Although are those concentration
 Yes
 So youre casting Light on your stick
 Okay

 I love it Whats the save on that Wisdom
I believe
 Okay the malison succeeds the two
broodguard fail Roll damage on that
 That is correct
  point of radiant damage nice
 All right
 What was the roll you had to hit
  That will hit the malison You do not
get sneak attack however
 Nice That finishes your go there
 Id allow it Because well say youre
like You were standing on the water so as youre
leaning over the surface youre like squeezing it
out
 Nice
  points of damage good So I now need
everyone to roll initiative
 Well now you dont anymore The water
surface begins to crush underneath you and then
you have to delve underneath as it meets it Its
filled up and its now making its way up the
stairs towards the top of the temple So  to
 anyone
 All right
 And roll for Yasha
  to 
  to ten
 Guys

 All right Ten to five
 Nott and then Cad
 Caleb and Jester
 Then Fjord at the bottom
 Awesome That was my Dante
 Thats okay it just means you guys are now
in the process of slowly drowning
 It is
 Well since theyre not officially in this
Now that we are in combat
 There is the nature
 Caduceus just made his way up there Theres
Beau and theres Jamedi
 Top of the initiative order Beau youre up
first While youre in water movement is
considered difficult terrain If I recall attacks
are made at disadvantage while in water
 Those are the stairs that lead upward yes
 Yeah thats an option
 That is entirely an option you can do
 There were holes above but they were in the
ceiling and they were part of the stonework Up
top there was an actual trapdoor that you had
locked behind you
 No
 That you know of There are holes above
which is where the sacrificial blood would drip
through into the fountain So what are you doing
guys Are you running first
 Youre swimming
 
 Beau is also
 No shes not out of the temple Shes
heading up the stairs Shes out of the battle for
the moment
 So that finishes Beaus turn It is now
their turn They both rolled really high
initiative and you guys rolled really terribly
The malisons closest are going to
 He is
 Well hes still within  feet of you So
at the top of his turn he takes the save
 All right Natural  on its save so it
takes half damage It still takes damage
 So nine This burst of radiant energy
inside  Theres bubbles that escape
from its mouth Its going to come forward and
take two swipes at you Fjord with both of its
serpent hands
 All right That is a  to hit
 And a natural  but it has disadvantage
because its in water That is still a  to hit
 You do manage to take from one serpent
you just manage to glide out of the way in the
middle of the water The second one that is four
plus three seven piercing damage including ten
points of poison damage
 Yeah
 Unfortunately no because its straight
from the fangs in your bloodstream It surges pain
in your chest You also lose a bit of air
instinctively from the pain So consider now
your air supply is halved
 Essentially the DC is going higher when we
start getting to that depending on how long were
down here
 That ends his go Now its the two
broodguards
 Broodguards
 Theyre both already within the radius so
they both have to make wisdom saves
 At the top of the turn Its a different
turn so roll again
 No its the top of their turn it happens
 Sorry Spirit Guardians happens at the top
of the turn it doesnt happen immediately
 Yeah at the top of their turn So the
damage they wouldve taken this turn theyve
already taken So well let that happen Marking
that down Good to remember They both move
forward One broodguard is going to attack you
Nott
 Its going to do two claw attacks and a bite
attack
 Disadvantage on each though The first one
is a 
 One claw attack just goes wide The other
one 
 One claw You manage to duck under one The
other one slams into the side of your body
pushing you through the water and down into the
stonework causing your hip to hit the side
Thats going to do four points of slashing damage
This giant serpentine mouth out of its weird
lizardlike body is going to strike out and bite
you Oh two tens Thats  to hit
 You manage to push up and jam your hand up
into its jaw and keep it from biting you and push
it away The other ones going up towards Yasha
Yasha was not raging So the first one with
disadvantage is  to hit
  hits Its going to be a claw attack
Ooh eight points of slashing damage
 Next attack with a claw with disadvantage
natural one That is a complete miss Yasha takes
one claw and  barely affects it The
other one she grabs its hand in the middle of the
grasp and pushes it back She grabs her sword
ready now As she is going to get her blade ready
its going to bite towards the front of her jaw
and chest That is 
 She takes six points of piercing damage
 That ends the broodguards turn Yashas up
next
 Yashas also lost quite a bit of air on that
turn Those two hits that hit her Mark down two
hits of oxygen loss on her
 Keeping tabs on this This will come into
play in a bit depending on what happens
 Shes right there
 Shes in melee with the broodguard yes
 Shes in a rage She has the reckless
 Okay so that just makes it a straight
attack because she has disadvantage underwater
 Definitely hits
 Yeah hits Thats just d
 That ones looking really bad After the
blasts that it took from the Spirit Guardians and
the two strikes from Yasha you can see now
theres a cloud of dark crimson in the water
around it Its thrashing about in pain You can
see it looking a bit woozy in the dark water That
finishes Yasha You going to move at all
 She can move around it As long as she stays
in melee she can still move around
 I got you Thats what I figured That
finishes Yashas turn Notts up next
 You had shot this one
 You can drop it for the moment fire it and
pick it back up
 Ill let that happen
 Because there is water and its already
soaking Its like 
 Ill say narratively it makes sense
 Melee spell attack
 With disadvantage yes
  hits
 AC is 
 Eight points of damage to it As you reach
out and grab it  You watch as
its tongue retracts into its head and its eyes go
wide  It loses some air and it
eventually shakes and pushes off your hand
 You can do it but you lose a bunch of air
to do it
 Yes you do
 This is as far as you can get
 Swimming over
 That is your go Nott It is now Caduceus
Caleb and Jester You guys can decide amongst
yourselves the order
  That gets you about there
 Youre right about there on the steps
 Swimming through the air Okay that
finishes Calebs go Whats Jester doing
 Shes engaged with this broodguard right
there
 Thats a saving throw for him Whats the
save
 That is a  That does not do it
 d I think
 Hes already taken damage
 Casting the spells a bonus action
 Right so yeah youd be up there
 There you go Thank you for the heads up on
that
 Ten points Oof Yeah hes not looking good
either Theyre both looking pretty rough
 She is currently Both of you since you
cast spells mark five points of lost air
 For the purposes of this challenge to keep
it interesting five points before youre now
starting to make is now considered how long you
can hold your breath going forward
 Each hits a minute off the Ill have to
look at how I worked it out here Essentially at
this point now Jester and Nott are going to have
to start making constitution saving throws each round
 That finishes Jesters go She moves around
over there behind the side Caduceus whatre you doing
 Blight staff swing
 Disadvantage on the attack
 Okay so youre going to swim up on top of
the fountain
 Is that all youre doing
 Okay ends Caduceus go Fjord youre up
 No Its two Eldritch Blasts or two
strikes
 Go for it Roll for attack with
disadvantage
  hits Roll damage on him
 Nine points of damage all righty
 Still up Hurt but still up
 Go for it
  hits again Roll damage
  points of damage Thatll do it You hear
the dull impact of the Eldritch Blast and the
second  under the water In that flash of
light that second sickly green glow flash in the
water one of the broodguards begins to float up
limply towards the ceiling no longer alive
 That will get you right about there on the
stairs There you go thatll do Youll swim
right there thats perfect It does get to swipe
at you with disadvantage Thats going to be nine
plus five thats 
 It does It scrapes across your shield as
you swim away quickly just barely making it That
finishes your turn Fjord Beau youre up
 Youre going up the staircase but youre
part way up
 Yeah still filling and its still above
you like you can maybe catch up to the top if you
want to If you use your full movement youll get
up to the top where the door is
 Downstairs you mean
 You tie take the crowbar and throw it
behind so its like  and rolls partway
down the stairs
 Okay with that youll make it all the way
to the top You get to the small inner chamber
which is now halfway to stomachfilled Making it
to the top you look up and you can see there is
its a little bit crouchdown there is the latch
and there is the lock mechanism beneath it
 Yeah You locked it behind you when you guys
entered the temple
 Somebody found the key It was on one of the
guys from the first encounter of this chamber
 Well its their turn now The malison going
to make its saving throw Thats going to be a 
Whats the DC
  So roll full damage on that d
  points of damage Ooh hes looking
really bad
 When it comes to their turn One of thems
dead now
 The other two their turns next Well get
to that when he finishes his turn but one of them
is dead so theres only one other guy
 The malison in a burst of angry pixies
swarming around his body is looking really hurt
As he moves around the trail of blood stays in
the water behind the head as it shifts around
Both of the serpent arms look up towards Caduceus
the source of these angry spirits and is going to
make two strikes against him
 Because youre the one right there That is
 to hit
 Second strike thats a 
 Its like  six  eight Bad rolls
Both serpent strikes from its arms reach out
towards you and Caduceus youre tiny enough
right now Although are you still holding the
tiny spell on Caduceus
 Is Expeditious Retreat concentration
 Okay so youre regular form and you bear
down with the shield and deflect both
 Bits of green and pinkish lichen torn off
and float away in the water away from the strikes
That finishes its go The other broodguard has to
make another save that is a seven plus no that
does not make it so full damage on the other
broodguard
 No actually
  points of damage thatll do it
 This guy also sparks and dies in the water
 Thats Caduceus spell That finishes their
go Yashas up
 Okay Got you  Then moving the
rest way up that will get her halfway up the
steps Put her there
 Okay Finishing Yashas turn Nott youre
up
 Shades of the kraken battle returning
 Jamedi has essentially just swam around this
whole thing
 Well say for the purposes of this Avantika
has at this point swept up and taken her turn
that she should have taken before and is going to
take three strikes against the malison Thats my
own fault but well see With disadvantage
Thats cocked That still hits because its armor
class is only  Ten points of damage Second
strike with the rapier disadvantage That does
not hit The dagger strike no Misses again
Swinging out piercing through the water with the
rapier and the dagger and just to scrape across
the side of its body but most of the strikes go
wide and shes swimming around this way
 No shes still staying in combat She moved
around him but is staying engaged but is currently
looking to make another opening and then dive off
back towards the stairs Nott sorry your turn now
 At the end of your turn
 You swim up a bit there Go for it
Disadvantage on the attack
  hits and engaged with allies You do get
sneak attack damage
 Yeah Its engaged with Caduceus and
Avantika
 How do you want to do this
 As you do you pierce past all the humanoid
muscles across the neck and its shoulders
Immediately the water before you fills with
crimson You can see it thrash for a minute its
serpent arms trying to reach behind to strike at
you You swim away as they go limp and it begins
to float up So thats that You still have a
little movement left
 That is about as far as you can get With
dash you can get up there so youre with Fjord
Make a constitution saving throw please
 You are not drowning yet but youre on the
cusp
 That ends your go Nott Caduceus Caleb
and Jester youre up
 Shes up with Fjord and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw for Jester
 Caduceus I need you to make one too
because you did cast a spell Spirit Guardians
while underwater
 She rolled nine total Jesters drowning
You see her swimming Shes  and begins
kicking in the water before starting to
 You rolled an eight Caduceus as well They
both swim towards the staircase and you see them
both beginning to clutch at their throats
 You used your full movement to get there
 Next turn youre going to be unconscious
Ending your go Caleb what are you doing
 You can get up to the front there
 It gets you to the last bit of air as its
about to hit the surface At the end of this
combat round basically after Fjord the chamber
that Beau is in is now full The water has filled
the entirety of the temple
 Yes
 You do reach the door
 Okay Make a lock picking attempt
 No disadvantage because youre underwater
 No thats a failure Youre sticking
trying to get through it No effect Fjord youre up
 She is no longer drowning but you have to
make a con save at the end of your turn
 Thats your action to do that You breathe
some of your air into her You still have movement
 You make it halfway up Actually no
because you have full move dont you
 You get almost to the top Not fully but
almost to the top Constitution saving throw please
 You sir are considered drowning
 Yes you do
 Youre fine That brings around to the top
there Beau the water fills the gap
 Okay So youre going to pull Jester up
Shes conscious so youre going to get her closer
 Sure You go down Takes you Ill say two
movements to get down there and you pull her part
way up Are you using your ki point for step of
the wind
 Last ki point will do that That will get
her halfway up the stairs because Im saying
pulling her the dragging motion is half
movement So that will get you down to her Yeah
youll get her part way up the stairs about
halfway up toward where the top chamber is
 It did Okay no I would say that there was
enough air
 Thank you So youre fine Ends Beaus turn
That brings us to Yasha Avantika has also swam up
and Jamedi is now gathering as well Jamedi and
Avantika both grab Caduceus body who is
drowning and begin pulling him up the stairs
behind them
 Yasha gets up there to the top Yashas now
in there waiting there in the chamber Theres
the gate below getting ready looking around
trying to get people to move upward That finishes
her go Nott
 You use half your movement to catch up to
Jester where Beau is and then you grab her with
the little bit of movement You move her an
additional five feet before your movement is done
You can attempt to bonus action dash
 You get another  feet You get her near
the top of the staircase on the top floor That
ends your turn Nott Now it is Jesters Calebs
and Caduceus turn Caduceus You are unconscious
 I need you to make a death save at the top
of your turn I need to keep reminding myself that
death saves are at the top of the turn not in
the
 Success on the save That finishes Caduceus
turn Caleb and Jester
 Between all of you guys Jester and you all
manage to make your way up the top and Jesters
turn Jester fumbles through her sack pulls up
the key and gets it So
 This is how the ending of the first Poseidon
movie should have happened

 Because all of this water pressure just
built up at the top of this temple suddenly
released as the latch and this geyser of water
thrusts all of you rapidly out the top
 You all get shot about a good   feet
up
 You have a look down at the temple which
you can now see these large cracks that have set
in the sides where bits of water are pouring out
through small cracks Now this large geyser thrusts
in the air and you all began to plummet and fall
 Okay
 Perfect
 As you all begin to drift down the geyser
slows the pressure releases but now water is
just pouring out of the sides of the temple and
its completely flooding the city You watch as
yuanti that are rushing up the side of the temple
are washed down into the basin that is now the
center of the city streets You can see now that
the city is being thrust up the side Some have
moved to the top of buildings and are glancing up
and seeing you guys as you begin to descend Now
youre about to hit the top of this and there is
now a perpetual flow of water coming out of the
top of this temple What are you going to do
 On the sides of it You guys are just slowly
drifting down towards whats essentially a raging
 Rapid water slide on all ends
 Correct
 Okay
 Yeah
 No because we havent gone to his turn yet
Youve begun drowning and you guys got thrust out
so you managed just catch your breath because it
didnt come back to your turn yet That very next
turn before Jester got it opened youve would
have been down
 So you just caught your breath
 The very last minute Basically as the
darkness began to take your vision you are thrust
out and your eyes go wide again as you see this
sunlight above you as your air rushes back into
your lungs and then suddenly begin to drift slowly
down looking below you can see the city and the
entire landscape of this strange village below
you
 So what are you guys doing
 They are on all sides Like the entire city
surrounds the temple You guys only came up on one
side The water is pouring down on all sides
 Any spells thats concentration is lost
 Okay So as you all begin to slowly drift
and try paddling your way through the air Im
going to say for the purpose of this well make
this a group skill check Everyone make a
dexterity check to try and comb your way through
the air enough Using your body to try and guide
your plummeting
 Two successes failure
 Youre fine
 Success Three successes one failure
Jester
 Success on Jester For Yasha
 Success all right So only one fail As a
group that is a group success So you all manage
to just Yep and both Jamedi and Avantika are
fine So you all manage to just barely push your
way in a certain direction you all begin to drift
down
 Yeah slowly making your way through until
eventually the surface of the water the rushing
sound gets louder and louder as you all strike it
As you do it carries you down in this rapid
Gooniesstyle waterslide youre all coasting down
the side of the stones and elements of the stone
just barely scraping and clipping the back of your
butt and your back and youre like Oh god its
not enough to damage you but youre going to be
bruised as shit in the morning but youre
coasting down you can see as the city is coming
towards you the water is now pouring through and
snaking through the city no pun intended there
are groups of yuanti that have clamored up onto
the buildings and are currently trying to pull
themselves out of the water and help others get up
out of the middle of this strange flood that has
taken over the center of their civilization
 Its still pouring out of the temple it
seems
 Orlys vengeance
 You guys coast down you hit the bottom and
you can see now where the water hits and it snakes
through it curves back to the right and the left
which path are you going to try to guide towards
 You have an unconscious sledding furbolg
 You do its like 
 Its almost like curling
 Yes you would so youre guiding and
shouting directions
 Calebs guiding you guys you guys move
around the side riding the water At this point
the flood of water begins to subside a bit Its
still guiding you through but you can see now the
initial burst and rushing of the rapids is not a
continuous thing there is some sort of a tapering
to it You guys just managed to have been there
for the initial burst At this point you guys
coast around one side come round and youre now
going down to the center of the street where you
previously hid and basically like muscled two of
them into a doorway after stabbing and killing
them rapidly Youre now gliding through the
street along with the flow of the water trying to
keep above the surface Caduceus being pushed
along by little Nott going  At this
point from one of the nearby building tops you
see two of these centurion yuanti see you guys
pass beneath begin giving out a call and then
shouting over in their direction pointing towards
you Your presence is now aware to at least a
handful of nearby yuanti Their weapons were
either lost in the stream or not wielded of
course but theyre beginning to pull out their
things You guys continue to ride this forward
youre leading the path the way you can go I
need everybody to make a general acrobatics check
to try and guide their body through the water in
the direction that Caleb is shouting This is a
group check
 Those count as double successes
 Still good
 You guys got this shit like I dont even
yeah youre just out
 I think what did she roll
 Ill say with that higher roll shes been
able to make her way over towards the side of you
guys coasting along
 All righty so Jester just manages to just
make it over to the edge of you as the water
which was about maybe with the flash flood about
three and a half four feet deep is now
descending to about two foot So some of you your
feet manage to catch the floor beneath but the
water is still rushing rather fast you can
continue to just go with the flow of it or try
and gather your footing but its up to you You
can cast Cure Wounds on Caduceus
 A d plus
 So go to roll d plus your wisdom modifier
Sorry d for Cure Wounds
 Youre at five hit points you come into
consciousness on a sled over water
 Yes when youre drowning it brings you to
zero hit points
 Riding the water eventually you guys manage
to keep it going Are you going with the water or
are you fighting it
 Mostly yeah
 So you just continue with the flow of it
the flow eventually comes to a stop on the outside
of the city maybe about  or  feet from the
treeline where you first entered
 Okay
 As a note all the makeup has been washed
off
 Sorry As you guys are rushing towards the
treeline you hear the shouting in the distance
You glance over now that the water level has
stopped you can look behind and you can see
probably two dozen or so yuanti have now begun to
give chase Theyre about a hundred feet behind
you but they saw you exit and theyre on their
way giving chase Now were turning this into a
skill challenge chase as you guys are making your
way through As you guys are now charging into the
jungle youre not doing stealth so your speed
isnt as slow which took you a day and a half or
so to traverse this jungle to the center unless
you want to keep stealthy if its charging through
 Full speed great We have six rounds of
this challenge
 Correct success and failure do different
things Who wants to offer something to help in
this skill challenge Much like the resurrection
challenge in this game think of a creative way
that you can help your progression
 It depends on what you want to do
 Youre still under  minutes yes
 Okay I will say for that make a survival
check with advantage
 Thats one thats two successes on that
one Well add to that So keeping a close eye
Caleb is darting ahead into the jungle shouting
out various issues Jamedi is trying to keep up
with you but behind is also helping you keep an
eye and shouting out traps that he had helped you
bypass before and making sure you guys dont fall
off the path that you had made your way through
that he had set on his map beforehand that had
avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle Between
the two of you you manage to get a fair bit in
there and the sound of the chasing yuanti does
not seem to be getting louder which is good
Thats one who does the next offer
 Okay Yasha going to push at the front
which with a higher speed than you she can
definitely do and begin to carve through swarths
of the jungle to make it an easier passage For
her make an athletics check please
 Straight up unless shes raging
 Okay Ill allow that for this
 Thats a success Yashas now ahead of the
group shes carving through you can see there
are bits when you come up to the front where
there is just dense clusters of tangled vines
where the path you are taking Caleb stops you at
the front because you deviated a little from the
path where you were because you were running too
fast At this point youre not used to this level
of acceleration for an extended period of time
Right at the end of your Expeditious Retreat
right as the spell is about to fade you come to
that group of vines At that point youre about to
spin and warn everybody and all you see is this
blur of Yasha carve through them They all fall to
the ground the path before you is open she goes
Go All of you just keep running in that
direction Yashas continuing that whos taking
the next bit
 Yeah rumble of thunder you can do it has
limitations to the sound you can make but you can
make a rumble of thunder
 Oh such as I misunderstood what youre
saying Yeah there are certain sounds you can
make the sound of a whole group
 Okay so rustling in the bushes it makes
sense
 Make a deception check
  Thats just barely a success
 All right so with that you hear the
chanting sounds the war cry of yuanti behind
you and it begins to divert slightly getting
them off track just a little bit All right whos
taking the next bit Who hasnt offered one
 Theres six stages of this
 From what you can tell not at the moment
but if you wanted to use your turn to do something
to see if somebody is What do you want to do
Your crit earlier gave a lower DC for the next
check so that helped out tremendously
 Okay As a note youre in a lush jungle
Probably not going to do much on this thats a
hard smooth floor type scenario I mean you can
if you want to
 No not at the moment
 You have a second level spell to use
 The glove Yeah you do Thats right okay
 Okay this is a combined maneuver here Id
say for the success of this this is going to be a
combination of your make a roll with your ranged
spell attack
 Yeah you can go ahead and make a general
strength roll
 Nice roll Okay you manage to lob it behind
with a fair amount of strength so it goes about
ten  feet behind you
 Okay it does a little whirl It 
through the air and bounds a bit into the jungle
behind you
 Are you detonating it just   feet
behind you Or are you waiting for something else
to come out
 Correct but theyre not visible yet though
you dont know where you are
 Okay what did you roll
 You do
 What was the second one Sorry  and 
were the two highest
 Got you okay So the two hit so roll
damage The damage is going to be important here
because it is a waterlogged container of black
powder and may not be enough to truly ignite or
cause an explosion here or burn through the
barrel Well see
 Its intact yeah but its wet
 Its soaked through a little bit
 This isnt a beer barrel
 Thatll be enough All right so as it darts
behind you watch the vision of Caleb spinning
behind and releasing the glove in front with these
three arcs of flame One of them hits a nearby
bush and sets it aflame The other two one of
them hits the barrel and sends it arcing once
more and the second one hits it detonates and
you guys feel this blast of hot wind behind you as
your hair gets blown before your face The entire
jungle around you lights for a moment with bright
yellowwhite light and there in that space now is
a couple of trees that have now set aflame and a
section of darkened crater on the ground where the
barrel was The loud blast echoes across the
jungle of the island around you
 Ill consider that a success You guys keep
rushing You assume wherever the yuanti were
theyre a little unsettled by this large explosion
in the direction of where theyre travelling and
it slows them down a bit as they try and coast
around the area where the damage is However
there seems to be a lizardmen hunting party now
that is in the jungle a little ways ahead of you
 You guys have been running for the better
part of two hours now its a ways through this
jungle to get back to the shore So first and
foremost I need everyone here to go ahead and
make a constitution saving throw please
 Good
 Okay
 You take a point of exhaustion there
Caleb
 Just barely succeeded
 One point of exhaustion
 All right youre fine
 Avantika takes a point of exhaustion
 All right You guys continue onward since
youre just running through this jungle best you
can full sprint it manages to keep ahead but
there is a threat of exhaustion as you continue to
move So you now begin to hear the sound this
familiar clacking  sound of the
lizardmen that you saw in the jungle before Whos
doing what
 Youre still doing it You had four total
successes in the round you had one critical
success which improved
 You dont see them there but you hear them
in the direction you are Apparently the noise and
the explosion caught the attention of a nearby
lizardmen hunting party
 So youre doing the exact same thing with a
different item Its going to have a higher DC but
you can do it Its your call
 Im just saying its something you can do
You want to do it
 No no its a great suggestion Im just
letting you know progressively doing the same
thing over and over again its going to continue
to raise the DC
 Its a cantrip Cantrips dont have all that
power there
 There you go Anybody else
 Okay
 Two lizardfolk in the group now all right
 Doesnt have to be abilities it can be just
whatever you think you would do in the area to help
 You heard the hunting call of them
 Yes somewhere in the front and to the right
of where you were as you guys were running through
the jungle
 Okay are you guys stopping for Nott then
 Okay
 Yes you do with advantage because of your
cloak
 Okay so you are successfully stealthed
this is not technically a success because this
isnt actually helping the endeavor but you do
manage to move ahead and at your speed you come
upon the hunting party You can see now there are
about six lizardmen with nets shields and spears
that are currently making their way in the
direction of near where your party is currently
waiting for you The more time that passes the
closer the yuanti get to your party
 Four of them have shields and spears and
two of them have spears with nets and the other
ones have nets apparently tucked behind their
back Theyre out here to catch and drag things back
 Okay make an arcana check
 Yes This is to see if you can influence the
magical nature of your cantrip strong enough to
try and trip up one of them
 Okay thats barely a success because thats
not a very effective plan necessarily
 One of them gets tripped up in the net and
the other ones look back at it and start clacking
at it and theyre complaining about the one guy
that fell behind like an asshole and is slowing
down their trajectory Not a lot of distraction
You can return you figure you bought a little bit
of time for your party but not much
 Okay
 Okay
 You all continue following Caleb They are
now seemingly turning on you 
 All right Youre darting through the
jungle
 Kind of in the adjacent direction
 Okay no worries Theyre giving chase
theyre following behind you they know this
jungle very well and can traverse it very easily
However youre quick and youre small For that
well say two of them throw ranged spears at you
Thats a  to hit
 And a  nope Both spears  to the
nearby trees and you keep running trying to make
it through Eventually you hear the sound of
 Yeah  as youre going You hear
the footfalls breaking through of nearby brush and
glance over afraid to see yuanti and you can see
the shapes of your group maybe  or  or so
feet to your left
 Not at the moment you guys are just
running I mean the lizardmen you knew were off
to the front and right and you guys darted at an
angle and youre guiding them still in the
direction toward the
 No
 Yeah you havent seen any of the yuanti
youve gotten enough gain on them but theyve
gotten a bit closer but they havent appeared
yet
 No youre just
 Correct
 You guys continue to run continue to run
continue to run Everyone make another
constitution saving throw please
 Yasha takes a point of exhaustion Fjord
barely succeeds DC goes up by two every time we
do this
  Success Secondary point of exhaustion
your speed is now halved
 Caleb is now winded and now starting to
drag the group back a bit
 Ten point of exhaustion Caduceus
 Anyone who has one point of exhaustion your
ability checks are at disadvantage right now
 Two points your speed is halved
 I will make this one of your checks
 Make an athletics check
 You have disadvantage because
 Okay so you share the idea with Yasha
Yashas going to attempt to
 Does Yasha have a point of exhaustion
 So disadvantage on her athletics check
 One second please because this is going to
attribute to her
  Thats a success
 That puts us at six total successes
 across the checks here Yasha throws Caleb
firemancarry over the shoulder and you guys begin
running and running and running For this next
additional hour now as you guys are charging
through following the path well say youve gone
three or four hours of straight sprint through the
forest Sprint stop run Youre breathing heavy
youre sweating profusely your body is aching
your mouth is just filled with the worst
cottonmouth youre dehydrated You can hear the
yelping of approaching lizardmen and yuanti as
you see the light begin to slowly break ahead of
you through the trees as the treeline begins to
thin and the faintest bit of blue is visible
Within a few more moments you break through the
treeline and youve found yourself back to the
white sand beaches of Urukaxl There as you come
out to the sand the hot reflection of the sun
against the light You can see now the sun is
close to setting at this point the sky itself has
gotten slowly darker as youve moved past The
white beaches have now come to a faint dull yellow
and orange with the coming sunset light Nott
emerges from the nearby brush
 Shes catching up with the rest of you
guys
 You guys look and there are the two rowboats
that are still right where you left them
 Okay I will say roll an arcana check for
me
 Unfortunately as a cantrip the perpetual
fiery quality of it it can do bursts of damage
and plops of flame but unfortunately the treeline
here is too humid the air here is too wet and
none of the trees are catching However you
manage to get over Yasha throws you onto one of
the two rowboats you guys get on too At this
point you can now see breaching one side of the
treeline the yuanti the other side a group of
lizardmen They come to a head and look at each
other and look at you Half of each group charges
at each other
 while the other half begins to charge
towards the rowboats
 Theyre about  feet away its a  foot
rush
 Theyre going to catch up You guys push
off and youre rowing out youre about ten now
 or  feet off the edge they catch up they
start getting their shortbows ready At this
point you hear 
  Bursts of sand columns of
sand go flying into the air and you watch as one
lizardman  a yuanti bursts off to the
side You look over you can see the flashes of
light on the sides of the Squalleater
 as volley after
volley of cannon fire is blown towards the edge of
the shoreline A couple close calls as its not a
perfect aiming implement You see as you dodge
out of the way as  big burst of water
Some of the yuanti dive into the water and are
now swimming through trying to come back you
can see their serpentine bodies making their way
in your direction
 Hitting in the water as you do
 Eventually you guys get far enough away
from the edge it becomes less advantageous for
them to focus on you and than to focus each other
Through the cacophony of explosions and the rest
are wrestling the much larger force of both the
lizardpeople that live on this island and the
yuanti that have given chase are now focused on
each other and this conflict is now spilling back
into the jungle and away from the beach As you
all very sore make your way towards the
Squalleater and now you can see offshore The
Mist or The Mistake has also been pulled off the
shore seemingly repaired enough to be at least
semiserviceable though its only been a day or
so and the repairs probably arent longhaul
permanent but for the first time in a very very
long time this day you all take a deep breath
some of you taking a short nap as you row
yourself to the sunset over the distant far shores
of the ocean towards the ships that mean safety
and thats where were going to take a break

 Okay then damn

congratulations
 Well get this vault sent out to you ASAP

 All right
 Nope
 Because youre rowing to the ship and
theres still the occasional  of the
final shots sent off to deflect any interest in
following or pursuing you towards the boats As
you guys are trying to make some distance here
you look over at Avantika who has her one
ungloved hand you can see the gap where the open
wound theres just a little bit of blood
trickling down her forearm where the eye once was
She looks at it closes her fist closes her eyes
and you feel the rowboat suddenly pick up speed
and you watch as the water and the waves now give
an additional thrust like the ocean itself is
rising and pushing the boat forward and you watch
Avantika open her eyes and smile and looks over at
Fjord and goes Well better luck next time
huh The boat is now speedboating across the
surface of the water the other rowboat left
behind in its wake
 One die roll
  As you approach the outskirts of
the Squalleater The rope ladders are thrown over
the edge down into the water With that you all
eventually climb up onto the top as some of the
crew goes over to retrieve and ratchet up and
bring the rowboats back onto the ship Now you all
clamber onto the deck of the large ship and take a
moment of respite and breather as your the crew
of the Squalleater there awaits You can see there
Bouldergut the large ogre chief stands there arms
crossed with the stretched leather tunic now
strapped on each side of her torso Avantika rises and
Vera waits her righthand soothsayerlike
assistant or for this would be considered the
deckhand and spiritual leader of this ship
 Yes you may
 I took mine off
  Thats true if there was any of
us I would not be able to truly
 be certain
 Yeah

 Its okay So as you all bring yourselves
onto the ship here Vera approaches Avantika and
helps her to her feet and says like So how did
it go Tell us Avantika shows her hand Twas a
resounding success I would say that our new
compatriots have proven their worth with flying
colors She goes and gives a  ow ow
ow ow ow

 And I do believe You see Jamedi sitting
on the ground and goes Yes You have earned
what our contract assured you Please Vera if
you could retrieve the payment Vera leaves and
in a moment comes back with a small chest and
hands it over to Jamedi who sets it into his
pouch and satchel He stands up for a second nods
his head I hope you understand that with all
due respect this is our last time working
together The Captain says Aye I understand
but it is your loss There is always more work for
you Where would you like to be dropped off
 At this point Vera says Captain at this
moment it appears that we have maybe  days of
supplies given that our crew has now swelled As
such we could probably make it back to Darktow to
also complete the repairs on The Mist as it is
seaworthy but I do not know how long So that
would be my recommendation Maybe making a stop or
two along the way whatevers close by The
captain considers Very well I guess well make
our way westward onto Darktow to get repairs done
to supply up and should you wish to stay make
our way to the next leg of our journey Who knows
It seems that you are up for your own rewards to
be reaped eh
 Of course Well these gifts are paltry
Once Ukotoa is truly free then the true blessing
can be given
 I have a lead on someone that should be in
Darktow that would be able to with the right
amount of coin give us the information we seek
Hopefully If not well be sitting here with our
thumbs up our asses but Ive paid well enough
and this person has come through before so
fingers crossed eh
 Regardless I think we could all use a bit
of rest eh Looks over to Caduceus
 Understood Get Jeremiah to get food
cooking immediately I think a fine meal and a
full nights rest is in order Friends Im
impressed and Im thankful that youve not only
upheld your side of the bargain you proved
yourselves as quite formidable mercenaries I mean
no disrespect to some of my crew but when we get
back to Darktow She looks at some of the crew
Turn around Some of them Maybe well deal
with some trade off eh Send some of them over to
The Mist and maybe youll stay with me for a
while
 Very well Then we will get some sleep and
on the morrow we will discuss how much money we
can make together Well probably make a stop or
two along the way if youre interested Bring up
the map and see what you want to do When weve
had a bit of rest maybe a glass of wine
 All right Go rest sleep I shall do the
same She walks back into her quarters Vera
staying there on the deck Jamedi makes his way
down to his quarters What would you like to do
 You can find a bit that seems a little more
remote but there are deckhands there are folks
that are always keeping watch
 You come to Jeremiah You eventually start
shouting until you find Jeremiah Jeremiah is this
mids halfling fellow Pale but welldressed in
colorful silks and vibrant makeup From some of
the theater productions youve seen he seems
almost made up for the stage but just a cook Big
smile big curled waxed mustache hair parted and
curled on the sides light brown auburn hair
Portly halfling fellow and as youre shouting his
name he goes Hello Are you looking for me
 Im Jeremiah Whats your name
 Beau yes Youre one of the new kids I am
making food Would you
 Fine here you go He hands over a
somewhat stale loaf
 No they are being prepared and I wish not
to serve something that is unfinished
  Grabs a thing of wine a small jar
and says You can fetch your own water
 All right You guys patiently wait for Beau
to return with a stale
 It was just sitting in a pool of water and
you found that amongst other piles It seemed to
be less of a temple and more of a scavenged
artifact amongst a merrow den that was expanding
beneath the swamp
 Roll a history check
 This would be history technically
Actually history or religion
 You recall tales I mean there are many
powerful creatures that have existed throughout
history entities that are either elemental in
nature or are primal forces of power There are
some that are guardians of the world some that
are guardians of the elements within their own
planes There are many types of horrors and
protectors throughout history Thinking back to
some of your studies both historically and in
cracking the tome of the occasional religious
thing against your better will in your classes
there are some entities that were left in the wake
least creations that were meant to be an extension
of the power of the gods Some of them are
guardians in the world some of them still remain
true to the religions or the gods that created
them Some over time have found their own
interests Some have grown obsessed with their own
power without their creator and master to chastise
or watch over them and see themselves as a new
god even Thinking back you dont have all the
information but you do know that thinking back
to the murals and things youve heard about
Ukotoa being said Ukotoa was worshipped by the
KiNau which were the indigenous people of the
Menagerie Coast and the Swavain Islands in the
vicinity Ukotoa was one of these avatar entities
that was created by Zehir the Cloaked Serpent to
be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of
its greatest warriors in the conflict of the
Calamity
 Essentially When Zehir and the rest of the
betrayer gods were banished along with the other
prime deities they were now the most powerful
beings on the surface of Exandria As such new
religions began to spring up around them The
KiNau of this area took to worshipping Ukotoa
and Ukotoa began to preside like the next best
god there was You get the sense that these other
powerful beings created before or during the
Calamity and then left with their gods now sealed
away to become forces of power of their own You
dont know if theyve been sealed in the same fate
that Ukotoa was But based on what you saw in
that temple they seem to be connected or at
least have similar structure of worship
 If you were to find a place of deep
research you could probably find more information
about these entities yes
 Yasha puts her hand on your shoulder and
says Faith is a funny thing Be careful where
you place it It can give strength or it can lead
to terrible things
 Fuming
 So you guys all go to rest
 All right You guys go to rest
 You head your way to the captains
quarters
 All right You head to the door Its
closed  For a moment you hear this
sound of rushing water
 Okay it opens up Its the normal office
den set up but theres the balcony out back that
opens up and there on the balcony Avantika is
standing on the balcony and theres this column of
water that is rising up out of the ocean Shes
nude Its washing her Shes in the process in
the throes of manipulating this water Shes
learning whatever this new gifted power that she
has Her hair is twirling up into the stream and
its this beautiful almostdance between her and
this elemental force that she now has She looks
back over her shoulder at you knowing that youve
been there for at least a couple minutes Ill be
just a moment
 Eventually the water splashes down and off
the side She walks back out of the night air and
pulls her hair up and ties it off
 She takes a little silk robe and places it
over her and sits down There are already two
glasses places on the table She uncorks it and
pours two glasses
 To our success in time eh
 This is true Not the best wine youve
had but its serviceable
 I am excited for you to experience this
 Ive only but scratched the surface and
Ive never felt a connection like this with the
sea that has been my life Its incredible I can
only do it in bursts but I can cause it to swell
and move and part and flood and shift Its
 Soon She reaches out and touches the
top of your hand Soon I promise Now we were
talking before and I think its only fair She
takes another big sip Your blade is very
interesting I knew one other who had a blade very
similar Referred to it as the Sword of Fathoms
 The previous chosen
 His name was Vandren
 A fine sailor and a foolish coward he ended
up to be but he was the one that opened my eyes
to the destiny of Ukotoa We traveled together
for a number of years before he just abandoned and
absconded with something important Ive been
trying to find out where he went but he is very
slippery Wherever he is either what you have in
your sword is what he took away or wherever he is
he has the third with him
 He carried the same blade
 It is very much in our interests We were
going to go and visit this very island some time
ago when he was the only one to have one of these
orbs
 Well I had to kill a number of men It
was being auctioned off in Port Damali and there
was a collector Word had gotten to us that this
artifact was sold off to this individual Well
needless to say he put up a bit of a struggle
 Thankfully this collector enjoyed nights
long at sea and that happens to be our specialty
His corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful
islands and now I have this beautiful reminder
The hand you can see its now mostly healed
over but there is a scar where this orb once
resided in her palm
 As youre pacing she talks towards you
Its very interesting that you carry the same
blade as Vandren did and come to me with what
could very well be the same orb Do you know this
one This Vandren
 Make a deception check
 Hmm
 Who else was on this ship with you
 Who was your captain
 She smiles I appreciate that you are a
very accomplished liar But so am I The only
reason why I still sit here before you with the
dozen or so scars I carry is because I have been
very keen at seeing through the same skill
 You know Vandren dont you
 And he was on this ship that you
shipwrecked on eh Do you remember where this
storm was
 Do you remember where the storm was
 That sunk the ship you were on
 This was the last time you saw Vandren
 I dont necessarily I have not seen
Vandren since he absconded with this many
things But he will not travel with both that
sword you carry and the orb he stole from us So
wherever that ship has sunken theres a very good
chance that it has the third missing orb Do you
remember where the ship sunk
 She reaches out and pulls out a map and
rolls it out on the table in before you Put your
map up
 Yes
 You do recall actually It was somewhere
coming back along this trade route and somewhere
in this space the storm had blown through This is
where it sank and you washed up
 Darktows over here You washed up on this
island here
 You guys are over there at Urukaxl You
washed up over here so the storm was in this vicinity
 Then my friend I think we are going to do
even more amazing things together
 I have been patient this long I can be
patient a bit further Very well She leans
forward with the wine glass very close and goes
Its been a very long day I think rest is in order
 She takes a big long drink of wine sets it
down Well there are ways to complete a hopeful
future pact together Many different ways

 Man all right
 Quickly her hand grabs the back of your
head and pulls you in
 Shes a very powerful woman and you find
yourself very quickly overpowered You are allowed to

 For the sake of brevity Not the most
restful evening youve had but an evening is had
 No Im never going to do that in a game
Sure go for it then Thats your own
  No No
 I wouldnt call it a romantic evening but a
very
 Union of two business partners of a similar
goal
 And we fade to black
 You do fall asleep together
 Unless you choose to not wish to
 I know
 Roll a stealth check
 All right You carefully and quietly tiptoe
your way through the hallway to your assigned
quarters of which you are sharing with whom
 One eye slowly opens as you are keen to be
somewhat aware living alone out in the
dangerous wood to any sort of aberrant noise in
the vicinity You hear the faint creak of very
gentle footsteps as Fjord makes his way into your
chambers
 You Yeah

 As you all rest a long rest at sea as the
Squalleater and The Mistake make their way towards
Darktow to the far west well end tonights game
there and pick up there next week
 Also everyone levels up Everyones level
seven now

 To that degree while I have you guys here
lets roll some hit points for those who are present
 Over the next couple of days you will
because this is a multiday travel to get to
Darktow so your points of exhaustion will be gone
by the time it matters
 Its your head man
 We reroll ones for hit points
 Its better
 There you go Nott
 I reroll ones for hit points because
rolling a one for hit points at a level up is the
fucking worst
 Whatd you get Caleb
 Four more hit points
 Six points to you To be fair you guys have
been rolling fucking great for hit points for many
levels Its time for there to be some balance
 No Take a good one dude
  I rolled good at hit points This
is bullshit Youre so weird Sam
 How does it feel cheap
 But I reroll ones because I already said
it As a player its the worst feeling Two sucks
still but it doesnt suck as much as a one
Thats how I do it
 All right guys Were not going to sit here
and subject you guys to us leveling up at the
table although Im sure there are a few that
would love to see it We got the important part
out for you guys Well pick up here next week to
see whats in store for the company of the
Squalleater of which the Mighty Nein have joined
The union of partnership of Captain Avantika and
Fjord and the imminent Darktow in your future
  You may have broken me I think it finally
happened I think you finally broke me Im broken
now Im a broken man On that note have a
wonderful night We love you guys and is it
Thursday yet Good night



 Hello everyone and welcome back Last we
escape from the Temple of the False Serpent on the
island of Urukayxl had managed to nearly drown in
the escape make their way through the jungle
being chased by both yuanti and the lizardmen
denizens of this island Making their way to the
shore just in time to have the actual pirate ship
the Squalleater there to defend you Firing
various heavy cannonballs towards the creatures
which had given chase and allowing you to escape
on the boats to safety Upon reaching the top of
the ship you found that the Mistake has been
repaired enough to be seaworthy though it does
need some more intense repairs Your supplies are
relatively low and it looks like the current
goal is to find your journey westward to the island
of Darktow which has been wiped from your
knowledge wiped from the Clovis Concords
control many years ago and currently resides as
the center of all piracy in the Lucidian Ocean As
you all went to rest for the evening Fjord who
will be here shortly so I can continue to
embarrass him had an evenings conversation with
Captain Avantika in which it was discussed his
past history with his childhood father figure who
also seemed to have a history with Avantika as
well and is somehow rolled in with this strange
Ukotoa phenomenon It also came to light that
this shipwreck which gave Fjord his powers might
have a connection based on the Captains
intuition with where this third and final sphere
may lie and it was decided between the two of
them that this may be the next goal beyond
Darktow to pursue After which they fucked
 While that era of the story is transpiring
I want to ask you guys since we have a moment here
 Or in the loose wibblywobbly timeywimey
period of figuring things out as you recover from
the intense return to the ship What would you
like to do Is there anything you want to check up
on First of all everyone leveled up to seven
 This would be the long rest for everyone
but Fjord I guess
 This is that night We will then begin to
embark on what that journey will be but if
theres anything you wish to do before the
evenings done
 We can say this is while Fjord is out
 You get to remove that item and you get to
add it to your
 Pocketed
 It is not magical it is sentimental
 Okay As you reach back into your
waterlogged hood of your coat you hear this tiny
little  and there you pull out this
extremely waterlogged and unhappy crimson weasel

 He pees in your hand
 There are three rooms between the group I
think that have been given to you and the people
that have been moved to the Mistake
 As everyone concludes their evening
activities the journey looking at the map and
the distance is about  miles to Darktow from
Urukayxl
 Yeah essentially The ship normally
 Now its not centered Whatever Its fine
You guys deal with your map Its not mine Its
your map Do what you want Not my responsibility
Your ship is actually traveling faster than it
normally was as part of the blessing that Avantika
received It can achieve about  miles
 No An entire day of travel which is a bit
faster than a general sailing ship which is why
the Mistake can go faster but theyre a pair
Youre looking at about  days of travel
 To Darktow yeah
 Welcome to being on the open seas man
 They dont have bullet trains in DD You
have  days of supplies There will have to be
some sort of supply stop or a way of handling
that
 That is going to make this journey not an
issue when it comes to supplies Look at that
 Divine magic
 You dont have to stop then All right
great
 Not to get to Darktow At Darktow there
will be repairs made to the other ship and
possibly some small repairs to the ship for its
journey and any other supplies you would need
while there Its a  day journey at full speed
During this time a couple of things One you
guys can decide to if you want to learn how to
run a boat
 That being the case we get to decide what
types of skill sets you want to pick up on out
here in the ocean That being the case we have
the quartermaster Quartermaster is the one who
has the most authority other than the captain of
the ship They take over if the captain is unable
to They divvy up plunder or whenever you board a
prized vessel they decide what to take and what
to leave They generally helm that whole process
there as far as pirate ships are concerned There
is the navigator or the sailing master
 You do have Orly hired to do that for you
but Orly can also train one of you to be a backup
in case Orly
 You can both train under him if you want to
You can overlap
 We have the boatswain Boatswain is in
charge of the ship itself You know keeping it in
top shape for travel and battle They handle
looking over the wood the canvas the ropes
making sure that everythings solid and
functional They lead shore parties for supplies
and repairs and oversee activities like dropping
and weighing the anchor setting the sails
cleaning the deck things like that Start
thinking of things you might be interested in
Theres the cooper which makes and maintains
barrels for storage food and water Theres the
carpenter which is the one that actually repairs
the ships structural integrity when it takes
damage They answer to the boatswain They keep
the hull the masts and the yardarms functional
Theres the master gunner who organizes the
placement of shot powder the fuse and aiming the
ships cannons All right so Notts going to
want to train as the master gunner And of
course powder monkey which is the next one below
who basically runs all the stuff
 Powder monkey
 Apprentice as powder monkey and should it
be needed youll become hopefully a good master
gunner Those are the most important aspects
Everyonell learn a little bit about sailing as
you go but start getting an idea if you want to
right now which one of those youd want to
specifically begin to focus on
 Yeah makes sure that all the canvas the
ropes the wood everythings in good condition
 Well find out Train as the boatswain
Which actually to that point the next morning
as everyone begins to go about the first real day
out here in the Lucidian Ocean clear blue sky
with dappled bits of cloud around you the smell
of sea salt and foam and spray making its way as
it splashes across the front of the bow Avantika
catches up to you with Vera being called up to the
side She goes Vera if youd be so kind I
would like to call lets say the utmost members
of the crew please to the deck Maybe some of
your friends as well
 As you all gather on the deck Avantika
goes I appreciate all of the hard work youve
put into this my crew and yours As we are making
our way back it is important that we properly
balance as we endeavor here and make sure that
both training that has been inquired about is
properly disseminated and out of curiosity and
with no disrespect to you Vera I will be
replacing you as the ships quartermaster until we
return to Darktow with our Captain Tusktooth
Vera looks taken aback and briefly offended and
then But of course my captain Quartermaster
time to start paying attention
 She begins to divvy out responsibilities to
the rest of you in the various positions that you
requested to start learning Some elements of the
journey have you moving over to the Mistake some
have you moving back especially for the repairs
elements whoever decides they want to be the
carpenter Unless none of you want to Thats up
to you
 Its up to you
 Makes and maintains barrels
 That is the boatswain
 There we go Note that somewhere on your
character that those are the positions youre
training on this journey All right cooper got
it
 Powder monkey for now
 A few days into this journey well say
because youre training as the carpenter
 Jester the Mistake is keeping in time with
the Squalleater and youre brought it slows down
a bit and youre brought over to the opposite side
and there looking around you wander under the
deck and find at one of the tables Waldok whos
one of the deckhands of the ship Hes currently
sitting at a table with a large tankard of really
rough grog or ale biting his lower lip and he
has his sleeve pulled up and you can see Orly has
this unique bowstring of some kind thats wrapped
between two fingers an inkwell and a needle
thats tied up in it and hes currently halfway
through doing this really goodlooking elaborate
tattoo across the arm of this deckhand
 Hes got his patch over his eye right up
against one of the portholes where the lights
coming through and hes using it for perspective
and hes lording over this smaller thin human
and glances over Oh hey there
 Yeah you keep watch and hes doing this
curled mermaid that is coming up and on one hand
is holding on at the hip and the other is picking
a fruit off of a tree You begin to question the
design a bit and Orly says offhand Its what he
requested
 Hes sitting there going like 
Well I had a rough fight with some scurvy a few
years back and a few things I like the idea of
ladies in the sea that can save me from scurvy
 Orly chuckles under his breath Its very
well done and you can see now the other tattoos
that are across his body were probably done by him
on himself
 I wasnt aware actually but mmmaybe you
should ask around for the man whos doing the
repairs around this place
 I can try and teach you some of
  mmmy skills However I got a specific
talent with some of this here
 Kind of Here do you mmmind The guys
like Uh
 Sure Orly helps show you how he threads
this and gets the needle set up Go ahead and make
a performance check
 Well say dexterity if you really want to
  Picking up where the initial partial ink
sketches were you actually continue to fill in
the rest of the upper torso You do a very good
job You can see where the style does shift in the
art but its not abrasive it just continues and
it is rather nice
 He goes Um no I appreciate that but
no
 He starts to pull his arm away from you
Orly puts his giant tortle hand on your shoulder
and goes I dont recommend mmmessing with the
artistic vision
 There you are
 I like the idea of that Point of order
 Point of order
 You dont happen to have any sort of gem
dust do you
 Yeah
 Oh I have plenty of ink Its mmmore
 Mmmore or less
 I picked up this technique years ago from
some of the individuals that spawned from the
legacy of the island folk It allows me to instill
a mmmighty ink spot As he does that he flexes
his arm and the tattoo shimmies every so slightly
and his muscles bulge a bit
 See its not so much something that can be
easily taught more that its something bequeathed
by an elder
 No
 Well see how time goes by For the time
being just let me know if I can be of service
He talks to you about it and he gives you an
overview of his capabilities For different types
of gem dust he can imbue somebody with a series
of tattoos that can alter elements of their
physical self Its not inexpensive and each
person can only have it once ever so its not
like you can have multiple For  gold worth
of a ruby dust he can imbue a permanent  to strength
 For  gold worth of emerald dust he can
do a permanent  to dex He runs down the stat
sheet there The most expensive ones
constitution thats  worth of diamond dust
There are all the different gem types there He
can also imbue certain resistances Those are more
expensive those are  gold worth of fire opal
dust for fire resist and  gold worth of black
sapphire dust for cold resist He has the
capability of imbuing essentially magical
permanent tattoos
 Yeah thats something
 You can see aspects of based on what
enchantment it is like on Orly his is
specifically an aquamarine dust It has this
faint aquamarine light blue shimmy to it as
soon as the light hits it it glitters across
 Aquamarine dust being the one that boosts
charisma
  Mmmany folk have said that
 Well looks like youre just going to have
to keep me employed for quite a while
 Dont get me hurt He goes back to
finishing up the tattoo on the individual
 That was Waldok
  Okay
 All right
 Roughly eight days into this journey youve
moved about  miles off the shore of the
southern island of Bwuali when a small horn sound
goes off on the Squalleater  Its a
small horn Its a very small horn
 I know This wasnt meant to be an epic horn
that I totally failed on This is intentionally a
small horn Glancing at the top you can see
Avantika has climbed to the center of the mainmast
and towards one of the crows nests up top and
looking down points to you Fjord and goes
Quartermaster call two of your compatriots that
you trust to the top with me
 You guys climb up the mainmast to the crows
nest and there you see Avantika with a spyglass
and she leans in to the three of you directing
mainly towards Fjord and goes Now that we are
at sea I want to show you something She pulls
out the spyglass and holds it over to you and
helps you point it in the direction Here you see
a vessel a little ways off on the horizon A
little bit north of where you are a northwestward
direction She whispers over your shoulder so the
rest of you can hear Glancing at this ship ahead
of us it appears to be a Concord ship A shipping
vessel probably carrying trade goods It appears
to be equipped for rapid travel but we could head
it off As my quartermaster I ask you for your
opinion What should we do
 Take a look What do you see
 Make a perception check
 Okay Glancing at it its a pretty well
made ship Its meant for speed It doesnt appear
to be heavily manned Its not carrying or
transporting people It doesnt seem to be a
transport ship of any means You see a handful of
small sailors on board with a hand crossbow or a
saber thats sheathed at the side You see on the
deck a handful of crates that were not kept
beneath which means its probably pretty
wellpacked It does appear to be Concord colors
Since its traveling southward you gather its
probably recently finished especially with your
experience as a sailor finished stocking up on
all its materials travel supplies and its goods
Based on the path its heading southward its
either going to arc around to TalDorei or be
heading in the direction of Marquet or possibly
if its feeling risky the Shattered Teeth
 Depends if we can do so quickly without
losing any sort of momentum perhaps Not all
ships are boarded and there is a loss of life
Most Id say probably  percent of encounters
out here is just intimidation Most let us take
what we want and continue on our way They dont
want to die
 Well to be fair there are plenty of
assholes on these waters so it does not surprise
me But it is your choice I say You may talk
amongst your friends but there is opportunity
 Not unless they how do you say they are
stupid
 Either or
 Make a perception check
 Okay You make out the same details as he
does Nothing catches your attention Nothing
about it seems out of the ordinary per se but it
does seem to be a vessel that is filled with its
payload and making its way south
 Make a perception check
 An aggressive trade Interesting
 What is your decision
 You watch as this playful look on her face
as she watches this discourse turns into this
extremely intense Jokerlike grin and she goes
Well then welcome to piracy my friends Come
She jumps off the side and heads the ropes down
and begins shouting off commands to people on the ship
 The sails shift as the ropes are being
pulled
 All right
 Bouldergut
 Yes Bouldergut is on this ship She has
been moved from The Mistake partially because
Bouldergut acts as a bodyguard to Avantika and
because the other ship itself is in serious need
of repairs They assume probably dont put the
giant heavy ogre on it
 Sure enough Bouldergut is down there
currently getting ready with a giant great club
that is carved from an older masthead
 What
 Right For show
 She looks back and Avantika goes Oh dont
worry You are the quartermaster You are the one
who is to be boarding any sort of ships that we
encounter so you choose your people
 At this point you watch as Ipess who is the
second mate of the ship this sunburned gnome
begins scurrying up the rope to go ahead and put
their flag on display Ipess IPESS
 The flag on this is a dull gray purple color
and it has a similar sketch of the same eye tattoo
that Avantika has on her chest
 As that goes up and the ship begins to move
to intercept glancing through the eyeglass in the
distance you can see the other ship noticing the
approach and there is now a bunch of chaos as they
all begin running up and down the ship notifying
everybody else on there What are you doing to
prepare guys
 The angry tough redbearded dwarf that
actually acts as the cannon master of the ship
that goes by the name of Ophiscan Duth Im
interested in possibly getting involved but this
is too much fun to watch Keep going goblin Im
liking it
 Two of the other deckhands who act as powder
monkeys are also helping get things organized
 Though I would recommend if youre going to
fire do a warning shot Tends to get them a bit
spooked in their boots and slowing down
 Across the bow not at the ship In front
of it away from it but just enough to show a
little bit of power
 Theres a bit of a range of error with
these weapons Theyre not a perfect art
 At this point the sails are fully unfurled
Speed is picking up The other ship was trying to
gain speed and it is a very fast ship but as it
tries to move away it ends up putting you at a
parallel pace At which point the master gunner
leans into you and goes Ahem About now would be
fine I think
 We want them to slow down eh
 He gets behind you and not quite like
making the vase in Ghost but is trying to help
show you exactly how to set things up and get the
cannon ready and aim it
 Powder place the shot put the fuse in aim
then fire
 Yeah Go ahead and make an intelligence
check
 Okay
 You light the fuse
 
 What order did you put them in
 I dont think thats how
 I think you fucked it up
 I think thats right were going to have
to clean that cannon
 Youre going to have to clean that
cannon
 All right well move over to this one So
you begin setting up the other cannon
 So you put the powder first put the ball
get the  The other cannon goes off
 Theres a shaking sound with splintering
wood and a bit of smoke in the vicinity You
glance over and that cannon is fucked
 At this point Ophiscan sees this and knowing
your skill set goes Go back upstairs Theres a
lot of powder in this room
 Upstairs
 Fireboy Go Go get
 All right so you owe us a cannon Try
again
 Well see if that would help a destroyed
cannon
 Thats a lot of material
 A single break or tear no That cannons
fucked
 All right try it again The DC is lower
this time because now youve fucked up
 Youve managed to head them off Theyre
managing to get speed and theyre curving this way
and you guys are curving to meet them
 Yeah
 Without issue this time proper order with a
rapid pace Halfway through Ophiscans like Eh sorry
 You set it light the fuse  The
whole thing lurches back about two feet and
theres a large wooden platform that catches it
from the impact The room shakes for a second and
you glance through the little side of the gunport
and you watch it hit the water maybe about  feet
out from the front of the other ship You hear
shouting from the other ship and you watch as it
starts to slow and come to a slower crawl It
begins to give up its chase
 This is more for just a visual perspective
 Well no this was sent to me by fans of the
show who actually make these and then this I had
custom made a while back in case this ever came
around
 Yeah lasered in Just to give you
perspective as you guys pull up from the side of
this eventually the two ships are brought in
anchor is dropped
 This is yours here This is the
Squalleater On the opposite end the crew has all
moved up to the deck They have weapons at the
ready but not necessarily ready to fire Theyre
in the process of realizing they dont have much
recourse at this moment The rest of Avantikas
crew or at least a number of them have come up
on the deck in support But youre the one whos
helming this What do you do
 The Squalleater Oh their ship
 Yes To give you kind of a brief perspective
here what you see on deck off to the side Those
are the people you see Some of them appear to be
deckhands and arent armed aside from a small
shortsword on their side A couple of them appear
to be a little better dressed but none of them
are warriors They dont appear to have a very
visible guard on the deck of the ship
 No go ahead
 Okay
 Soon as that sentence comes to an end you
hear a rapid clattering of heavy wood against
wood Its all of the various ports and doors in
the interior of the ship all manage to slam open
at once All the members on the opposite side look
at each other Make an intimidation check
 A  They all look at each other and begin
to back even further away from the edge One of
them rushes down and goes deeper into the ship and
a moment later returns with one figure which
appears to be better dressed than the others You
see very bright blonde hair and a relatively
welldressed leather tunic over decent captains
clothing He comes to the front and goes I am
the captain of The Stormcap Who am I to be
parlaying with
 I am Captain Jules Errog of The Stormcap
and I would very much like the lives of my men
spared What supplies do you need Perhaps there
can be a trade organized
 His expression gets really confused Its
like Okay
 Avantika is on the other ship just leaning
against the opposite side watching this happen
just keeping an eye on everything
 Looks across to the rest of his men looks
over towards you again
 Okay
 The intimidating Thaumaturgycasting Smeed
Okay Do as you will
 Bouldergut takes a step towards the
gangplank and goes Grrr Looks over at Avantika
who shouts Perhaps not having her on the plank
is a good idea
 Bouldergut backs up and does a running jump
and hits the other side and you watch the ship
shift in the water from the impact and the weight
of this ogre So now you have that
 A Fire Bolt
 Make an intimidation check
 Okay The captain thinks to himself and
nods He turns and steps aside from the doorway
that hes been standing in
 Okay At your disposal right there would
probably be Vera who is the previous
quartermaster but she is a bit older not quite
geriatric but is in her older years
 Vera Ipess or Norgul Vera Norgul is her
name Who are you calling
 A giant bushy bearded gnome comes by and he
has his shortsword drawn All right Lets do it
Lead on The three of you make it across the
gangplanks and now the group is four of you
including Bouldergut The large opening that leads
down into the ship the rest
 The captains quarters is underneath in the
back
 Okay As you head down almost everybody
whos on the ship is up top You see a few figures
that are deckhands cowering in rooms Theyre
scared shitless and when you begin walk past you
hear  Theyre trying to stay quiet
Youre in the captains quarters What are you doing
 Make an investigation check
 A number of shipping ledgers There are
books keeping tabs on payments to the crew and how
long theyve been hired There is one paper you do
find that is hidden in a locked compartment
beneath but you manage to find underneath this
little bit that you can slip your fingers through
and pull a sheet of paper out on the opposite end
of the shelf This is a list of the supplies on
the ship
 There is food and water for the journey
There are Clovis Concord spices Menagerie Coast
specialty dried meats tropical fruits that are
specifically frozen and brought so theyre slowly
thawing through the journey to get them as fresh
as they can where theyre going This looks like
this journey was intended to go to Marquet to
Port Damali The Bay of Gifts Amongst all the
various bits of general supplies cloths
clothing and silks that are specific to the
Menagerie Coast there are some elements of Empire
goods as well that are put in there But the thing
addition Everything else seems to be written in
one type of handwriting and there is a different
type of handwriting in the final entry and the
and the amount that was paid for that was 
gold That was received by the captain on this
ledger to keep on the down low
 In here You do not not within this
chamber
 Okay While youre looking are you waiting
for Beau or are you heading out
 Beau joins up with you guys
 Actually as high your investigation check
was and you continued investigation into the room
in search of any sort of thing you do not find
this package but you do find underneath under the
small tossed somewhat mildewed rugs that mark
the floor there is a section of floorboard that
pulls open and there is a small chest that is
locked When you pull and shake it a bit its
filled with quite a bit of coin
 Its pretty heavy
 As you are moving and shifting it it sounds
like its filled with a lot of coin
 Bouldergut grabs it with one hand and walks
over As Bouldergut makes her way onto the deck
you can see the captain notice it and sigh
loudly
 Men please to the bow of the ship They
all begin to shift and make their way that
direction As the captain begins to move goes
All I ask please is leave enough supplies for
us to make our journey
 Does not break eye contact with you and
gives you a serious dark glare
 It certainly keeps the other side nervous
 You go past into the cargo hold which is
below here On the level where the captains
quarters are and just below theres the rest of
the cabin quarters for the rest of the crew and
then below that is the cargo hold As you make
your way past the various hiding other members of
the deckhand crew down in the lower cargo hold
there are a series of crates and barrels that
contain all the supplies that were on the ledger
you would assume all the different trade materials
 Which ones
 Okay Theyre all trying to keep a
distance from you scurry down and begin lifting
things at which point a voice below goes Whats
going on and they go Shh They begin to move
things back up to the top
 Make an intimidation check
 Eyes wide the pupils gyrating in a very
quick shaking motion I dont his name He came
with one of the pieces of cargo He just stays
down there
  and continues to grab and pull the
crates up
 From across the other side
 Yes
 Bounds across the gangplank on the other
side What do you need She heads down to the
ship with you
 The whole boat
 Okay The chest does not emit a magical
presence In order to really check the other ship
you have to go across onto its bow and scan and
walk across it Its a foot
 Okay As you begin to make your way over
towards the bow concentrating on the spell a
tiny little magic source below you deep in the
ship catches your attention
 In the other ship yes
 While this is happening
 You guys head down into the cargo hold
 Make a perception check
 Okay looking inside it is lightless and
appears to be empty aside from the series of
crates and shipping containers that are in here
other than the ones that youve had moved up to
the top Between the three of them theyve done
two quick upanddowns Theyve brought a fair
amount of supplies so far and theyll continue if
you tell them to
 No because you spent your turn helping
her
 Technically its both of you looking
 Okay Looking through Frumpkins eyes make
a perception check
 Youre just keeping an eye Okay So youre
just keeping tabs on the situation
 They all look at each other
 The captain steps forward and goes For
what
 Make a persuasion check
 Go Lieb That way
 Lieb
 I know so close One of the deck hands
looks and he goes What me
 Onto The Squalleater
 He comes across the gangplank over next to
you
 Hes just like I what
 While youre prepping he just looks over at
the captain very mournfully and the captains like
 Make a dexterity check
 So over the next ten minutes or so youll
be able to provide a fine tattoo of that simple design
 You got it Hes biting his lip 
 Okay You move ahead into the hold about ten
feet or so Theres a small pathway thats built
between all the different elements of crates and
barrels making sure that you can get to the back
of the hold
 Theyre not a sponsor
 As you move around the corner in a flash
you hear  You see this quick arc of
steel as suddenly from around the corner a
fairly wellarmed man with sundarkened skin
short hair pulled into a tight topknot or a bun
of some kind holding a longsword twohanded
swings at you three strikes That is  to hit
 That is  to hit
 And ooh that is a  to hit
 Three hits there That is  points of
slashing damage  points of slashing damage
and oh  points of slashing damage
 Avantika listens and goes Ah I trust he
can take care of himself eh
 Now I need you to roll initiative you to
roll initiative and roll initiative for Yasha
and Ill do for Bouldergut
  to  Beau youre 
 Oh so Yashas up first
 Okay good to know Yasha is up first
Seeing this flashing of blades across Fjord Fjord
gets knocked back careening into some of the
nearby crates They shift from the impact you
hear the cracking of wood As soon as the figure
pulls back getting the blade into defensive
position backing up against a corner with that
was set with a table and a chair and this is
essentially the guarding post of this figure
below Theres a very faint bit of light in the
corner from a hooded lantern thats been faced
towards the inside of the crates so it wouldnt
give any sort of light that revealed his location
You see him going into a defensive position
Yashas up first Yasha
 Armored Yes halfplate
 Go for it
  misses The blade scrapes across his
armor no impact
 The first one scrapes across the armor
causing a couple sparks to fly and briefly
lighting up his position The second time he
actually pulls the longsword up and manages to
parry and cause the blade to completely miss
impacting and getting stuck about an inch into the
wood before she draws back angrily gritting her
teeth That ends Yashas turn Beau youre up
 All right
  hits
 All right roll initiative
 Stunning strike on him Thats a con save
That was out of the box there
 He has a pretty decent con but he only
rolled a 
 Whats the DC
  yeah he saves on that one
 Its eight plus your proficiency bonus plus
your wisdom
 Yeah so the first strike hits him across
the head but he manages to resist it He pulls
back  teeth gritted
  hits Roll damage for the second strike
 Six points of damage
 You dont know It seemed to be pretty
decent he rolled a  on that one But you can
try it again
 Another ki point That is a 
 First strike no impact he pulls back Hes
rearing to try and deflect or at least keep you
at bay The second strike as you crack right
across the side of the head he goes down onto one
knee You see him his eyes go wide as theyre
rolling a little bit in his skull and hes
currently trying to shake You rung his bell You
still have your bonus action
 With advantage if youre
 Five points of damage Hes stunned and on
his knee
 Okay that brings us to Boulderguts turn
 Bouldergut Theres not a lot of space
here so Im going to give her disadvantage on her
attack because she has to try and swing this large
greatclub in this enclosed space as an ogre
Charging by  comes down to do an
overhead strike Actually it would have advantage
because stunned so its just a regular roll Let
me try that again Yeah thats a natural  that
hits For that he takes  points of damage on
that hit The other attack  that hits
Another  points of damage Nice As hes on one
knee Bouldergut comes around and she slams He
almost falls to the ground again The giant impact
slamming into the back of the metal You can see
that actual armor dented inward from the impact
She pulls up for a second strike down on top This
one actually sends him down on the ground Hes
trying to get back up from that impact The back
of the armor is pushed in Its limited some of
his mobility within his shoulder blades from the
way the metals pushed towards his upper shoulder
Thats going to end Boulderguts turn Its now
Frumpkins go
  hits
 That ends Frumpkins go Fjord youre up
 Make an intimidation check Because hes
stunned and beat to shit Ill give you advantage on it
 Okay that ends your turn Yashas up
 Okay make an athletics check for her with
advantage because shes raging
 Okay he fails strength and dex saving
throws Doesnt say anything about abilities
Ill say yeah she grapples him thats fine
Beau youre up
 Hes currently being held by Yasha and
looking right over at Fjord whos backed away
hands up
 Thats your turn
 Okay It comes to his turn hes being held
by Yasha and he shakes off the daze Grits his
teeth and just throws his sword to the ground
 Four points renegade one point paragon
Yashas still clutching him there Yeah
 Hes still being grappled by Yasha without
saying a word Theres this look of defeat and
acceptance of ones pride Hes just trying
desperately not to engage more than he has to and
glances over towards a crate that is across from
where he was sitting that would still be in his
visual perspective But its an unsuspecting crate
pushed in a cluster of others He looks in that
direction and gives a head nudge
 Okay
 No
 Make an insight check
 Hard to read Hes a pretty grim fellow
What did you say
 Okay All right
 Whatever you want Please just let me
go
 You lift it up Looking inside theres a
few heavy sacks of rice or grain or sand You
cant really tell But theyre all lining it for
weight on the crate In the center theres a
pillow or a piece of folded fabric thats folded
in place in the center You pull the fabric back
and there you see a very intricate wooden box
Its about maybe that big Its about the size of
a shoebox if you will but its really
wellscrolled and carved wood Like a whittler or
a carver spent a lot of time to make it look very
beautiful and presentory
 It has these chain handles on the sides that
dangle on the edge It has a little latch on it
and its locked
 Yeah Its pretty light
 The captain on the stop says something like
Are we done yet
 I dont believe so
 
 Youve already guaranteed I lose my job and
my wage What more can you take from me
 I was
  gold upon my return
 You just slip it into his pouch
 He looks confused and untrusting like hes
caught offguard by it
 Soma
 He just glares at you
 Okay there you go Nott Beau catches up to
you on the other ship
 There are two of the other powder monkeys
that are currently playing cards
 Yeah
 Its pretty wellmade
 Is Prayer of Healing concentration
 When you came in Yeah The source of magic
was that box
 Yeah
 Soma
 Im a hired protector
 It is when people like you come in here and
ruin it
 Youd be surprised how much of an industry
revolves around just that
 Hes taken aback even more I will say you
are definitely the strangest pirates Ive ever
heard of
 He nods begrudgingly
 It was He looks over at the back part of
it thats been smashed to shit by the ogres greatclub
 There are a number of crates in the
vicinity
 Checking for traps you have to get close
and inspect it
 All right go for it Make an investigation
check
 It is trapped
 Its a fairly complex trap
 Mechanical
 You gather its probably whats inside the
box You could attempt to disarm
 Yeah thats what Mage Hand can do
 As Yashas still clutching him there hes
like
 Make a thieves tools check please with
your dexterity
 As the gentle Mage Hand clutching the
thieves tools begins to do this weird ghostly
finger dance across you see it go 
Ting You hear a spring break As the Mage Hand
shockers the box sure
 You hear the spring break on the interior
and it seems the trap has been disabled
 That was disabling the trap Now you have to
open it Roll to unlock it
 There are three locks Theres one lock in
the front and two on each side Rapidly they
come open
 Okay You go to open it up and the inside
its soft velvet interior of the case There you
see a small ceramic pot of some kind roughly
about that big that has a lid on it and it is
enclosed Then above it mashed in there a
paintbrush About a foot long
 A little pot of paint it looks like
 The guard glances over and goes This is
bullshit This is fucking bullshit
 Yes
 I dont want to talk about it
 Ive already given you too much Let me go
amongst my pride swallowing
 I dont know
 I do mercenary work out of Port Damali from
time to time and other places along the shore
Normally some of the higherpaying jobs are a
dontasktype scenario
 That is very true
 Hes just giving the thousandyard stare
into a shadowy corner
 All right Bouldergut stops and turns around
toward him and pats him on the head and then
follows up behind you guys
 Captain Jules Errog says No Would you
please leave us if you have everything you need
 
 He runs back across like 
  
 The captain gives a nod Thank you for
sparing the lives of my men
 As you guys come across the rest of
Avantikas crew pulls over the gangplanks They
pull up anchor Avantika looking over the
opposite side goes Do not pull up your anchor
until we are beyond your sight if we see you
shift beforehand we will turn right back around
The other crew nods Sails unfurl Wind picks up
Ship begins to move You begin continuing to head
westward Once youre a little bit out of earshot
and Avantikas keeping an eye off the edge of the
ship looks back to the rest of you and slow
clapping The rest of the crew begins to clap and
theres a bit of applause With that my friends
welcome truly to what it means to be free on the
sea Im proud of you So Lets see what you
found They go to start opening the chest and
well take a break there

  Well get that sent to you
right ricketysplit
 Having now made your way on the Squalleater
from as far as I know all of you your first
real bit of piracy Pulling away the chest that
was brought onboard is currently being picked and
opened by some members of the crew  As
it folds open looking inside you can see it is a
mass of gold silver copper and an occasional
glimmer of platinum coins This is quite a bit of
change At which point the captain looks over to
the quartermaster and goes Well done This will
be divvied up appropriately What else was found
Weve got some and then begin to point out the
food the thawing tropical fruit that was placed
there
 Boulderguts sitting there with the rest of
you looking around and listening to the captain
looking off into the distance Maybe ten feet from
you
 Make a deception check
 The captain glances past and goes Eh why
dont you stay here at least until were finished
divvying up all the findings
 Youre telling me All right anything
else What transpired below You have not told me
what happened Apparently there was some sort of
a scuffle and Bouldergut goes 
Yeah Tiny man in armor You begin to realize at
this point not a whole lot of timbre difference
between the male and female ogres that you have
encountered in your time Its generally just more
hair on the top of the head stubbles about the
same
 That is impressive Did you finish him
off
 Im impressed you are all very strongly
adhering to this notkilling aspect of piracy I
can tell you from experience it does not last
very long but I respect the intent Anything else
 She looks at you Hmm not bad Bouldergut
leans in right over your shoulder Beau and
goes Whats the
 Make a sleight of hand check
 As you reach back your coins slip from your
grasp and  all across
 Bouldergut goes  and starts helping
you pick them up but fumbling with her giant fingers
 Indeed
 Avantika gives a keen look towards Beau
nods
 Yes Jester
 I already have plenty but thank you I
appreciate the offer
 I will keep that under consideration
Anyway regardless well done Impressive work
Lets continue on to the Dragshallow Reefs Come
on
 You catch up to Nott Are you going as well
or is it just you two
 Thats what Im asking
 what are people
doing
 You as well It was very impressive
 You beat the shit out of that man
 I could tell that It was very nice well
done
 You too Goodbye
 Anyone else doing anything
 Okay you find Caleb Caleb if you havent
left the top of the deck
 All right you go to your chambers
 Yasha pulls in What is going on
 No
 No
 The full box Are you inspecting the full
box
 The box is about shoebox size
 Correct yeah
 No
 Cousin of the Metagaming Pigeon the Not
There Imp Not There Fairy there you go Dont
forget Nott you still have that marble silver
shield thing
 You can take time to do it a few times
 The shield yeah
 It does eventually use up the paint over
time
  I didnt think this through
 No in hindsight it occurs to me
 She would need a surface to paint it on
 You only had to actually be pirates and
fucking roll a ship to get it so live with that
 Goddamn it
 Yeah
 Technically
 No
 Okay
 I dont think you
 Technically anyone can use a shield but
youre not proficient you get a bunch of bad things
 Correct no shields
 All right
 Ill have to add it to there myself
 Its a custom item
 For any level its three
 Okay there you go
 Okay You take a little bit you do this
little dick and suddenly
 Okay and you paint it and finish it and
you look at it and take the edge of the
paintbrush and nudge it and it rolls a bit

 Its like a stone sculpture its not
fleshy its not made of flesh
 Yeah youre not turning this into Second
Life with all the different fucking floppy dicks
flying everywhere
 Youd have to find out and try
 No its  and then  on top of that
 Hmm Ill doublecheck that
 Ah there you go
 Make a perception check
 Okay It seems to be fairly clear
 No
 In the room youre in currently there is
not a port window
 You know the general vicinity of where it
would have happened It would take a little bit of
searching and a little bit of you know
 Yeah Depending on what you have at your
disposal like definitely narrow the search but
if its just based on your memory it would take a
while to find it but you know the general area
where it went down
 At this point its later afternoon
 Its like five or so youre like an hour or
two from dusk
 All right
 The rest of you go about your business
 Yasha does the same
 Okay
 How far away are you Jester
  feet
 Make a perception check
 Looking about across the deck you do not
see her currently near or visible
 A few more days travel to Darktow A couple
of moments here In one night that you are in your
room sketching your book testing out some of your
new paints you feel a hand on your shoulder You
glance over and you can see the pale soft fingers
and a dark greenish sleeve resting there You
glance over to the side and you can see the
draping hood and the slight curved smile across
the angular chin of the Traveler protruding from
beneath the cloak
 Hello I see you found a new toy
 Well Im quite excited at the things youre
capable of Jester How are things
 Surprise me
 Yes my dear
 Yes Ive been pleasantly surprised
 I know your tenacity is impressive
 Maintain that balance That seed of
chaos
 Well there are many different enchantments
that could achieve the goals you seek
 Trickery
 Listen Listen to what piques his interest
And then happen to be the source when he needs it
If that fails there are plenty of enchantments
that can sway his mind
 Ill do my best
 No
 I know So what are you making me
 Ill wait
 Im never far
  What are you making him
 As you finish painting it it takes gravity
It almost seems to fall a centimeter and center
itself It goes from a twodimensional shift its
almost like blinking
 Sitting up from the edge of the bed the
cloaked figure walks over and lifts it and
inspects it and places it back down
 Youre getting better
 Preferably where it would be the least
expected
 And the creepiest to find
 Im excited
 Yes
 Make me proud Jester
 The times coming soon well meet the rest
of your brethren
 Soon my dear
 As you look up from your notes closing your
book you turn to look and the Traveler is gone
 You guys dont know anything
 Fjord
 Maybe two days out from the reefs you go to
bed that night
 As sleep takes you you find yourself
kicking through the thick sludgelike waters that
surround you Sluggish in your movements the
darkness allencompassing yourself alone in these
shadowed depths A faint green light is visible in
the distance You push and swim towards it light
glowing brighter Closer As that grows closer a
second light even further impossibly distant but
you can acknowledge it rests on the horizon As
that first light gets brighter you can see this
source taking shape Its a figure Female Nude
also swimming Avantika emanating this strange
green glow Swimming ahead of you her body
wreathed in this faint greenishyellow aura She
looks and points to you The waters around you
seem to glow the same color light You look down
at your body and you see that you are now the
third glowing source of this green energy
Suddenly the waters are easy to traverse What
was once sluggish and difficult to Fjord is second
nature A voice comes through Watching The
distant light you see suddenly dives with
incredible speed Nearly out of sight Avantika
dives down after rocketing down below you
Breakneck in her speed you dart after her to give
chase moving far quicker than you anticipated
You realize the water is becoming thinner and
thinner like air Youre falling Three shooting
stars plummeting through a dark sky Learn
Glancing down below this endless void you plummet
towards you make out the details from a surface
rushing towards you You plummet towards an ocean
The faint distance endless glittering of moving
shifting waves of some sourceless moonlight just
barely giving the shapes below with three large
masses beneath you like a misshapen triangle of
land masses of incongruent sizes One two three
You rocket downward towards the space between the
three the center of this triangle Hitting the
waters of the ocean with tremendous force impact
but no pain You sink The light of the other two
figures glittering through the lightless waters
Down down you sink Until you see a
structure coming to view from below A tilted
tower wrapped in sea vines the hollow center
providing a wide tunnel further within You peer
inside this empty tunnel of the towers depths and
watch as a sudden bright yellow light shines from
two other lights seem to try and drift towards
you behind you you fall into darkness and the
dream ends
 You did you passed south of it Your piracy
stunt hit right at this trade route there
 Thats where you were The three masses were
not even in shape and size and they were clustered
 At the time from what you recall the ship
was heading outward
 Yeah Anyway Contemplate this
 In the next few days that pass eventually
the fog rolls in and the blue cloudy skies you
have become familiar with on this journey give way
to gray rainy and cold this marine front
rolling in as you begin to come upon the outskirts
of the Dragshallow Reefs
 Okay you do know that the current master
gunner is keeping a very close eye on you after
you have exhibited
 Okay make a sleight of hand check
 Okay You steal over time a pretty decent
amount of this powder Youre pretty damn proud of
it yeah Write down on your inventory you have a
handful of pepper

 Awesome go ahead and roll for that
 This would be tinker tools yeah
 With this one it would be yeah dex since
youve already made one
  Yeah you manage to construct a pepper
arrow
 Pepper bolt there you go
 The ship skirts around the southern edge of
the reefs You can now see the tangled graveyard
of destroyed ships and gathered driftwood marking
the shallow spots across this jagged cluster of
reef Curving around a southwestern passage a
channel that opens The channel beckons you entry
as you turn to head northward to what would be the
center the heart of this cluster No more than
maybe  minutes into entering this channel
Avantika shouts up at the rest of the crew Raise
the colors at which point the massive ogre
Bouldergut tosses the gnomish second mate Ipess
high up to the central mast to the crows nest
where he swaps out the flag to a new one one that
is straight purple As it begins to push its way
in make a perception check
 Make a perception check
 This is a different flag than the one that
was raised during piracy
 Natural what
 Okay
  so whats the total
 Nice
 Okay
 Okay Jester its a couple of things You
pick up on the detail of the flag It is straight
purple but there is something different about it
youre not entirely certain It looks like a
straight color but theres sometimes some of
the way the light hits it you can see a sheen in
parts of it Thats the best I can describe The
rest of you also look around and you can see
amongst these reefs not only are there the jagged
bits of it that come forward and bits of rock that
jut out the ocean amongst the rest of the rubble
around and it looks like a lot of it has been
placed both as a communal barricade on top of the
reef and as a challenge to anything that wishes
to come in but you can see in areas where the
rock itself is a little more sturdy and above the
surface there are watchtowers and there are
boltthrowers and catapults and there are
defenses all across elements of this reef that you
imagine are one of the many reasons its not been
taken back by the Clovis Concord in what you would
know to be the plus years that Darktow has
belonged to what is known as the Revelry
 The Revelry is the communal band of pirates
that work together to maintain some internal
order Make a history check Fjord and anybody
else proficient with history
 Okay
 Okay
 Fjord and Caleb you know that this began as
a dispute with the heads of the guilds in the
Clovis Concord They own and run a majority of the
trade routes that come in and out but a lot of
the smaller shipping businesses and various other
sideindustry leaders were being overtaxed
repeatedly in an attempt to close them out of the
business and essentially completely own all means
of shipping in the vicinity This pissed off a lot
of people and eventually in moments of combined
desperation and frustration they banded together
and where Darktow was previously a very important
repair and stopping station this far out from the
Menagerie Coast for longdistance shipping they
ransacked it and took it over They killed those
that defended themselves and any of those who did
not want to raise arms would be absorbed and be
allowed to become a member of what was now called
the Revelry As such they have since held this
location and continued to be the source of piracy
both for their own wealth and continuation of
wellbeing but also as a continuous source of
aggression and destruction of the otherwise very
prosperous trade that the Clovis Concord runs You
do know also that the Revelry is run by whats
called the Plank King
 The previous one was killed  years ago by
the current Plank King who challenged him The
Plank King is known as Wyatt Marinas and all you
have heard is he is a giant of a man As you move
deeper through this channel the day goes on
begins to get somewhat dark as you begin to see
the glittering lights of the southern edge of
Darktow Isle The cold pulls through and a light
rain begins to fall as you approach This island
unlike the jungle islands that youve come across
and a vast majority of the Swavain Islands here
off the Menagerie Coast is mostly rock and cliff
In fact from what you can see most of this
island from this perspective is jagged cliff face
and probably a few hundred feet up is where the
islands even surface even begins At the base
around this cliff face you can see a scattered web
of a shipyard just tangled docks that
maneuver around containing dozens and dozens of
ships Across that you see numerous torches that
mark various intersections where they all meet
and built into the base of this cliff face you
see a number of buildings and windows all slowly
being lit as the night grows darker and darker
This mass of naturallooking hivelike pirate
city there stands before you Welcome to Darktow
 As the ship makes its way to the docks and
eventually comes to a stop you can see a few
figures up there at the edge one of them that
rings a bell as it comes in and a couple that
come out to meet Avantika Steps out and theres
a couple of hands raised and go Hail
Avantika She goes We have returned I know it
has been quite a while but success and
celebration I believe are on our lips tonight
A few of the men come up and look over the crew
and look over a few of you and take some notes
and then dart off
 The ship now has docked theyre beginning
to take remains of the supplies the Mistake is
pulled off onto the other side and Orly and your
other hired crew are looking very wideeyed and
confused about what the fuck is going on You
literally hired a bunch of guys out of
 Nicodranas that have now been brought into
a
 Yep
 As you begin to step off the ship
 Jamedi steps off with the rest of you
 Looks to Avantika and goes up to her and
goes You still owe me  more gold I counted
what you gave me She goes Oh my apologies I
thought I had correctly counted that She pulls a
few coins out of her purse and hands it to him
Counts it himself Our business is concluded
Looks to the rest of you Be careful around this
one Be safe He turns and walks into the city
 It is salty with sea splash and cold to the
touch because of the nature of the stone
 No one talked to him over the journey
 There was a lot of back and forth over the
journey Avantika turns to the rest Crew It has
been a good journey You have all been very kind
You have been resolute and Ukotoa will be proud
 Tonight we drink Come Let us be off to
The Bloated Cup The rounds are on me
 Marius comes around the edge of the
 Of the docks Yes remember Marius
 Yes Hes like Okay dont mean to make
this really Where the fuck are we
 Okay
 
 Both really
 What should it be
 Got it
 Oh theres more
 LePual LePain
 Orlys big turtle hand clasps on the back of
your left shoulder Beau and goes Oh I kind of
like that one
 Well I like juice
 
 Wait what
 Im going to need a drink
 The rest of the crew looking confused
amongst themselves stick together and they come
over One of them his name wouldve been oh
Actually no at this point this is Gallan
Gallan who has recovered and is
 Yes Who has become loosely the because
hes the only one who was originally on the Mist
and knows it well hes become the den mother of
the other hired crew youve brought into this
wiley adventure He comes up and goes So All
these ones
 Whats the plan
 Ill ask around He doesnt seem bothered
by it Hes been here before Gallan left this
port on the Mist But he seems genuinely Over
the travel hes gotten a little bit concerned and
seems somewhat invested in the new crew youve
hired He goes and relays that message to
the rest of them
 In the meantime the rest of the crew seems
to have followed suit with Avantika leaving a few
crewmen that are just a part of the docks to keep
watch
 Pretty damn well patrolled and monitored
This is the bread and butter of their business
 You get the sense here and based on your
history checks everyone who resides in Darktow is
a member of the Revelry
 By the way you guys are members of The
Revelry
 Well by becoming part of Avantikas crew
coming into port and having a few individuals
mark your presence you imagine thats probably
the case
 Well what are you guys doing
 Its more the former than the latter from
the first part There is no uniformed guard
there is no
 Yeah the heavy realm of piracy has only
existed for plus years on this coast
 Its still in some ways finding its
footing
 Winding through the docks following the
rest of Avantikas crew the docks and bridges
its this labyrinth to find your way beyond that
to the stone and rock where you had kissed
earlier The city itself is a series of switchback
paths and carved caverns and cave entrances that
have since been outfitted with pieces of wood
with windows Now at this point its pretty much
pitch black in the sky What little bit of light
there is from the nearby torch and lantern light
gives just a hint of the mist thats rolled in
across the outskirts of the island The only light
sources you have are those you keep on you or the
distant glowing smattering of hundreds of firelit
windows lit from the inside the warm buildings
that make up the city As you make your way to
what you assume to be the tavern The Bloated Cup
if you will Avantikas currently standing outside
talking to somebody There you see this burly
roughlooking human man probably a week and a
half unshaven this thick five oclock shadow
Grayish curled hair that goes right about
shoulderlength Its slicked back probably with
his fingers to one side but its oily enough
where it stays in place Looks like hes wearing
an officious coat and theyre currently in the
middle of a discussion and she looks over her
shoulder to the rest of you and goes Ah my
apologies There is one bit of business we must
attend to before we can celebrate The rest of you
continue on My new compatriots it seems and
the human figure pipes up and goes Word has
reached the ears of the Plank King that youve
brought new blood here to Darktow I imagine these
are the new blood based on and he looks at a
sheet of paper thats handed to him and looks at
the description that was written and he would
appreciate you bringing them to The Throne Roost
and have an audience
 Well Im the assistant of the Plank
King
 James Tybalt
 Im certain he wouldnt argue He smiles
now This is the first time youve seen his grin
and theres maybe six or seven teeth Most of
them are blackening Id recommend yall follow me
 You too Avantika He wants to check in
She sighs but gives a smile Ipess bring like
 He starts counting out gold from one of the
chests they had brought with them
 No
 Thats what quartermasters do
 Its all good The coin is passed over to a
smaller chest and Avantika carries it up under her
arm You guys are led to the western side of this
city and then begin climbing up this precarious
set of winding stairs carved out of the rocky
cliff
 Above the city slick with mist and recent
rain It looks like the way the winds hitting
the rain isnt hitting the cliff side but you can
see it passing maybe   feet in front of you
 Partway up this climb the occasional torch
is now replaced with a wooden pike holding a skull
or a head at varying stages of decay
 Okay you put your metal scary mask on
 Youre led up further maybe   feet
up this cliff face Leading you with some of the
bursts of wind to lean against it to pull across
The stone stairs themselves vary from two feet
wide to maybe a foot at times Looking down over
the edge you can imagine a few folks have found
their end with an odd misstep The stairs finally
stop at a wide stone shelf that overlooks the town
at about  to  feet above the furthermost
edge ending just above the rocky waters of the
inlet A cave mouth greets you against the cliff
warm with firelight Two watchmen notice you and
they stand there keeping an eye as a cloaked man
pushes past you to descend from where you came He
just pushes past you Avantika nods to the guards
and shows the chest
 Hes a little ways past you now Make a
perception check
 Its too dark and theres too much rain
Its hard to make out any details unfortunately
Avantika continues in after showing the chest the
offering The rest of you follow
 As you follow inside the smell of fine
cooked meats and sauces mingles with wet leather
and stagnant water A soft fiddle and squeezebox
duet dances through the evening air the bardic
sources atop stools next to a large stone chair
carved from the surrounding rock Sitting atop the
throne is a giant of a man half giant to be
precise His dull gray skin marked with scars
his coat long and velvet blue tattered at the
edges Plain breeches and boots shift as he
stands his eyes cold shifting with his smile
Long black curls toppling along the sides of his
head past his shoulders framing his face to
about mid chest Now you know this through your
research and some of you had experiences for the
most part male goliaths dont have hair let alone
such luxurious locks
 As he stands up a servant enters and leaves
a bowl of somewhat bruised feet somewhat bruised
fruit at the feet of the throne The large figure
claps his hands once loudly and the music stops
coming to a halt Deep guests Avantika You
bring guests Welcome friends to the Revelry
Come sit a spell Two servants all of a sudden
come behind you hear the scraping of wood against
stone as two long benches are pressed behind you
You find yourself awkwardly having to sit on them
as they creak with your weight Another bowl of
nuts and somewhat mushy berries is placed in
Caduceus hands a bottle of wine is opened and
handed to Caleb My manners where are they
 I am Wyatt Marinas the Plank King of
Darktow master of the Revelry
 And you are
 Sets it awkwardly on one of the arms of the
stone throne Okay Gilligan So Avantika it
seems you took all of these under your wing She
nods and takes her chest and puts it forward and
goes That is true and I believe the rest will
introduce themselves here in another moment
 
 Yasha just goes Im Yasha Well youve
all come under the banner of the Squalleater What
draws you to a life of piracy What drives you
 All right
 Looks to Yasha I like to punch things
Kind of smiles Looks back over his shoulder
Youve got all that Linus And you see off to
the side in an alcove you werent looking you
see a man hunched over whos currently writing
everything down in a book and sketching and hes
paying really close attention to everybody and is
listening
 Yeah
 No

 Hes feverishly taking notes and sketching
You recognize hes drawing as well as making notes
 Okay Well if the captain here vouches for
you then I trust you wont go causing any
trouble Only law here is no trouble coming
between pirates while within the reef You cause
trouble on land I judge you Youve seen a few
judged on your way up here
 Trouble outside the reef well youll
either return to explain your cases and I decide
whats fair or in need of punishment or if you
dont return I just assume youre guilty Thems
the big ones you understand
 Depends on what the other one thinks If
the other one doesnt want to be harmed or stolen
from well thats breaking the law
 Well hard for me to hear that you broke
it Now Darktow means protection means family
And family shares its good fortune He looks to
Avantika and she now kicks the chest across and
scrapes He stops it with his foot and kicks open
the lid and the coins are there now visible a
couple spilling out I accept your tribute
Welcome back Well get your ships up and fixed
real soon Welcome to the Revelry 

 You all sorry lot youve certainly shacked
up with one of the craziest lasses of the Swavain
Islands thats for sure
 A damn dreamchaser she be So be warned
 She looks up at him and goes You are quite
the peach yourself there master Squints to
himself Well thanks thats it shove off Get
the fuck out of my room
 Yes
 Hes glaring over at you
 Of course
 No I have my drinks brought up here
 As Avantika leaves the rest of you are
leaving Takes his arms and pushes you out
leading you to the exit
 Make a perception check
  Couple of things you notice One
 you
glance in the vicinity you look and notice the
Plank King Right where the hairline is its a
duller paler white In that moment you remember
the first Plank King was definitely known for his
longer darker locks

 Looking around the interior of the chamber
because the way this is carved inside the
mountain its this nice arched cavern top and
there are number of alcoves and hidden spaces and
you glance around it and first at just a quick
glance notice at least six or seven other figures
that are hidden in the alcoves just watching
 Figures Seem to be either human or
 As youre all being ushered out of the
chamber and pushed to the side the Plank King is
like Anyway off with you Enjoy your night
drink well Well take care of that and theres
a little tug on your arm Beau The Plank King
comes and whispers in the side of your ear He
says Youve a keen ear right Avantika ever
does anything untoward to our little community
here you let me know Theres some grand coin in
it for you
 Just backs away
 Okay
 With that you make your way out back to
the stone steps Avantika sees you all exit and
goes Well that was harrowing and necessary but
over Now for drinking yes
 Hes certainly a series of adjectives yes
Ill give you that
 Well over a decade probably
 Oh well its not paying him to not kill
us its sharing in our spoils to better the community
 I dont know Ive never tried
 Nevertheless Im going to get drunk Whos
with me
 All right come on She smiles and turns
around and you all begin to make your trek down
the somewhat slick stone steps to the darkened
city of Darktow the glittering firelight the
open windows below leading you to whatever revelry
the evening has in store And thats where well
pick up next week
 You a stole a ship and followed the path
 It is a point of comparison this is true
 Well guys this is a very unique flavor of
campaign
 Hes a fun one On that note folks were
going to pick this up next Thursday Look forward
to the art book coming on sale Monday morning the
final chapters the second half and end of Vox
Machinas campaign as created and presented by
you the fantastic art community Yeah other than
that have a wonderful weekend we love you and
is it Thursday yet Goodnight guys

 And welcome back Wow You guys are ever
creative Last we left off The Mighty Nein
Garbage wine
 The Mighty Nein had made their way to the
Menagerie Coast got swept up in a bunch of chaos
and found themselves out at sea amongst the
Swavain Islands taken in by a pirate crew
captained by Captain Avantika basically at threat
of death otherwise Sent to an island to
investigate a temple learn about seals that
possibly are keeping your patron Ukotoa at bay
Made your way back across the Lucidian Ocean
towards the city of Darktow Actually actively
partook in some piracy
 Polite piracy Sure
 Whatever it takes to help you sleep at
night And found yourselves at the pirate city of
Darktow surrounded by the Dragshallow Reef Where
you had just arrived with both ships the
Squalleater and The Mistake The crew you had
hired out of Nicodranas looking very confused and
concerned at their current fate given the fact
they were just hired hands at sea You were
ushered up along the sheer cliffs alongside
Darktow Isle a long stone shelf within the cavern
where the Plank King himself greeted you bid you
entry to the Revelry this extending band of
pirates across this part of the ocean Laid some
ground rules and sent you on your way And that is
where we left off Mighty Nein as you descend the
raincovered stone steps that descend down the
side of the cliffs hows that for alliteration
in a phrase Making your way towards the
nowdarkened evening city of Darktow the distant
glimmers of interior firelight slightly emanating
from open windows You can see folks walking
through town the light drizzle threatening to
stifle the low torchlight being carried from
location to location You can see the outline of
dozens of ships that are locked into the shipyard
that surrounds the city as well as the crooked
outline of nearby barricades set up across the
reefs that surround the island Avantika proceeds
before you What would you like to do
 No just Avantika Her crew went to The
Bloated Cup which is a tavern
 Correct You assume youre headed back
there
 Correct
 Yes
 Possibly a weird answer
 Well when we return into the bay we are
to essentially give the materials or at least a
number of what weve managed to acquire We are
supposed to essentially what is the word Im
looking for What is the word Im looking for
 Tithe I would say Youre going through
customs and you have to
 Declare thank you You must declare the
amount of which you have recently come upon and
from that there is a tithe offer to the Plank
King roughly about  But we do not pay for
our ship repairs we have free asylum here within
the island and we are under the strict law that
if anyone doublecrosses anyone else within the
bounds of the city they will have the hammer of
the Plank King down upon them
 That is the way of life
 More or less yes Theyre not much into
governing more just
 A union with a very hardheaded and
forthright union leader
 Nah I have my own specific interests
theyre much more narrow
 Why do you have aspirations
 I didnt think so
 Well some of us do There has to be more
to you than just this
contradictoryforthesakeofbeingcontradictory
aspect eh
 Come lets have a drink huh First
rounds on me
 Well she lost a stone technically
 As far as I have been told at the very
least this was before my time joining the
Revelry there was a disagreement and the
previous Plank King seemed to be in the minority
of the side of this disagreement and the current
Plank King was in the majority So they stormed
the caverns of the previous Plank King and tossed
most of his corpse to the rocks below
 To his credit the current Plank King has
done a very fine job of maintaining organization
in the Revelry
 He doesnt bother me he leaves us well
enough alone we follow the rules we maintain
all of the benefits of being under the banner and
Im left to my own devices
 There are a number of unsavory types but
Ive made a bit of a reputation of being a
little eh People dont like to tangle with that
too much eh
 Lets see Open on the seas About  
years
 I got sick of following somebody elses
orders
 Ill tell you over drinks This is not the
best place to have these discussions eh Perhaps
after a few rounds Come To The Bloated Cup
 As you guys finish descending the stairs
into the city itself you catch there are quite a
few patrols through the city You can see the
torchlight being held by each as they make their
way just keeping an eye out You get the sense
that theres probably quite a number of
volunteers or at least individuals that are
intent on maintaining the semblance of civility
here within Darktow itself Leading close towards
The Bloated Cup its not that far from where you
had set your ship within the shipyard Its a
fairly large twostory tavern very wide across
its bottom and seems to be at least one of maybe
two social gathering sites here within the city
once the sun goes down Three blocks away you can
already hear the music chatter laughter and
yelling As you approach closer begin to look
from the outside in the warm light and the
movement of shadows across the open windows shows
you that the place is pretty jampacked As you
begin to make your way into following Avantika
to the interior you hear the shouting and
burbling and clinking of glasses as the far corner
has five or six individuals Youre not sure if
theyre paid musicians or just sailors who happen
to have a bit of experience with a fiddle a drum
and a flute of some kind As the music begins to
play you can see there is one table that has a
lot of Avantikas crew Theyve pushed a bunch of
chairs clammed together clammed crammed
together with some bits of dried bread and
somewhat soft fruit some cheeses laid out and
two large pitchers of ale already waiting at the
getgo Right off from them you see a smaller
table with everyone youve hired from The Mistake
including Orly all sitting there clutching their
glasses looking around scared shitless As soon as
you enter their eyes turn to you and they go

 At which point Avantika goes Come Have a
seat and pushes one of the other tables out of
the way of a few other people that are already
sitting at it She takes her hand and scoots it
across the table and they both go annoyed
grunt and spit on the ground and get up and move
away Immediately you get the sense that there is
a power dynamic Avantika seems to have at least
some modicum of respect amongst the rest of the
riffraff within this tavern
 Pushing the tables together kicking a
couple of the stools over it looks like theres
enough spots at the table for most of you One or
two of you might have to stand or find a place
next to the rest of your hired help
 As you guys all sit down drinks and rounds
begin to be passed to each of you conversations
already middiscussing You hear bits and pieces
about how the blessing of the Serpent has been
upon us this past month Being on the ship with
most of the crew they havent been terribly
social with you Theyve helped you and guided you
in learning a few things but theres still very
much this separation and attention that youre the
newcomers and a strange new shiny thing in their
captains eye This is the first time youve seen
them a little bit three sheets to the wind as a
group and theyre talking openly Avantika has a
definite zealotry to her but you start noticing
members of the crew and why they are with her or
at least now that theyve been there theyve
also bought into these tales of Ukotoa You get
the sense that they believe that this path that
shes following will lead to her success and by
default probably their success
 Make an insight check for me
 Okay thatll do Thatll yeah Okay You
get the sense that Vera whos the older human
the toughlooking woman who was her quartermaster
before it was passed to Fjord is definitely the
most invested in this idea this spiritual journey
theyre all embarking on with captain at the helm
You also feel that Ipess whos the gnome second
mate that youve encountered previously in a very
similar way is completely invested eyes wide His
general banter tends to be a little crazed and
sporadic but whenever theyre talking about the
Great Serpent now with phrasing of The Leviathan
as the title has become more prominent with
discovery theres a reverence to his eyes and an
attentiveness that is out of character for him So
you mark Vera and Ipess as two very intent
believers behind Avantika
 You get the sense that Bouldergut the ogre
halfunderstands it and is more just excited
because everyone else is excited Its like a dog
that gets really wound up when everyone around is
talking loud Thats Bouldergut A number of the
deckhands appear to be invested but theyre less
intensely driven and more just excited that their
captains excited and maybe starting to consider
that there is something to this now that theyve
seen the things theyve seen and the powers that
shes acquired Thats a good spread of what
youve managed to gather
 Okay Vera is sitting directly to the right
of Avantika and theres not much space to sit
next to her but you could grab a stool and
squeeze in to her right side
 There is no hard feelings I understand the
reasoning and the captains word is law I am
excited to see the great things you accomplish as
the quartermaster of our ship
 Precisely and for the captain
 I can only agree
 Aye aye Captain Looks to Avantika
Avantika right now is deep in the cups At this
point a figure turns around the corner You see a
spiked hair Its thinning on the top but you can
see hes taken thick balms of some kind to try and
make it look intensely young and failing halfway
Big mutton chops that come down to a very pointed
chin and hes dressed in fairly decent clothing
a nice silk vest with billowing sleeves out of his
shirt with some bangles that clink around his
wrists He comes and finds you on the opposite
side and looks across to Avantika grinning He
goes Well well well its been a while since
weve seen you round here She turns to him and
goes Ah Sorris Youre back from that fools
errand I see How was the Shattered Teeth He
goes Eh foggy and cold as shit How goes your
cloudchasing journeys love She goes Grand
We might have scored a fine shipwreck and a
promise of salvage eh Looks back to him You
up for hire perhaps He goes Eh tempting but
nah Im still fresh off the water want to enjoy
myself a while Shes like All right very
well well be in port for a day or two while we
get some repairs done If you change your mind
well just start shouting Im sure well find
your annoying voice easy enough He goes
 Sure that is eh Youre all new round
here
 At the moment no At the moment Im a
civilian and a drunkard
 No its a series of islands to the south
of here
 Sorris Sorris Kay Whats your name
 Fjord All right
 Me No Im a sniper
 Things Why are you so curious
 Speak for yourself sir Whats your
name
 Make a deception check
 He goes Okay Phillip and whats your
specialty What do you bring to the crew
 Thats actually pretty good
 Thats pretty good Me Ive got a few odds
and things mainly with a longbow Good shot
there but an eye that can see things on the
horizon mainly live up in the crows nest you
know Keep an eye out
 Hes joking right Avantika goes Im
afraid not His bailiwick apparently is being
curious and clueless
 Of course bar fights are fun Thats part
of the reason we live here
 If its a member of the Revelry thieving
from another member of the Revelry and it gets
found out its brought to Plank King Plank King
makes a judgment based on that some sort of
reparations or 
 More or less
 Why You looking for a fight
 Always
 I never throw the first punch so anytime
He taps the side of one of his jowls You hear the
ruffle of his fingers through his somewhat curled
muttonchop on the side
 Grabs a drink and without breaking eye
contact
 Roll an attack
  hits You do one point of damage plus
your strength modifier
 Boom right across his chin He falls to the
ground turns around rubs his chin That was a
surprising bit of power there for someone your
size Come at me He dives at you Roll initiative
 Oh he beats you at a   plus two For a
small size he is quick and he jukes to one side
turns around and goes for a haymaker to the side
of your face Thats cocked Thats a  to hit
 Ping Ah
 Go for it Make another attack roll
 Are you just doing damage or are you trying
to shove him and knock him prone
 Okay thats your athletics check
actually
 Hes going to make his acrobatics to try and
dodge
 Natural  He manages to leap in the air
and your tail hits the side of the table and
 to one side The drinks begin to spill
and one reaches out and grabs them prevents them
from being knocked over
 As soon as you turn back and say that you
look and hes not anywhere to be seen Then you
hear this  under the table You glance
down as you watch him leaping up from between your
legs and the table to uppercut you right in the
chin Thats  to hit
 He just manages to hit you You take three
points of damage Crack Right from underneath the
chin you feel your jaw clink into your teeth
theres a horrible screeching sound It hurts You
can feel the numbness in your face from the
impact After he hits you he darts off around
from behind and hes probably going to go in for a
hold but you have your go
 Go for it
 You go to swing for his head and he grabs
your hand and goes Ahahah He goes to pull
you forward to go for a headbutt
 Thats a  to hit
 Crack Right in the front of the forehead
and the nose you can immediately feel the blood
beginning to pour from underneath
 Behind you guys watch the crowd A lot of
peoples attention have turned to this bar fight
A few of them are now backing up and getting their
drinks ready to watch Somebody else at the table
goes  and punches somebody else and
starts another aspect and now theres another bar
fight beginning down the side corner Its your
go Oh wait Yeah because he finished the
heatbutt so you go
 Three points of damage Every time you get
hit he does three points
 Okay go for it Roll for an attack
 Yeah that definitely hits
 Another four points there All right Ugh
His eyes squint and roll backwards a bit and he
goes down into a crouching position 
Rights himself in almost a Muay Thai stance
 Yeah thats  He tries to swing and you
parry it off to the side without an issue Go
ahead and retort
 Go for it
  hits
 Because youre grappling
 Roll again for your athletics
 He rolled a natural one Literally a natural
one He tries to squeeze out but youve got a
firm grip on his wrist and you pull him back in
Youre now holding him to you hes grabbed
 No never Its his turn Hes going to go
try to slam his head backwards into your face
Ooh natural  thats a  Take another three
points of damage Crack It hits you For a
second youre afraid it knocked a tooth out but
you feel with your tongue and its still there
 Yeah hes still grappled
 Ooh nice roll for an attack
  hits takes another four damage Crack
It scrapes across his temple and it almost gouges
an eye and he turns and hes like Ah Youre
rambunctious arent you Hes going to attempt
to throw you off over his shoulder pull you into
a roll You get to make an athletics or acrobatics
check against him as he tries to break from your
grapple
 Breaks free and slams you onto your back
Youre now prone from the reversal but its your
round so you can get up or attack if you want
to
 Sure yeah
 Shes drinking and watching One leg up on
the table and shes glancing over watching this
transpire Youre going to sweep as you get up
 Roll for attack
  does not hit
 You sweep and he leaps up and then from the
air tries to come down onto your leg with the
full force of his tiny gnomish body Natural 
 Well say for the purposes of this because
the nature of the  well make it double full
damage because its fist fights thats six
damage to you from that Crack The leg and the
knee doesnt dislocate or pop out but you can
feel it get pushed to the limit and it hurts like
a mother Leaps up and like Not too bad Come
on bring it One eyes a little bit not
swollen but its starting to squint from pain
Bloods leaking out of his nose and his mouth and
its smeared on one side of his cheek and hes

 I like you too
  hits Thats another four damage on him
Crack crack This next series of hits come at him
and hes like Ha Yeah its nothing I can take
it Bring it Hes going to come forward and try
do a series of pummeling in your direction
Natural one The sheer impact of the last blow
seems to have knocked his block off and he starts
doing this series of pummeling in the wrong
direction instead pushing toward Caduceus He
moves out of the way He batters at the side of
his sleeve there and Ha Hows that Did I get
her Wait Looks around and finds you Hi Your turn
 One and a half
 He goes Huh Thank you
 Make a persuasion check
 He looks at you for a second Yeah Good
point I couldve taken you anyway
 Well pick this up another day
 He comes up and goes for a handshake grabs
your hand pulls you and gives you a soft
headbutt Its a little sore on both of you and
both of you wince Pleasure to meet you Whats
your name
 Okay Sorris Pleasure to meet you as
well As you guys are having this conversation
you hear behind you  Another
table behind is broken and you can see a person
unconscious across the shattered pieces of wood
arms curled in trex style
 The crowd goes  Everyone who was
mildly disappointed at the lack of finale to your
fight has now focused on the other one that has
completed with the smashing of furniture the
person on there left scrapped up and wrecked The
other individual one eye swollen shut
squarejawed burlylooking guy going Yeah
Everyone cheers
 Theyre just watching The scrap was only
between two or three people and one of them just
went down The other one called it off after that
and the declared winner everyones briefly
focusing on Then as fast as everyone cared
everyone sat back down and theyre back to
drinking You get the sense in that moment this is
not a rare occurrence around here
 It is a very curious question I imagine
there are probably some books That wouldnt be
what is commonly considered contraband or heavy
resale value Most of the time when you are
boarding a ship you leave the books behind If
youre looking for books your best bet is to go
to the Sundry Square during the day
 Its about four blocks to the left after
you leave the outside of here just outside of the
shipyard Its where all the awnings and ships
are
 You can certainly ask around Maybe both I
dont know
 That is possibly a few around if I
recall
 Well and she sits looks around everyone
at the table and gestures for everyone to lean in
a bit It looks like we are to after a couple of
days of travel and supplygathering make our way
northward to a location that has been brought to
my attention by our quartermaster There is a
likely chance that if there is some sort of
treasure there it would be of importance to our
mission However it is a salvage mission meaning
there will be some diving So I am looking for a
few things to prepare for that so a few of us can
comfortably make our way beneath the waves
 Beneath the water my friend
 That is up to you You are welcome to stay
behind However if things go correctly I dont
think there will be any worry of drowning
 Trust me I have a few connections that owe
me a favor or two here on the island Anyway I
need a day to acquire what is necessary
Nevertheless At this point she looks up at
somebody past you and goes Were having a
private discussion You turn and follow her eye
line and you see a human female with curled blonde
hair The curls have fallen in the moisture and
the rain from the outside dressed in a thick
ragged black coat holding a cup and she goes
Aye dont worry about me Just didnt expect
this shore to drag you in quite so soon Theres
a moment of tension
 No you have not seen this figure before
They both stare for a second and she turns and
walks off to a far table
 Yeah
 Dont mind her Its Allison shes
whats the word A right cunt
 Oh best of friends No just a very nosy
cothief at sea Doesnt know where to stop poking
where it doesnt belong
 No former competitor Anyway
 No weve crossed territories once or
twice and she has a habit of trying to embellish
truths to the Plank King Anyway Hand me the
map if you dont mind Oh maps here actually
 Avantika lays a map out on the table
 A cube will do
 As Avantika points it out she shows the
crew and says In two days travel we will make
our way outside of the Dragshallow Reef coasting
in northward for protection to about here We
begin looking for our salvage At which point
Orly whos glancing over the side rubs his chin
and goes Hmm I dont mean to question the
captains mmmain objective however that looks
like its right around where the Divers Grave
mmmay be
 She looks back and goes Perhaps but does
it spook you Do ghost stories make you shiver
turtle boy Orly glances back at her with a
narrowed stare and goes As long as Im staying
on the ship I dont mmmind He goes and sits
back down at the table
 At this point Sorris goes Oh is that
where youre going Youre going over to the
Divers Grave
 Well thats certainly an offlimits
location for most salvaging thanks to the cursed
woman eh Do you know much about your history
 Close but not at all
 Make a history check You can with
disadvantage because of your lack of experience
with the naval history
 You can make a history check as well
 Okay
 Doesnt quite catch your attention Youve
heard mention of the Divers Grave as it was a
series of poems from a book you once read The
thing that comes to mind is the name Dashilla You
instinctively mouth it Dashilla and he goes
Ah Dashilla the Dreadful You know about this one eh
 Ah Poem Ive not known but maybe the
song youve heard Some of the crew around nod
remembering and he goes and grabs his cup and
claps it twice to the table and the crew begins
to filter in as the song progresses and he
goes
 So he finishes the song

 Sorris goes  Where once the
waters rolled calmly by where oceans heart did
sing there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and
claws that grasp and wring With lantern lure of a
glimmer pot with treasure in her eyes below they
swam to the gold they thought would await them as
their prize Everyone starts clamoring together
with the third verse  Yet each of them
went to surely die their graves to not be found
For Dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost
and drowned Theres a moment where they all
begin to clamor the drinks together and clink them
and begin to drink them

 He looks confused So you dont know the
poem or the song
 Do you want a reprisal
  Where once the
waters rolled calmly by where oceans heart did
sing There stalked a lass with a hungry eye and
claws that grasp and wring With lantern lure of a
glimmer pot with treasure in their eyes Below
they swam to the gold they thought would await
them as their prize Yet each of them went to
surely die their graves to not be found For
Dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost and
drowned
 He goes But thats just an old wives
tale you know A myth
 Well I sail over it we just dont really
salvage that
 What In the middle of the ocean Why
Thatd be daft Good luck Looks at Avantika
 Good luck With the missus and turns
around
 You surmise thats who hes referring to
Avantika goes Dont pay him any mind It is a
myth and if its not well we just finished
tangling with a hydra and an entire island of snake
people Youre not seriously worried about a
woman eh
 I should have an answer to at least most of
our troubles by the morrow Just be patient
 Not any more than you would
 That is the idea
 No its best I do it alone Its more of a
older business relationship I dont want to make
him think that this is a how do you say
untrustworthy trade if you will
 Well oversee the repairs to The Mistake I
believe theyve begun before the night is over for
a bit We probably will not need it for this
endeavor so it will begin and when we return from
Darktow it should be complete
 Not in particular Theyll be looking
around here theyll be preparing Gather their
materials anything you think you require for the
trip at sea go ahead and gather it go amongst the
Sundry Square purchase what is required and then
hopefully within the next  hours well be back
out on the waves
 Drinking in the back having a conversation
with somebody and keeping one eye over at the
table Seems just perturbed Not directly intent
but occasionally narrowing her eyes in the
direction of Avantika
 It is good if you are going to do a night
walk alone or together as a group is much better
than alone
 Well the laws say youre not to steal from
another pirate in here but only if theyre caught
 But there are others out there perhaps who
see fresh faces and think well easy prey Best
not to cause a huge commotion immediately after
arriving Nobody does that right
 One would think yes Anyway I am a bit
tipsy and Im going to find myself an evenings
rest The rest of the night and tomorrow is yours
Good eve
 As she gets up some of the rest of the crew
stands up you see Bouldergut in the back stand up
as soon as the captain stands up and goes like
We going Come on this way Walks by puts
her hand on your shoulder and into your ear
Fjord as she whispers she goes Im staying
upstairs second room on the left and leaves
 Make a perception check
 Actually Caduceus just from his passive
perception has seen this What did you roll
  You see theres a momentary pause as she
walks by and the hand on the shoulder that
catches your attention You can see the lips
move and make out the essence of the conversation
The rest of her crew slowly gets up and some of
them stay to drink some of them go out to find
their way in the night
 You do recall walking through the city a
number of individuals stopping at the edge of the
docks and pissing into the ocean
 I mean
 Its entirely crafted of alleys No I mean
its not very jampacked around this particular
taverninn but there are some nearby buildings
where there are alleys This place is surrounded
by streets because its right there on the front
near the shipyard
 Okay and what do you do
 Okay As you take her hand she pulls back
You get a closer look at her theres this heavy
scar over one eye that keeps the eye mostly
closed You can see there looks to be a ruined eye
beneath there thats healed over and is not
functional She wears it proudly as a point of
intimidation or at least a badge of whatever gave
her that scar As she pulls back a little bit her
other hand going towards the dagger on the side
thats now revealed from behind her coat You palm
her the note and she looks and takes it
 She crumples it with a terse look and lets
it fall to the ground
 You guys walk out into the cold night air
The heavy mist has fallen across Darktow and you
can barely see beyond the outskirts of the city
where the ocean begins You can still hear the
waters coming in against the rocks on the outside
of the island but you cannot actually see where
the water connects Beyond that you can see the
outline of the ship masts that are set at the end
of the shipyard that are vanishing into the mist
that surround you What do you do
 Okay You find what would be considered an
alley behind the Inn and Tavern
 Here we have the direct connection from
live with both characters innarrative
Congratulations
 What are the rest of you doing Caduceus
you went out for some fresh air
 Jester
 Make a perception check
 Okay The crowd is pretty vibrant around
here A quick glance around you you dont see
anybody specifically paying attention or
interested
 Glancing now looking through the back
there is this staircase that winds up to a
secondary floor and it looks like there probably
is lodging
 Avantika left for the moment
 What are you guys doing
 Caleb
 Outside at the moment No
 For the record you guys do wait for about
an hour and a half two hours no sign of Allison
 Right Im just letting them know Thats
how long they would wait before they know that she
that shes not coming
 You all make your way gathering once more
in The Bloated Cup

 Right back around Oh man
 All right so what do you guys do
 Orly seems to be playing the mother hen with
Marius playing assistant to that
 I would be lying if it wasnt deeply
inconvenient
 If were staying behind Id say give me
about a hundred gold to watch over the nest around
here When you return well hopefully I
understand perhaps you mmmight be coming back
for us
 Then Ill return whatever was not spent
 Marius comes over and goes Right now
hoping no tragedy just come back and get us off
this fucking hellhole
 If you dont come back I dont know
 Travel from here to there and back about
four or five days round
 All right Well I wish you all mmmuch
luck
 I am hoping that is never the case Guess
Ill just make some coin in the interim
 I mean standard deepocean folk
 Sharks
 Other underwater beasts
 Perhaps mmmermaids and other such
dangers
 Probably some worthwhile loot there amongst
the sediment
 Oh a few hundred years maybe
 No ships go down all over the coast
 There are quite a number of creepy stories
on every part of this here coast
 Cant say I do
 Mmmy apologies
 Come back
 Yasha leans in and goes If there is any
trouble should I
 I trust you just
 Tell me when you want
 Sure
 Okay You guys leave the tavern
 Okay As you exit Caduceus you notice
this but Jester as everyones leaving you to
the back of it you feel a hand grab your arm for
a minute You look over to the side and you may
not have noticed earlier but Vera had been in the
inn in the tavern vicinity She pulls you back
from the rest of the group for a second and looks
you in the eye with this intense stare You can
see the wrinkles on the sides of her face pushing
into this tight crows nest on each side her
irises bloodshot She goes He would not be the
first shes left in ruin and he would not be the
last I will take care of him if he cannot She
releases you and spins around and walks off to her room
 You saw them discuss but you werent At
the point of talking and looking you wouldnt
have made out the words necessarily
 You guys are here in the open night air
Youre pushing midnight here at Darktow
 Its pretty misty There are not heavy
clouds in the sky and the moon seems to be not a
full moon but it seems to be fairly bright but
because of the mist it diffuses There is this
general faint moonlight throughout the entire
vicinity of the town What that does is it makes
distant visibility a little harder much like fog
lights at a distance There are a number of
patrolling individuals no uniform to them but
they walk around torch in hand looking through
the streets keeping an eye Theyre armed
armored but haphazard and no uniform
 Everyone here seems to be a part of the
Revelry including yourselves now
 Okay Both you and Beau make perception
checks please since youre both keeping eyes out
 Okay Youre keeping a gauge on any of the
wandering patrolling guards to make sure as to
not to speak too loudly or in the presence of
anyone conversation either shifting temporarily
or coming to a lull and walking by in silence but
you manage to snake your way through a relatively
quiet town beyond the various taverns this late at
night
 You do wander through what you assume to be
the Sundry Square eventually through this
wandering There is a makeshift pavilion where
its dotted with tables and crates under ratty
awnings and canopies but its all closed and
dark Theres no lights It looks like none of the
materials for sale are left behind Its mainly
just a structure and materials are probably
brought there in the morning and are placed out
for trade sell or whatever
 Make a history check
 You do know Darktow before it was taken by
pirates about  years or so beforehand it was
just another city of the Clovis Concord It
belonged to the Menagerie Coast and it was one of
the central port stops for a lot of the trade
routes making their way to the coast Then it was
taken by the Revelry and they reinforced it and
made it defensible They didnt slaughter everyone
there because they werent there to kill
everyone They were there to take it over They
killed those who were in their opinion
incorrectly placed in charge any dissenters and
then anybody who agreed to join the Revelry Join
or Die type circumstance everyone who had
previously been at the island were absorbed into
the Revelry Some of them have continued their
life there some of them their bloodline has
continued to be those that maintain other forms of
business Not everyone is technically a pirate
there are a lot of members of the Revelry that are
just civilians of Darktow and maintain the
island
  Sure

 Yes
 Hear that Taliesin has plans for you
Orlando
 No
 No it had two glass doorways like windows
but they open like doors and latch shut
 Roll initiative
 Ipess Ipess is a gnome yeah
 I mean there are quarters on there you can
stay in yes
 Youre not sure Some of them you saw found
rooms up top above the tavern you were in Others
left for the night you dont know where they
went
 Not really not here
 No you get the sense that Darktow doesnt
have a lot of offerings for travelers since most
of the travelers that come through here are part
of the Revelry Only a few of them stay offshore
You passed a number of homes of people that live
here or spend a lot of time here and have in a boat
 From the boat The Bloated Cup is right off
from where all the docks join and from the
shipyard so its maybe about  feet away
 All right
 You see this really uncomfortably frazzled
owl thats been jammed in a pocket
 As you begin to settle towards your
directions for the evening here under the shadow
of moonlit mist within the pirate city of
Darktow were going to go ahead and take a break
Well be back here in a little bit to see how
this
 Im excited to see what the fuck is going to
happen next Before we leave we do have our
Wyrmwood giveaway Our fantastic friends at

EmperorGeiserick congratulations Well get your

hope you enjoy Bringing us into the moment as you
guys scatter to your various plans
 We have Fjord going to the upper floor of
the Bloated Cup What are the rest of you doing at
this moment
 Okay Yasha is doing what as part of this
 Probably with you Shes a bit conspicuous
If things go really bad shell be ready to help
out on that side of things
 There you go
 Make a perception check
  Okay Looking out along the docks there
are two particular watchouts that are assigned to
that particular part of the docks where the
Squalleater is currently wet anchored You also
see two individuals on the deck of the ship not
holding torches but you can see them through the
fog One of them walks and moves Thats what you
see
 The docks are pretty open here There isnt
much of a place to hide This isnt a major
shipping region Most everything is taken off the
docks and off the ships and then brought into
shore so there isnt a bunch of errant piles of
boxes and barrels per se The docks are pretty
open Best bet would be somehow under the docks
but most of that is in the ocean or trying your
best to wait for a moment when people arent
paying attention
 All right As you guys are having this
conversation Beauregard manages to circle back
and come back to you
 Oh youll fit right in in Darktow
 You got it All right
 What are you using
 Its Resistance It is a concentration so
that would override your Enhance Ability
 Thats all good no worries Its a little
bit of a juggle All right while this is all
being set up
 You have your
 While you guys begin to set your ways
Fjord You make your way to the Bloated Cup Where
do you head
 Do you want to knock
 At the moment no
 Make a perception check
 No no sign of Bouldergut
 I know
 Make another perception check
 You dont hear anything through the door
 Theres a slight pause and you hear some
rustling and some shuffling A voice goes Who is it
 Who the fuck is this
 Piss off Im sleeping
 There is
 Make a perception check
 Dont hear anything 
 Maybe a faint bit

 You hear some heavy shifting Hi
 Just open the fucking door Okay The
door comes open You see there crunched down in
the room head hunched forward is Bouldergut
whos been holding vigil at the doorway 
Pats you into the chamber You get pushed in
Avantikas sitting on the edge of the bed
currently reading through a book with the window
open outside and goes Quartermaster
 Bouldergut if you would be so kind as to
keep watch on the hallway for a bit Bouldergut
goes Okay If I hear any If you hear
anything dont bother Okay She leaves the
chamber closes the door behind her Closes the
book sets it on a small table
 That is my favorite kind of person
 Going on the better part of a decade We
actually both met when I was first beginning my career
 Well very busy with our attempt to make it
to Darktow and keep things organized in
preparation So Lonely
 A few
 How about I show you instead
 So you begin keeping her busy
 Or she keeps you busy actually would be
more the
 While thats happening you guys made your
way back to the inn Its a very muddied view of
the ship because of the mist but you can still
make out the major details of the outskirts of it
from this far away
 Correct You have So yeah you can
 All right The best new abracadabra
 Theres a brief moment where you feel like
the airs been drawn out of your lungs and you
feel as if youre being suddenly thrust forward
from behind somebody pushing the small of your
back with such intense speed that you feel like
your neck is about to just whiplash terribly
backward Then suddenly you come to a stop and
youre both standing in the middle of Avantikas
quarters on the ship Its dark
 All right
 Whats the range on that
 The range on Message
  feet Hes out of range
 Correct You havent made it there yet
 Yeah because you guys instantaneously
traveled He has a few more minutes before hell
reach range
 You can but theres a lack of color Its
mostly some shades of black and white and gray
 There are two sets of small curtains that
are currently tied off on the sides of the windows
that can open onto the balcony
 As a general note I would like you both to
make a stealth check as you go about your activities
 Just a moment
  and whats your total
 Okay
 You both are  For every piece of
wood that begins to creak as you step because it
is a lot of aged wood that makes up this ship
begins to  you stop yourself and then
shift the foot and you manage to make your way
across here without any of the wood creaking
 There are a number of candles you could see
that theres
 Okay like duvet over the window
 Perception check for Frumpkin Ill say at
disadvantage because of the mist unfortunately
 Okay You can see the torchlight from the
two guards that are on the actual docks and one
of thems keeping an eye out on the water and one
of thems keeping an eye on the docks Theyre
stationed to keep an eye out not just to whats
happening within the actual shipyard but also
beyond as far as they can into the mist for any
ships that are arriving in the middle of the
night But Frumpkin cannot see the people on the
actual deck of the ship
 Yeah All right
 Technically yes Now that you have the
candlelight there gently there quietly
 What are you looking for
 Okay Do you want to each make an
investigation check or do you want to help one or
the other make it
 Then both of you make an investigation
check please
 No you do not
 You took charisma and wisdom so you do
not
 Going through the desk the first thing that
happens is one of the drawers gives you
resistance Its locked The other drawers you
pull open there is blank paper a quill a couple
of small little ink pots The next one beneath has
a folded piece of cloth that you pull out and
inspect It looks like its a cover either for the
desk or something else Youre not quite sure what
the purpose is Checking under the desk you dont
find any other hidden chambers or anything that
marks what you were searching for
 Nott you were looking for
 Glancing around there is a shelf unit with
a number of books on it You pull back some of the
books and look behind it along the back of the
actual bookshelf itself You dont find any hidden
pockets in there Theres a small cabinet
underneath and you open it up and theres a
series of wooden and metal cups wine goblets and
various types of imbibement containers Pushing
through there you do find one panel on the back
thats a bit loose and you slide it off and
behind there you see a small leather book
 Make a
 The weird perceptioninvestigation thing for
traps this is the eternal debate back and forth
Go ahead and consider this a perception check
 It depends Theres a difference between
noticing somethings off and then ascertaining
the nature of whatevers off that would be an
actual trap Since youre looking for traps
specifically for this one and not noticing
something different I would say allowing this to
be an investigation
 I know yeah
 I know It does not appear to be trapped
 Okay You pull the book back and as soon as
you pull back theres a slight tug on it like
something that gives resistance and then comes
free A little piece of cable or twine falls to
dangle from behind one side
 
 This room begins to fill with a very faint
fume
 Looking inside the book theres a bunch of
scrawlings What languages do you know
 You do not recognize any of the languages in
the book
 You put the book inside your pocket
 Okay Make a lockpicking check
  Its not opening
 Okay Make a strength check
 Okay You pull the drawer
 it breaks open
Loudly
 You pull the drawer open look inside It
looks like there are a few small jewelry boxes
that are resting inside
 You take them all
 Okay The drawer do you put it back
 Okay you shove it back in The edges are
splintered It is very apparently physically
damaged You also hear footsteps descending from
the outside of the door
 There is a rug yes
 Okay First off
 Whats your constitution modifiers
 Okay With the little bit of conversation
thats there thats reduced the time youre just
now hitting the time where your breath is starting
to hurt so you both holding it dive down and
then what you
 Okay
 As youre doing this you hear a voice
going Hello and you hear the rattling of keys
You guys by the way youre down now on the lower
deck this is the deck where most of the crewmen
quarters are and youre down in one of the
bedrooms You glance over to the side and theres
a person sleeping in the bed right there the
blanket coiled over Theyre like 
 A bunch of jewelry boxes
 Yeah You look inside and theres a bunch of
jewelry jewels its an actual small jewel collection
 On the person whos sleeping
 Just the one jewel
 Okay all right You hear the door above
open  Hey Anyone The
person whos sleeping is like 
 Okay both of you guys make a stealth
check
 Okay You both quietly duck down
 Your carpet falls down the
guy comes plummeting through hits the floor
 The other guy suddenly goes What
pulls out a dagger towards the other guy who
immediately is like  goes and starts
stabbing into the carpet

 Going What Other ones like Oh god
Pushes him off and stands up and is like
Jesus You see theres a couple of stab wounds
in his chest Zoen what the hell man Waldok
who you saw getting the tattoo earlier from your
turtle friend Hes like Oh Shit Waldok I
didnt know What the fuck dont sneak up on me
He wipes the blood off on the blanket Hes like
Oh jeez What the fuck happened there He looks
up at this perfectlycarved hole in the floor
Doesnt notice the gem Hes like Fuck  Im
so sorry mate I didnt mean Shit what the
fuck happened I dont know Its a fucking
faulty floor or something Fuck Well lets
get you to a surgeon or something He stands up
and rolls off and the blanket falls over next to
you guys  The gem does fall Neither of
them notice it You watch as they shuffle out of
the room and the door closes behind them and you
guys are now in the chamber with the open hole of Avantikas
 You do also hear the coughing of the man who
was stabbed
 Yeah
 As hes inhaled whatever had been released
in the room
 Okay you peek up and look The door that
looks inside of the chamber Okay first off make
a constitution saving throw
 All right so you are considered confused
 Yep
 Ill tell you here in a second whats going
on now You get the sense at this moment that the
other gentleman while coughing managed to resist
the effect of the fume in the chamber You did
not You do notice the doorway is still open
because he just came inside to look and across
the way you see them both coming up the stairs
because theyre making their way up from the crew
quarters to the area near Avantikas chamber
which is right by the deck
 First while thats happening Im going to
go ahead and roll a d
 You can act normally So you can do that
 So you do
 Okay You both head down in the chamber
They walk up past Make a saving throw again A
wisdom saving throw
 Yes Constitution to see that the toxin took
hold and now its wisdom to resist the effect
 Thats another failure Youre both sitting
there quietly as they are walking across in front
 You watch as Nott suddenly her eyes go
wide and she begins to drool a bit and the body
locks up Youre unable to speak unable to move
 You hear now a little bit of raised voices
and you can now hear this on the dock One of
thems going Whats going on The other ones
like I have to get this guy to a doctor he got
stabbed The other voice goes By fucking you
you twat Hes like Im sorry Oh fine
They start leading him off the ship One of the
guards begins to lead them off the docks
 Does Lesser Restoration
 I dont know if it does anything for this
spell
 No That does not affect it so I need you
to make another wisdom saving throw Nott
 You do manage to resist the confusion
effect Aw I was so hoping you were going to
attack her
 Wouldve been fun
 Caleb does not answer
 In the room youre in right now No
 Okay Go ahead and make a performance
check
 Yes you are
 So sorry buddy
 For all that youve been drinking over the
past  hours the tension has caused your bladder
to retain everything and youre barely eking out a
sputtering stream
 There isnt anything to knock over these
are open docks
 All right you guys
 Cant paint on nothing
 Okay you do that and as soon as you do that
the paper falls as a plank of wood
 It takes you awhile to do that Its a few
minutes to paint the wood properly to have the
effect kick in
 You can mark off another two square feet In
the time theyre doing that what are you guys doing
 One of them has already pushed past you with
a wounded man The three of them making their way
while he escorts them off of the docks so theres
only one man left on the dock by the ship He
passes by you as well They dont seem interested
in this
 You feel unsafe in Darktow
 Welcome to Darktow
 He shifts in close and he looks at you real
closely and goes Actually I dont think Ive
seen you around here before
 Were going to go ahead and have a
conversation off the docks Please follow me
 He pats you on the shoulder and starts
leading you off the dock
 Still going Its taking her a few minutes
Youre still doing your distraction Travis
youre doing good
 A few moments pass When you finish
painting the wood falls While thats happening
that moment is occurring you and Yasha in the
tavern are keeping an eye You watch as one of
the crewmates comes walking in rather rapidly and
goes and talks to somebody in the corner that you
recognize from Avantikas crew
 I heard Waldok got stabbed for some
reason
 Waldok
 I know
 Exactly Im curious
 I saw him He got stabbed Right out
there and he points out the door and you can see
him motioning towards the bar
 You seem him bleeding out
 I mean hes not dead but for his level of
life experience hes taken a significant amount
of damage and if left it will probably eventually
get infected
 Go for it and roll
 Thats enough to bring him back You
concentrate on him he winces and you watch as the
wounds close up Theres no mark no scarring He
looks at the wound and goes Mr Clay thank you
very much
 I appreciate that Youre too kind
really Zoen goes See No hard feelings right
and Waldock decks him across the chin Zoen falls
to the ground grabbing the side of his face
 I think Im going to do that He gets up
While thats happening and thats happening and
thats happening
 What are you guys doing
 Okay
 Make a strength check
 It takes you a few minutes
 You have to take your dagger and score it a
bit and then try and press it again Better part
of three or four minutes to try to find the right
edge to bend and break it
 It does eventually break unevenly into three
or four small crumbled pieces
 Only on oneself but yes
 There you go Taking the form of Avantika
and Ipess right
 Okay
 All right
 You guys are disguised
 Make a stealth check sorry a perception
check
 The mist makes it hard to make out much
detail You do notice glancing up there is an
individual in the crows nest
 Id say about  to  feet as an
estimation
 Okay
 All right Whats your DC
 DC  No did not succeed with a natural
eight plus two ten
 In the main mast of the ship that goes up
the crows nest is in itself a circular platform at
the top that is used primarily for keeping a watch
on nearby land and details in the sea around as
well as direction Its a vantage point for
someone to keep an eye on the area around the
ship There is somebody stationed up there to keep
an eye on the ship overnight Or at least there
for as long as their portion of it was You cant
make out the details of the figure from this
distance You just see a figure there
 Okay As you finish the spell a moment goes
by and you hear  Fuck Shit
You look up and you see this individual trying to
bat their cloak on the sides of this before
shouting Help
 While stealthing Or just running
 Okay They have major disadvantage to try
and spot you because theyre distracted by the flames
 Make stealth checks
 Okay You guys both manage to scoot over to
the edge of the ship
 The seaward side All right Youre heading
off
 Itd be the starboard side
 Correct You head over to that which is the
starboard side of the ship Theres the ocean
below you A person screaming up top and getting
more and more frantic
 Yeah unfortunately perception wasnt high
enough
 You both leap off the side into the freezing
cold ocean water
 Still going to make a splash
 Thankfully its mostly drowned out by the
sound of the screaming from the top of the crows
nest As you both break the surface and glance
around the vicinity you can see some of the
torches that are shifting from the other parts of
the dock to come over and see this commotion
thats happening The screams get more and more
intense before they end with a   As
this person felt there was no other recourse with
the flames gathering around them
Then you hear 
 Yeah whoever it was they landed Theyre
alive but theyre not doing that well They broke
something on the way down
 Now the screaming is less frantic and more a
pained scream while the rest of the various
watchers of the dock start making their way over
while you guys are swimming
 Okay so youre probably following under the
docks All right Both of you guys make an
athletics check
 Thats right youre walking
 Actually you didnt have to make it because
youre walking
  All right The water as its coming in
the waves are crashing against the rocky edge and
shore of Darktow Isle right here
 One end of the docks you can hear the
footsteps passing overhead
 They pass by You guys make it over to the
edge of the rocks and with the water pushing you
manage to not be dashed against the rocks to any
point of personal injury You manage to climb up
I need you both to make a stealth check to try to
make your way back onto land without being sighted
by any of the nearby guard
 All right You both are oh youre soaking
wet
 Actually yeah because you dove into the
water before jumping in
 Otherwise youd have taken the impact damage
from that
 Thats true
 Its all good You both climb up on there
dripping a bit wet you especially soaking A lot
of the guards and the torches are making their way
there other ones are still starting to make sure
they arent losing track of their post What are
you guys doing
 Theyre coming toward the screaming and
yelling There are still others there that are
patrolling and keeping an eye They dont all of a
 Thats true
 Its borderline but its starting to calm a
bit Some of them have gotten up there and they
found the hurt guy The spell lasts for how long
 No the
 Correct For one minute so its faded by
now As you guys are walking by you hear the
guards going like Whats wrong Hes like
Ugh Im hurt He looks up and goes But it was
on It was burning What the fuck Hes
confused and in pain and lamenting why he jumped
and whats going on The guards are trying to calm
him a bit and theyre now starting to think
somethings up You can see now somebody is
giving out directions to the other guards
Something is definitely not right and the docks
are now going into heightened search mode
 Okay While you guys are doing that Caleb
you see all this happening
 Yeah Make a perception check
 Yes
  okay Youre just watching this whole
thing unfold
 Youre lead back to the top of the docks
The figure has their hand on your shoulder and
calls over somebody else He goes Hey Waynon
Looks like we got someone whos stowed away here
to Darktow
 He looks over to you and goes Whats your
business
 Make an intimidation check
 Nine He doesnt appear to be shaken by it
but at least he finds a bit of truth to what
youre saying Hes like Let her go
 Dont go wandering these docks at night by
yourself for no fucking reason
 He just turns around and walks away
 You guys start heading back tracking this
trail of seawater behind you on the docks
Eventually Beau you turn around and you see
Molly and Keg walking your way
 All right You all eventually reconvene You
eventually complete your time with the captain
 If you passed by Bouldergut and you looked
down yeah Caduceus is down there Hes actually
in a healthy conversation with one of the members
of the group
 A round is brought to you
 No
 Okay In the shit alley as it has now been
deemed you drop your various disguises
 I mean youre damp
 Okay Good luck
 Okay As you step out of the inn you watch
Nott and Jester walking towards it
 They did
 Beau you probably approached right before
they did
 Fjord youre sitting over and you watch
them all talking just outside of the inn
 I mean there are guards walking
 The commotion seems to have died down at the
moment
 Make a perception check from this distance
Id say with disadvantage from this distance
 Yeah
 Glancing over you dont see any
torchbearing guards but you do see a figure that
is doing a visual pass on the deck of the ship
 You see one thats maybe   feet from
you thats just walking through the street
 Turns around Hey
 I dont know Its not my jurisdiction
tonight
 Probably one of the guys closer to the
ship
 Okay
 Okay
 Make a perception check Or actually this
would be an insight check
 Make an insight check
 You only see one figure you recognize from
the crew
 Okay You only see one figure that you
recognize from the crew and they are recovering
from a series of stab wounds and are deep in their
cups
 Waldok
 He takes it and goes Thanks 
 Attackers Its just fucking him He
points over at the other guy whos just like
Stop rubbing it in Im sorry You fucking jumped
into the middle of my room at night while I was
sleeping What else am I supposed to do Hes
like Not stab me asshole
 Thats Zoen
 Make a deception check
 Okay you talk to them about how youre sad
you couldnt have been there You can see Waldoks like
 Waldoks not really caring as much more
just like No its fucking his fault and
Zoens like Oversharing Caduceus
 One of the guards is keeping an eye over
there with the torch Hes like Yeah it looks
like theres a breakin of some sort a guy was
stabbed got him safe Another man broke his
fucking leg and hes being taken care of
 Sure I guess This way
 He brings you over to the dock and you look
over and theres this guy you know his name is
Bart hes one of the deckhands and hes over on
the side right now just going 
and you can see its snapped Like bone
protruded and everything
 Okay you may have to set the bone first
 Make a medicine check
 You walk up to him and hes like No no no
no
  
  He looks down and you can see theres
a wave of relief on him as he doesnt have this
like protruding fracture Its set Still you can
see the bone but its much betterlooking than it was
 Go for it
 With that medicine check A level two should
be sufficient
 I dont know I was up in the crows nest
and suddenly it
  Suddenly its oh my god Thank you
 It was catching fire I was trying to put
it out but it just kept growing and growing and I
could feel the heat and it was
 I know I dont
 What do you mean
 What
 Make a deception check
 He goes like No I dont think its that
It was sudden and it was intense and then it was
gone Its fucking crazy
 Yeah
  He stands up and like hes leaning
on you for support but once he gets to his foot
its fine and hes like Oh man
 All right You lead him over
 Some of the port guard are like going
through the ship now and theyre going through
 Okay You all gather into one of the
chambers
 Make a perception check
 Lucky seven
 The room seems fairly secure
 Okay It has some sketches in it The
language appears to be some sort of either a
cipher or a personal shorthand What languages do
you know
 Probably yeah
 Okay You open the boxes Theyre a series
of gems some rougher and probably been scrounged
up and found that are with some scrapes imperfect
but still valuable Maybe three of them that are
still well cut and have not been given any
abrasions There is a dull green jade necklace
that does emit a minor magical essence to it
 Make an insight check Make a deception
check
 You can tell that shes lying
 Well say by now youve completed it
 I know So you can respond
 As you go through it its hard to follow
since its shorthand like its broken sentences
and its pieces They look to be notes from
dreams
 It goes through discussions of mentions of
Vandren Mentions of being given the mark The
eye on her person After a ritual that was shown
to her by Vandren the dreams began The dreams
involved this great eye coming to her with
Reward It begins to discuss images that involve
having to fight through dark waters having to
follow signs being promised power with gifts and
actions that show leadership and drive towards
this entity It spoke about Vandren guiding her
and then spoke about him getting cold feet Spoke
on him mistrusting the dreams and his weakness
It spoke on an attempt to then gift Vandren as a
sacrifice but he got away
 Then discusses the search for Vandren For
months and months to no avail Eventually
changing focus to instead continue to improve the
joyous boons and earn the yellow light of the
eye More dreams with patterns of figures in her
way People that were close to her that she felt
were barricades chains that held her back and
getting rid of them Youre not entirely certain
what getting rid of them means but at least out
of the path Finding others that begin to also
learn of the joys and the promise of ruling the
sea and how no matter how much Darktow is the
center of the Revelry and the power of the Plank
King who can possibly not choose to bend the knee
to those who control the oceans they sail on It
then goes on to talk about other notes and
scavenged bits talking about the finding of
Urukaxl Of the difficulties in hiring people that
would go there The hiring of Jamedi to search out
finally over time You find some other notes
about another location from another dream she
had that involves three land masses of different
shapes Theres a few notes and questions around
it but one of them is saying Archipelago
Seems to mark these as a possible
 Then it goes into a few brief phrases about
the newcomers Discussing how the Mist was taken
Its not a lot written in this page
 All it says is Ive found another chosen
Perhaps this one will be more useful than Vandren
 It does not say that Thats where the notes
finish
 It is very unclear
 Its a personal cipher
 Glancing through it looks like you either
learn it here or whatever it would be used to try
to decode it is not present in the book
 You get the sense that this written cipher
is not a verbal language It is specifically
written for her own notes and own purpose
 So you couldnt speak it but if you want to
go ahead and decode it
 Yeah Im saying you couldnt It wouldnt
be able toSorry I misunderstood You couldnt
speak it Go ahead and make an intelligence
check
 Fuck dude Fuck
 What does that put you at a total
 Correct
 Intelligence modifier is eight
 It would be plus five then
 That is exactly the DC you would have needed
to do this It is set at a very hard DC You only
could have done this with a  you motherfucker
 Goddamn it okay All right No here we go
Itll take you the better part of the night You
probably wont sleep which means you wont get
your spells back
 Itll take you the night to complete it You
will not be able to sleep which means you wont
get your spells back and youll suffer a point of
exhaustion
 Im just letting you what would take You
know you can do this
 Immediate excitement and disappointment
 It doesnt have the name Fjord
 Hmm
 Not necessarily
 Well now would be the time to share it if
you hadnt
 Well the safe in the bag you still have
yeah
 The big one you ordered yeah that wouldnt
have gone in there
 Yeah
 All right so whos holding what
 Okay
 All right
 All right so you guys will take sleeping
shifts
 Mark yourself with one point of
exhaustion Caleb You dont recover spells The
rest of you get a full rest
 To each of your doors shortly after
sunrise
 Hes just finishing making most of the
cipher
 All right so you have to have the book to
make the cipher So you go ahead and go find
Jester Are you guys in the same room
 That wouldve been Thats the process that
happened
 You hand it to Jester to go ahead and hide
 How so
 Make an investigation check This would be
perception I guess
 No it only lasts for an hour
  Looking around no The room is shoddy
in some ways but it doesnt have large holes you
can hide gems in
 A voice comes to the room and goes Hey
Wake up
 All right You see Bouldergut out there with
one of the guards and Willow Whisk whos the
cook Jeremiah whos rubbing his eyes Bouldergut
goes All hands on deck
 Company meeting
 Now
 Goes to the next door says the same thing
through the doorway
 All hands on deck Company meeting
 Yeah Yes
 Pets you on the head a little bit
 Eh heh heh Goes to every room and says
the same deal
 Its a long hallway series of chambers
most of the doors closed Looks to be four and
four and theres a stairway that leads up to a
third level
 The next minute goes by and two more
figures show up and they go Were going to the
ship now gather your things Theres no more
waiting Come on
 You get a sense from the vocality here that
things are not right Probably relating to events
that transpired through the evening
 By the way all of your doors now are being
held open and theyre expectantly waiting The
crew doesnt trust you and they havent really
since youve been here Theyre not like Cool
guys lets go Theres very much a Were
getting everybody in there and shit theres going
to be conversations
 You gather your things head outside
Boulderguts keeping a watch from behind Other
members of the crew are being gathered and ushered
in as well as the crew from the Mistake and Orly
Everyones being brought over towards the docks
 You guys at this point have been brought to
the docks now and youre being pushed toward the
direction You can see the Squalleater there
waiting and there a number of figures already on deck
 Make a perception check
 You dont know You dont see anybody
necessarily You have Bouldergut walking behind
you and other people are being ushered in
 Sure
 I dont know I wanted to sleep longer
 I know I want to just eat breakfast
 Make a persuasion check
 Yeah just follows your eyeline over
 Okay so all the jewels  into
the water Okay Make a sleight of hand check
  Okay You drop them off the side As far
as youre concerned no one noticed
 Bouldergut was in the back and there were a
few other First off you have Waldok Zoen are
with you guys Bark you see being brought over
from another side as well It looks like he either
stayed somewhere else or was somewhere else when
he was gathered up by the crew and the guard The
guard only None of them go on the ship but they
lead you over to the edge of the dock and watch
you all go onto the deck and begin to walk away
 Okay You guys walk along the plank up onto
the deck and there you see Avantika Vera the
rest of the crew are all there You can see the
crew of the Mistake are brought to the edge of the
dock and are held there waiting You guys are
brought up on there
 You dont know where the Mistake is docked
You didnt see it when you came in There are
probably plus ships that are all across the
docks here As you guys are brought to the edge of
the ship
 Well youre on the deck right now
 The deck of the Squalleater Avantika sees
you approach and goes Good morning everyone
Good morning Well I apologize for the problems
This should only take a moment to discuss It
appears weve a bit of an incident overnight and
I wanted to let everyone know there may have been
some issues rifling through Over here Waldok was
so unfortunately shivved by one of our
compatriots and shoots a glare over at Zoen
whos like Im sorry Im sorry But it has
come to our attention that there has also been
Well to be perfectly honest a breakin to my
personal chambers
 I know Some of my personal belongings have
gone missing and I wanted to ask if anybody has
seen anything throughout the night I already
spoke with a few of the crew who were here before
I have not spoken with you Waldok Did you see
anything Waldok goes I was sleeping and
suddenly this piece of shit fell through the
ceiling and landed on top of me and I was
just It was the other way around Waldok got
stabbed So Waldok goes I was walking and I
heard some noise inside your chambers I went to
inspect it unlocked the door went in and things
seemed fine but then I fell through the fucking
floor onto Zoen and he was sitting in bed
sleeping and he just fucking started stabbing
me Zoens like You woke me up what am I
supposed to do And where the fuck are we
Anyway we looked at the floor and somebody had
broken the floor probably snuck in somehow The
captain goes Thank you for that Also it
appears that Bark here had strange delusions and
fell Or leapt apparently from the crows nest
Did you see anything in particular Hes like I
mean it was crazy It caught fire and then I
jumped to get away from it and there was no
fire She goes So it appears that there may
have been some sort of distraction Well has
anybody else seen anything of particular interest
last night And by the way Caduceus I heard that
you were very helpful in helping our compatriots
with their wounds
 I appreciate you being a team player
 Oh certainly not To be perfectly honest
whoever did this does not understand the rules of
the city very well
 Hmm Vera Veras sitting back there and
nods You see her fingers trace this weird symbol
in the air that leaves a slight trace Her eyes
flare for a second and she goes But that is
okay Because I can
 Thats where were going to pick up next
week

 Next week we pick up in the shipyard of
Darktow on the deck
 Sorry in two weeks

 Oh my god in two weeks Oh no Curse you
Thanksgiving On the deck of the Squalleater
 It was a pretty good plan There were just a
couple of loose ends
 There were a few moments to possibly discard
a couple of key objects
 This is good but you got the information
you needed and this is going to be a hell of a
start to the next session Oh man I wasnt
expecting it to go this way
 All right well pick up here in a couple of
weeks Were sad we wont see you guys next week
for Thanksgiving What do we have going on over
Thanksgiving
 There we go Were sad well be missing you
on Thursday but on Friday we do have that awesome
 Oh man My hearts pumping
 Well see you guys in a couple of weeks to
pick up from this crazy moment Until then thank
you we love you very much and is it Thursday
yet Goodnight guys
 Welcome back everyone
 Oh I had two noses There we go Thats
much better Thank you Sam for that nightmare fuel
 All right Last we left off the Mighty Nein
had allied themselves with Captain Avantika of the
Squalleater a pirate making her way through the
Swavain Islands in search of ways to unlock this
entity that she was fanatically obsessed with
this Ukotoa which was revealed to be the patron
to Fjords abilities After retrieving one of
these soughtafter orbs from this longreused
temple by the snake folk on the island and
apparently unlocking one of these seals you made
your way back to Darktow on her ship did a bit of
piracy Arrived were introduced to the Plank
King who looks over the Revelry the band of
pirates that helm this side pardon me of the
Lucidian Ocean You then decided to have a plan to
break into the Squalleater at night while everyone
was at rest or some of you at rest Some were
distracting the captain In doing so you managed
to uncover a wellhidden journal of Avantika that
was written in some sort of a cipher
 Kind of like the journal Didnt quite look
like that but artistic interpretation Your
entrance was solid Your exit left a couple of
signs of disturbance but nothing implicating You
returned and through the evening and the luck of
a ridiculous roll you managed to via Caleb
break the cipher on it after knowing what
information was there through your spell and
write a cipher to allow anybody to read the
contents of this journal and see whats within
However the morning in which you awoke you
discovered that the crew at least had seemed to
have noticed all these strange events through the
night The ransacked chamber pointed to some
tomfoolery You were all asked to make your way to
the shipyard to meet with Avantika and the crew on
the Squalleater With not far behind you on the
docks the rest of the crew of the Mistake being
brought as well Upon you stepping up and
encountering this moment of tension it seems
that through Veras glance through some form of
divination magic while some people have guarding
objects or items against themselves being sought
through divination certain objects in pockets are
not free of it They glanced over in Calebs
direction and in that moment you cast Wall of
Fire Before we get too far into this I need you
to place your Wall of Fire for me please on this battlefield
 Okay while youre doing this Im going to
put this up there now the announcements are complete
 Yeah best you can
 Oh youre creating a U
 Okay
 This is it This is the entire thing
 Okay Well place it here
 Well say that he is currently
 That was amazing
 All righty Meticulous placement be damned
 Yeah
 Its fine Liam leave it Leave it alone
Youve lost miniature privileges
 In the final moment we lost one of them up
top too
 Sure Thatll do
 Perfect Now meticulously carefully placed
to not waste anyones time At that moment you
all noticing this moment of tension theres a
flash from Calebs hands Figures their eyes dart
in his direction as he finishes releasing his arms
and firing out of the actual deck of the ship you
see a foot tall high wall of roaring flame and
fire burn around in a Ushape encompassing the
exterior You can feel the heat on you but its
not so intense as to hurt However I need you to
roll damage
 Correct Thats d fire damage if you
dont mind
 Thats a success for the dwarf over there
He takes
 Thats a shame Eight damage for him For
Bouldergut that is a failure
 Mmhmm  for Bouldergut To the guy it got
put on directly thats a failure on his point He
takes a full  points of damage The guy whos
guarding the other plank there thats a failure
on him He takes  Avantika fails with a natural
one Avantika takes a full  Then we have the
guy over there He fails with a three He takes
another  Then Vera rolls a natural  Veras
right there Vera takes eight Now that the Wall
of Fire is in place crackling around you
blackening the surface of the deck the roaring of
its sound as it  roll initiative please
 I prerolled initiative for the guys here to
keep it going  to 
 All right  to  anybody
 We have Jester and Yasha
  to ten
 Fjord at 
 All right Ten to five
 Thats all right Top of the combat round
as the flames are crackling around you hear
screams from crewmen that are too close and having
to pull back and someone starts shouting Fire
off to the side from this side of the docks
Beau youre up first What are you doing
 Isnt it though Thats fine Thatll
work
 No Only an action
 Ill say running up to him and then going
Give me the book him rummaging through it or
you helping him rummage through and grab it Ill
consider that an action because that takes a few
seconds to do Its not something he had ready
Youve moved  feet to get over there and then
your action
 Jester was right next to you when you
started
 Thats another  feet Thats  foot of
your movement
 Okay That finishes Beaus go Avantikas up
next
 She cannot see but what she can do is
Control Water
 Seeing this flames happen she 
pulls back closes her eyes for a second and
raises her scarred hand where the sphere that she
unlocked Ukotoa with raised up At that point
the water from the ocean begins to rise
 All right Its a thlevel spell so I need
you to roll
 She does

 Holy shit You watch as the ocean begins to
swell upwards Avantika raises her arm but you
said the walls are opaque Can you see through the
walls
 Make a perception check

 Yeah it doesnt require you to have seen
the person You know the spells happening you
know the direction of the person You rolled a
high enough perception Ill allow it As you hear
her chanting beneath her breath and you hear the
wave rising you glance over in the direction and
you having an instinctual affinity with flames
and fire can barely see the darkened shape of her
on the opposite side of the flames being warped by
the light Using that moment you put your hand
forward and release the destructive pattern of
your Counterspell With that the swelling ocean
splatters back down to the surface
 As that happens you hear her go Merde
and she begins to back up over to here onto the
side and starts shouting Vera Thats going to
end her turn because that was her action
 Jester
 From where you are right now Its probably
somewhere between  and  feet maybe
 Beau and Jester vanish from sight in a puff
of purplishpink smoke They both are gone Thats
your action
 You suddenly find yourself appearing in the
center of the cobblestone street with The Bloated
Cup maybe about two or three blocks up that way on
the familiar path you know that you took hooking
around the side that led you to the Throne Roost
 You also do notice now that there are some
folks and some of The Revelry watch that are now
glancing over at the very bright inferno that is
this beacon of flame over there in the shipyard
You appear out of nowhere and theres two of them
that look over in your direction noticing you
appear Thats all Thats all that happens You
still have your movement and your bonus
 Okay Good to know That finishes Jesters
go Yashas up
 Youre down two party members in the middle
of a U of flames
 Thats two hours of online research about
Control Water and Wall of Fire and interactions
completely mute That is awesome
 What are you doing Yasha
 If she doesnt make an attack and isnt
attacked she loses her rage
 Okay She scoots by the one guy whos
currently so thatd be   right there
 So she can get there As she swings by the
one guy thats currently in the wall of fire is
like Shit He glances out of the corner of his
eye and sees her go by and he gets one attack of
opportunity swinging at her as she streaks through
the space Thats going to be a  to hit
 Okay In an errant backhand swing shes
got meaty hit points though Thats going to be
eight points of slashing damage to Yasha as she
rushes past
 Okay
 Shes not going to do anything with her
action She can dash with her action and move
again if youre trying to get her to move
  Whats her movement
 All right As she charges past that guard
sees her running and goes Wait Theres a huge
distraction now This person here who saw all of a
sudden the flames erupt who was part of Avantikas
crew one of the crew members is going to take an
attack of opportunity at her as well as she runs
past She is raging though so she takes half
damage Ooh thats going to be a  to hit
 She takes another eight damage but its
reduced to four That finishes Yashas go
Caduceus youre up
 You see Yasha run past you You look over
and you watch as Beau and Jester  Theyre gone
 Well find out Movement  if youre
rushing past her
 There are three ways off the boat Theres
either this gangplank which is closer to you
this gangplank which is further from you but
generally will meet the same distance or jumping
in the water
   gets you halfway on the plank
there
   Youre right behind Yasha
That character does not get an attack of
opportunity on you because they already used their
reaction to hit Yasha
 Okay that finishes your turn Now its
Fjord Aside from Avantika the rest of them
rolled pisspoor initiative which is to your
advantage
 You are currently yes As far as Wall of
Fire goes Im checking the damage on that is
that at the top of their turn
 Oh at the end of each turn
 First time they enter it Got you okay
good to know So if they dont leave that area
 Got you All right cool Thank you
 You are going to begin casting Thunder
Step
 Youre readying it as a spell
 To trigger the instant Nott moves Youve
got it Okay
 Got you He said moves All right that
finishes your go now its Boulderguts turn
Bouldergut angry about the flames goes angry
groan Looking aback batting at them a little
bit with her arm goes and steps through the wall
She takes the damage again Roll another d That
is going to step into the space where the flames
are no longer touching her and on the outside its
not burning
 Yeah they dont get a saving throw by
walking through it She takes your damage Whats
the damage
 Bouldergut comes through singed You see it
as bits of her hair are curled up and red at the
tips from where elements of it have turned to
ember and takes a giant swing with her twohanded
great club at you
 Yeah that is Thats a  to hit
 All right so with that thats  points of
bludgeoning damage Make a constitution save
 Its half or ten whichever is higher So
constitution saving throw
 Only ability checks are at disadvantage not
saving throws
 Just roll one more time
 Fantastic She swings with her second
attack That is  to hit
 That Ooh  points of damage Another
DC make another constitution saving throw
 The flames flicker out as your concentration
is abruptly broken by the ogre that stepped
through the fire wall and twice bashed Ford and
Caleb right there
 That ends Boulderguts turn Now that comes
to Nott and Vera going at the same time in the
same initiative count You have a higher dexterity
than Vera so Im letting you go first
 Five ten  Youre triggering
your
 Thunder Step  Are you going down the
gangplank
 So what do you do now You do
 In what radius
 Within ten feet That will get Bouldergut
It wont get anybody else After slamming her club
twice into Caleb youre holding his shoulder as
the impact is causing him to nearly crumple
against you You lift him up under the arm right
as the spell finishes and 
 You are over here All right
 With a loud heavy burst of thunder
impacts
 Crackling through the air surrounding the
shipyard With that both Caleb and Fjord vanish
and reappear across the distance landing on the
creaking wood of the old rickety dock Hearing the
footsteps behind you of Caduceus and Yasha trying
to catch up the guard all looking confused at
whats transpiring and a little ways down the way
you can see theres about five or six other guards
that are walking alongside the rest of the crew of
The Mistake that are all stopping and seeing
whats going on here Thats the end of your go
You still have  feet of movement
 Okay
 Roll for an attack
 Its not
  You needed a  Yeah that Mage Armor
manages to deflect it
 All right youre right before Yasha With
that Vera is going to take her turn Vera steps
up the side   and is now up on the top
of the ship glancing over as everyone charges
past She raises her arm Come great serpent of
the sea and she raises her hand above and brings
her fingers together into a fist as she brings it
down slowly like theres force against her fist
You watch as this white cloud begins to appear and
hailstonelike shards of ice begin to pelt down
onto the dock below into this radius right here
It does manage to get the guard as well
 What that does is it also turns this area
into rough terrain until the end of her next turn
He is there You guys are all here
 The cloud has vanished now
 However I need you all to make Here we
go Its an Ice Storm spell Dexterity saving
throw from the three of you please If you dont
mind
 Success for you
 Success for you and roll for Yasha as well
if you dont mind
 Yasha fails Yasha takes  points of cold
damage Thats  points to Caduceus and Nott
Although none to you because you succeeded and you
have evasion so you take none
 Thats what rogues can do Yeah whenever
you have to make a dex save against an effect
take half damage If you succeed you take no
damage If you fail you take half You should
read your character sheet
 Yes you may
 So you get to reroll that Once
 Okay so she only takes  However
everything in this for the next round is
difficult terrain as theres now giant hailstones
and sleet slicked all over the rickety docks
 Yes
 Thats going to end Veras go Now it comes
to Caleb
 Hanging over here on the side
 There are two chests off to the side there
 Okay go for the roll on that
 Hes throwing one of the chests over here
 You dart forward across the guards that
are there watching this happen with the rest of
the crew of The Mistake you zip past them in this
blur Flashlike entity They all get pushed back
from the impact as you push through All right
That finishes your turn Now its the
guards The guards
 That guard did take damage
 Hes looking real rough Hes going to back
up out of the middle of the sleet and make his way
this way He looks dazed and is trying to figure
out whats going on and where to ally himself
with You guys go running off the side as the
flames are down Theyre going to give chase This
guards going to rush up here and this guys going
to rush up here Theyre not attacking but
theyre coming out towards you and saying Stop
Stop Halt Theyre shouting towards you guys to
stop The rest of the guards are going to push
forward and start making their way up this
direction and theyre starting to Theyre now
catching up Four of them are going up towards
Fjord and one of them is going back towards Caleb
Theyre starting to gather and theyre putting up
yet but you see their physicality is like we
dont know whats happening but dont you go
anywhere
 That ends their go Its now Ipess turn As
a bonus action hes going to hide and move
underneath and around the rocks to this side and
hes going to pull around from the corner with his
hand crossbow and take a shot at Caduceus from
behind Caduceus whats your passive perception
  okay You do notice him out of the
corner of your eye just barely so he is not
hidden from you This means he does not get sneak
attack damage or advantage on the attack That is
still a natural  on this hit
 Which one
 What does it say Whats the wording
 When you or a creature
 Then yeah
 You channel divinity to prevent the
critical It is now a regular hit Fantastic You
take three points of piercing damage It sticks
into your shield and grinds inside and actually
hits a little bit of the forearm but you manage
to deflect most of the impact and bolt gets caught
in the center of there mostly no damage to you
 One of the guards turns and looks towards
Ipess Actually both of these guards turn and
glance over and having this moment of not entirely
certain which side to go with
 That ends there Its now the rest of the
crews turn Hes going to come to the side there
this ones going to move over to this side there
this guys going to run across this ones going
to move over here and this half orcs going to go
and hide in there
 With that weve got some heavy crossbow
action from this guy and this guy Caleb is out of
range of both of them unfortunately Both of these
guys right here Im going to roll four attacks
One of them is going to be heavy crossbow to
Fjord because Fjord is still within Oh no its
a foot range for the next one
 Yeah heavy crossbow With  feet youre
going to be within the disadvantage range
increment but those things are going to fire at
you Caleb Since youre the one thats the
furthest away
 No
 He does have disadvantage on the attack
though That is a  and a  naturally
 Plus four its going to be 
 That is nine points of piercing damage to
you
 Are you serious
 Caleb  As he darts past this bolt
streaks past  in the back and with
the momentum of his running he crumples into the
ground and tumbles and skids to a halt in the
middle Youre watching this Fjord as this
happens The other one up here at the top of the
crows nest is going to take a shot at Nott
actually You are within the foot range
Thats still a natural two so it misses you It
splinters the wood right next to your foot as you
step out of the way Shards of wood go flying from
the impact and the heavy bolt about that long is
jammed at an angle into the planks before you
This one here and this one are both going to take
heavy crossbow shots Ones at Caduceus and ones
at Yasha so the most visible Against Caduceus
oh man theyre rolling terrible now Thats a
six
 Yeah Yasha however does get hit with a
 I believe Right
 Yasha takes eight points of piercing damage
 to hit eight points reduced to four
 This guy here has a hand crossbow You are
then in disadvantage range Hes going to take
another shot at Caduceus with disadvantage No
thats another six
 Okay thats the end of the crewmen there
Thats the end of the combat round These people
seeing all the fighting are going to duck into
their ship and hide This team on this end they
all move out of the way but theyre keeping an
eye over the side of whats happening Top of
Beau in the middle of this chaos Flames behind
you You hear a thunderous blast that echoes from
behind You glance over you look forward
Jesters already running in the direction Youre
on the rough and tumble rock and elements of
cobblestone that have long worn off and not been
replaced In front of you a little ways up ahead
you can see the tavern
 The Bloated Cup
 Okay so you full run
 In doing so you make it all the way up The
streets there and theres buildings on each
side To the front right of youthis perspective
for you on this side is where you see the tavern
There are folks out there morning drinking like
Whoa Watch you whiz past You make your way up
the street a little further and there are a few
town guards that are looking over towards the inn
the sound and all the craziness happening and
they notice you approaching and they all
instinctively begin to go into a phalanx They all
go shouldertoshoulder and theyre now blocking
off the road from your continual passage No
weapons drawn but in the midst of all this they
see crazy stuff happening and the one person
darting at an inhuman speed away from it and
their instinct is to go Whoa whoa whoa lets
figure this out Theyre not aggressive yet
Thats your turn
 Id say this happens at the very end of your
turn Youre running running running all of a
sudden you stop right as they  right
there in front of you Well pick that up next turn
 That brings us to Avantikas go All right
Oh man Okay Avantika is going to leap down off
the side of the ship Acrobatics check
 No its just difficult terrain
 I will say it would increase the DC for her
landing Ill give you that But she did roll an
 on her acrobatics check
 Leaping down lands right in front of Nott
Skids down lands a few inches back before coming
to a stop The ice grinds at the back of her foot
and creates this little pile where the momentum
eventually stops holding her rapier in one hand
and the dagger in the other looking down at you
Nott goes Ah you should not have crossed me
Shes going to take three strikes at you two with
her rapier and one with her dagger The dagger
you can see now is Youve seen it a little bit
in the battles You were in dark spaces so it was
hard to make a real distinguishing visual of it
but out here in the open air as shes clutching
the dagger aggressively theres a faint black
energy faintly drifting off the edge of the blade
The attack with the rapier first one natural
four no its going to miss you Natural three
Both rapier shots nothing The dagger however
thats going to be a  to hit
 Okay Shes rolling real bad As the two
rapier shots you dodge out of the way but she
uses that to feint forward and jam the blade up
into the front of your stomach and rib cage area
That is going to be nine points of piercing damage
and an additional eight points of necrotic damage
 Okay
 Yeah it would halve both from the attack
so take eight points of damage You manage to push
away with your momentum the blade doesnt sink
quite as deep and you grabbing the wrist
preventing it from really coming to the hilt in
your chest you pull away Thats going to end her
turn She shouts over her shoulder and goes
Vera we need friends Jester your turn
 You saw Beauregard dart up past you
 If you look a little bit ahead of you
around each of the buildings that are right in
front of you there are alleys that curve around
that would eventually meet in the road that you
guys are currently running down
 Yes but youd have to move up You probably
wouldnt be able to get to an alley to do it this
turn There are people around There are folks
that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance
 Okay make a deception check
 Youre a little ways up Ill roll a
perception check for them how about that
 Thats a cocked roll The guards
unfortunately do not hear it Theyre not as
perceptive and their focus is distracted between
this and they hear shouting but theyre not
picking up the words However some of the folks
nearby glance over at you and go Oh shit
really Finishes his drink real fast
 Ive got to go see this They seem less
worried about their lives and more like Oh I
want to go see how this goes down
 Theyre not around In front of you theres
one coming out of a building and you see a couple
folks that are on the front porch entrance area of
the tavern
 Its up to you What are you doing
 Okay Jester you turn around and start
heading back towards the group Its a long run
because you went  feet from the ship
 You go for it That finishes your go
Yashas up
 Shes going to use her reaction to parry
which adds a plus two to her armor class
 That misses
  hits
  points of damage to Avantika As the
blade carves through she tries to parry it with
the rapier but it slips down and carves a slight
bit off of her forearm before it gleans off and
you can see a little bit of red immediately
exposed where the cloth was carved through and a
little bit of the skin and flesh removed with it
 Okay thats going to be  
Thats as far as she can get
 Difficult terrain yep
 As an action you can angel of death
 Theyre more for the surprise party factor
than the actual flight thing
 Okay that finishes Yashas go Caduceus
youre up
 Theres the guards there Theres Avantika
Avantika does not have a reaction she already
used it to parry
 Correct
 Ill say for the purposes of keeping tabs on
you this will be your marker
 No its your ability As soon as you cast
something you lose your invisibility
 Actually let me check the wording on that
if its different from the actual spell because
usually its
 Can magically turn invisible until the
start of your next turn or until you attack make
a damage roll or force someone to make a saving
throw You can cast a spell as long as it doesnt
damage or attack somebody
 Or force someone to make a saving throw
 It would be  feet with this
 
 You can go at an angle in front of Yasha
 That ends your go Caduceus Fjord youre
up Your friends are catching up behind you
theres a sleet storm slamming theres guards
swarming around your direction telling you to
halt and up ahead of you you watched a speedy
Caleb grind into the ground What are you doing
 I wasnt sure if you had taken this spell I
prepared for it just in case
 This is it
 Youd be just on the edge of the ship
there
 With the dark speech that emanates from
inside of Fjords body it echoes out like a
weird discordant harmony of several voices youve
never heard For those that are present You guys
are way the fuck away
 Theres the sound of reality cracking and
you look up and watch where in the center of the
sky there at the very edge of The Squalleaters
deck two large meaty hands pull open this
barrier between the realms and stepping out you
see this large gorillalike demon covered in fur
and horns at the edge these giant fists with
tusks that emerge from beneath this chin and these
red burning coallike eyes As it steps out it
turns right towards Vera whose eyes are wide and
 in her face You watch her hair get blown
back a bit spittle across her chin Thats your action
 All right you manage to Misty Step
 Okay This puts you
 Correct You went  feet forward and you
still have your movement
 Okay so you go heading towards Caleb After
shouting Avantikas not to be trusted after
summoning a fucking demon Im going to ask you to
make a persuasion check with disadvantage Because
you just summoned a fucking demon
 All right Well they seem to be more
focused on what just appeared through the scar in
reality you left All right so you charge past
Youre coming upon the group of guards now that
are around the rest of the crew of the Mistake
but theyve forgotten about that crew at that
point They saw Caleb rush past Two of them went
over to figure out what the hell happened as he
basically darted football fumbled off to the
side The others are turning and coming towards
your direction but its not their turn yet
 All right that finishes your go Fjord It
is now Boulderguts go
 You do yes
  right after Avantika
 Oh man
 Correct When you summon it on each of its
turns thereafter you issue a verbal command to
it so you can keep issuing commands every turn
However it doesnt go until its next initiative
All right Thats real interesting
 So Boulderguts going to move 
Im going to make a saving throw for the now
partiallydamaged okay yeah thats fine
 The plank is going to snap Gets her about
there and is going do the dash up here The next
two guards who were now focused on Bouldergut
coming forward and theyre not entirely certain
whats happening Theyre focused on the demon
Theres weirdness from all sides It seems the
watch are not used to this chaos breaking this far
in towards Darktow Usually the reef and the
defenses they built around the reef are enough to
keep things like this far from the island That
finishes Boulderguts turn That brings us to Nott
and Vera but Nott you get to go first
  Youre next to Yasha with your
movement
   
 You are and you still have your bonus
action
 Okay
 Whats the save
 Natural five
 Shes very good at a few things but she
doesnt have the highest intelligence to get to
that point
 Shes smart but not that smart
 I went to public school
 Its a giant it looks like it once was a
mast of a ship thats been whittled down into a greatclub
 Okay All right Avantika glances over and
 For a moment you see a look of relief
come over Avantikas face
 All right Is that your turn
 You got it Now its Veras turn Vera
seeing this happen Oh man
 All right Veras going to glance off to the
side Actually shes going to try to move out of
melee of this barlgura
 Yeah
 So make a strike
 Nine misses
 As the giant demon swings outward it
impacts and deflects off the energy field of Mage
Armor that pushes it off to the side Vera steps
back The reach on that is five foot right For
the attack Just making sure
 Okay she pulls out of it and goes harsh
sigh Looks down at Avantika looks down at all
the guards that are gathering as theyre moving
in

 Just barely from that angle there
 Yeah that does it All right she goes
after hearing what Avantika said goes Everyone
they have crossed Darktow Take them to the Plank
King You watch as shes saying these words her
hand sends this strange series of symbols through
and casts Mass Suggestion on the guards in the
vicinity of  feet of her
 Yes
 Fail Fail Fail Its working out great
Its like two seven four three Ten fail
Natural one
 All of them failed You watch as all of
these guards have the confusion suddenly
crystalizes and all of them look towards your
group and start shouting Stop them Theyre thieves
 Vera after casting that is going to use
the rest of her movement  Oh god
 Ill put her there its fine All right
that ends Veras turn Caleb for your turn make
a death save Its the beginning of your round I
keep forgetting its the beginning of your turn
in case you roll a natural 
 Cool Thats one success
 All right
 At the end of Veras turn this goes away
 The sleet and stuff has now melted and
dripped off the sides These guards here
   on each side and theyre both
going to attempt to grapple Yasha Go ahead and
make an athletics check for her She has advantage
because she is raging
 Yeah one guy fails to grapple Then the
other guys going to attempt to Make another
check She has to beat a 
 Yeah they just cant they try and grab
her and she shrugs them off no problem These
other guards here begin to swarm up to try and
grab Nott This ones going to move up and try and
grab Yasha This one here is going to He tries
to move forward towards Yasha and ends up
chestbumping space in the middle of the air and
confusedly is going to try and grapple whatevers
there He has disadvantage on that so first Im
going to do that with you Rolled really well with
disadvantage natural  and a natural  Make an
acrobatics or athletics check to see if he doesnt
grapple you
 Okay

 No no no He tries to grab you and he
gets ahold of you and you push him off and he
looks really confused He grabbed something
before he really knew what was happening and is
really confused For a moment he thinks it was a
ghost
 For the one that rushed up to try to grab
Yasha again because the other guys failed ooh
natural  So roll for her Its going to be a

 She is currently grappled by this guy Hes
now grabbed and is holding her in place Shes
 The two other guys are going to try to
dogpile in to try to stop her from moving We have
three attempting to grapple you Nott
 Yes
 All right so first guy
 You roll an acrobatics check against them
 Thats a success Next guy natural 
 Thats 
 Oh my god All right all right So he
manages to actually grab The first one youre
just too slippery Oh god You turn on the
side The other guy grabs you Right as he
squeezes you just jump out of it land on his
arms and then step off The third ones going to
try and grab you Thats a six Go and roll
 Okay you still manage to slip away None of
them can grab you Youre too fast Tiny goblin
form Quick Nab her Youre jumping around
darting around squeezing out of the way No
impact All right that finishes the guards turn
Ipess is going to  try to hide at the
top of it Ooh natural  So hes going to
scoot up around the side dart off the edge Hes
going to make a shot at the barlgura who has
shown up With advantage that is going to be a 
to hit Whats its armor class
 Okay He does get sneak attack damage
against it
 Thats an additional d so
  points of piercing damage Does it have
any resistances
 Damage immunity to poison Thats all
 Got it No immunities to nonmagical
weapons
 Okay just making sure All right yeah so
it takes full damage on that Mark that
 Yeah Thats going to end Ipesss turn Now
its the crews turn This ones going to make a
step back trying to get out of range of the
barlgura It already used its reaction to do an
attack Its going to reload and fire with its
crossbow against it Ooh thats going to be a 
to hit
 All right It suffers eight points of
piercing damage
 These guys here are going to fire down after
reloading Theyre now focusing on the giant
demon Theyre not focusing on you guys so
 Theyre turning like Oh Jesus
 Hes going to move over here and attempt to
fire at it from there This ones going to stand
where he is and reload These guys are going to
spin around and focus on this terrible creature
All right This guy here is going to stay behind
Thats  six shots against the barlgura
 So all right  to hit
 One point of damage
 Nine to hit
 All right Seven to hit
  to hit
 Nine points of damage
  to hit
 Seven points of damage
 The last one is  to hit
 That finishes the crews go as theyre all
laying into this demon that appeared on there You
watch as  as it turns back to yell all of
a sudden it gets another bolt in the chest and in
the side Its getting all of these bolts that are
now sticking out of its body as its raging
angrily on the deck of the ship You can see now
theres a giant burned U on the side It wasnt
around long enough to catch the ship on fire but
there is a dark scarring on the base of the deck
there All right One more round and it wouldve
caught fire
  That wouldve been great
 Oh man All right that ends Top of the
round All right so Beau The guards are there
in front of you right now Theres three of them
shoulder to shoulder and theres one of them that
looks the one in the center is a little
betterarmored They go Hey Miss Miss where
are you going Theyre looking at you and both
looking at whats over there
 Make a persuasion check
 No because its honest
 There was nothing about that statement that
was incorrect
 Youre not sure if he believes you but hes
not aggressive if that makes sense He goes
Well be that as it may we need to figure out
whats happening before we can have you running so
quickly with intent
 Well send for him Stay here and the two
other guards stay there and hold the position and
fill in the space He turns around and starts
making his way towards the Throne Roost
 He goes Ah Ive got it and he continues
walking
 Well say that youve used an action at this
point You still have your bonus and your
movement if you want to use it
 Its up to you You can go along with it and
stay there and wait for your friends or anything
else you want to try They are not aggressive at
this point theyre just holding the line
 The tension in your body is rising up and
for a second the muscles bulge and the veins
begin to pop from the sheer amount of adrenaline
thats in your system and your urge to charge
through You just breathe heavily as your entire
form sinks into it The two guards you can see
their tension as their hands were going for a
weapon drop They both go into a watching but
waiting pose That ends your go
 Its now Avantikas turn Avantika sees the
guards shifting their allegiance under the effect
of this Mass Suggestion spell Shes going to turn
and attempt to go after Yasha
 What
 Yeah
 Good Shes making three strikes against
her because shes the one closest to it Yeah
shes not too hurt Shes not doing anything
defensively Or you know what
 No Yashas being held As far as she knows
Yasha is doing okay or the guards have her Nott
is the one that keeps darting around so shes
going to raise a hand and cast Eldritch Blast at Nott
 Ooh thats  to hit
 You take three points of force damage As
youre jumping off suddenly you get hit across
the chin but its a glancing blow and your world
goes a little dizzy for a second The second one
misses entirely
 Yes
 She didnt roll very good on the damage
 Technically a grapple is an attack yeah
Shes going to use her movement to back up five
six going towards this backing up towards the
ship
 Correct Instead of doing that she stayed
back to do that and is now looking up towards the
demon that is raging onto the base of the ship
Seeing the guards have got this under the
Suggestion spell she seems to be backing off
slightly Thats going to finish Avantikas go
Now its the barlguras turn
 Ohhoho
 Because it can do that
 Go for it
 Yeah that hits Roll damage on that one
 Okay good to know She does succeed on her
constitution save with a natural  She does
every time she takes damage to see if she can
maintain her Mass Suggestion
 That hits Roll damage
 All right Natural  succeeds on the
save
 Her con bonus isnt that high so its just
a straight roll on the d
  does hit All three hit
 Thats a natural ten just barely makes it
Does not drop concentration But took some hits
Veras looking a little roughed up and scared as
shit She runs down the stairs and turns around
and sees this thing  It starts roughing
her up Shes thrown against the back is pummeled
into the side of the ship and is trying
desperately to look for a way to escape
 That ends the barlguras turn I need you to
take a charisma saving throw for it
 Correct
 Correct and then it returns to its home
plane
 Well no you havent lost concentration on
it yet It stays for the hour but then once you
lose concentration roll a d to see how many more
rounds it stays
 Nope
 No worries That ends the barlguras turn
Jester youre up
 Youve ducked to the side Youve cast
Disguise Self on yourself
 Okay
 Make a deception check
 Okay People in the nearby streets that are
seeing this go like Are you serious That crazy bitch
 A few people nearby take this and go Oh
oh and start going inside to avoid this Other
folks are getting angry and throwing their glasses
on the ground and Oh I knew one day Ugh
Theyre pissed and going to grab their things and
maybe start a militia against her We dont know
Youve rallied the corner
 There are guards rushing towards the action
thats happening behind you and there are a few
that are Theres a bunch now making their way
towards this intersection
 Okay Youre up ahead and you hear this in
the back but you dont know its Jester You just
hear a lot of shouting so youre like Oh man
my deception worked other people are yelling this
 Perfect
 That finishes Jesters turn Its Yashas
go Yasha is currently grappled but you can still
make her actions She has to use an action to
break free if she wants to to move but otherwise
her movement is zero But she has advantage
because shes still raging
 All right make an athletics check with
advantage
 He got a six
 So the guy managed to luckily grapple her
last turn She just flicks him off Hes like
Ow So shes free of the grapple
 Okay
 All right that ends Yashas turn
Caduceus
 Yes you do
 They all 
 You can Bless yourself
 All right That gives you d
 There you go
 Okay so that ends your turn Or what else
you doing
 Theres no attack He looks startled and
his hands are forward to try and Theyre not
weapon drawn to bludgeon you but theyre trying
to keep you from going anywhere
 From where you are there  from there
about  feet from you
 Hes going to attempt to stop you
 No Unfortunately you may not know this
they are currently magically compelled
 You would not know that
 As youre trying to tell him this and trying
to scoot by he like
 He heads you off of the pass and is saying
Stay put
 Stay put
 Hell deal with it Stay put
 The other way
 Okay Theres other guards here that are
 Okay Hes still trying to maneuver around
 Fjord youre up next
 There you go All right Fjord its your
go
 Yeah with the Misty Step and the movement
you had So you are  feet from him
 As you do you rush past some of the guards
that are on the opposite side that were rushing
towards you Theres I believe at this point
four of them that were heading your direction
because there was the one that was going towards
Caleb So well say two of them youll have to
push past They both are going to make attacks of
opportunity on you Just an attempt to grapple to stop
 Make your acrobatics or athletics check to
try and break free
 That succeeds They literally rolled a
natural  plus two  was the highest roll The
other rolled a two You manage to shrug past You
push out of his grasp Hes like Hey wait
 Well no you
 All right So you come to consciousness on
the ground
 Well Now its Boulderguts turn
Boulderguts going to move up shove past and
begin to take a giant club towards the barlgura
Down towards it
 First hit is a  to hit
 Others an 
 Both hit okay First hit is  points of
bludgeoning damage
 The other one is  points of bludgeoning
damage
 Avantika see what
 Yeah Its really confusing
 Shes like No What are you doing But
shes used to Bouldergut not being the brightest
 Whats that
 Oh reckless Thats right yeah No A four
and a two So both of those worked out fine
Thats the end of Boulderguts turn Boulderguts
slamming onto this demon going Go to sleep
Dont hurt my friends Finishing her go it is
now Notts turn
 Yes and theyre all hands on their
weapons trying to subdue you and grab you
Theyre now shouting Stop Halt I say guards
Theyre all volunteer pirates of The Revelry that
help keep watch on the shipyard here
 No the ones from the ship are further this
way and they were being brought by guards but
theyve been left alone to focus on you guys
Yasha currently is stopped and theyre all very
much in a stay there type position Theyre in
the process of subduing their quarry
 Gotcha
 You slip past and make your way up towards
Fjord and Caleb With your disengage and your
movement and your action you can make your
way
 Yeah  feet From there that would put
you not quite to where they are but it gets you
up to where the other guards were that he rushed
past and just beyond them because disengaged
they dont get any attacks of opportunity All
right that ends your turn Vera is looking not
too great Vera is going to
 Is going to cast Scorching Ray against the
barlgura Shes going to attempt to take a step
back up the stairs Barlgura does get an attack of
opportunity on her
  just hits Just hits
 Ten points of damage ugh All right makes
it Natural ten again Doesnt break the spell
 Shes having good luck with those rolls
Takes it climbs to the top spins around is
going to Scorching Ray towards the barlgura
Thats ds against it Okay thats going to be
  and 
 To hit
 No All right Not a great damage roll The
balgura takes  points of fire damage
 Caleb youre up
 You wake up come to consciousness on the
ground Fjord is getting you up You look over
your shoulder and you can see theres a whole
shit ton of guards in the area that are subduing
Yasha Caduceus seems to have put his hands up
 From the boat From now youd be about 
feet
 Correct
 Yeah
 In your state where do you want to put
it
 You dont know Where are you putting it
 At the mast All righty As you wake up you
spin fire This ray streaks past All the guards
who are calm at this point see this happen and
watch the streak go by and detonate on the ship
The bright flash of light echoes against
everybodys faces as the impact hits Go ahead and
roll damage
 Yeah totally man
 Thatll go well
  good rolls
 Okay so Bouldergut thats a fail
Boulderguts looking rough
 Just a strawberry scrape All right this
guy Whats the DC on it
 It should be  I think Its eight plus
your proficiency plus that
 All right so he succeeds He rolled a 
so he takes  you said So  points of damage
to him Oh hes dead Hes fucking done He took
damage from the Fire Wall earlier
 Yeah That guy he makes his save but he
dies too
 This guy doesnt make his save hes dead
 Roll for the barlgura
 Yeah the barlgura is destroyed Vera
thats cocked
 That is  does not succeed Vera takes 
damage Veras almost dead is burned incinerated
on the ground not moving
 Concentration spells lost
 It doesnt work like that unfortunately
But their compulsions no longer there
 Yeah With that the spell fades Vera
crumbles to the ground barlguras gone giant
explosion The mast leans slightly to one side
from the impact This guy was out of the radius actually
 Id say if he hit the mast Id say it hit
him actually yeah
 Ipess has to make it as well He fails so
he gets incinerated
 Ipess does make it I need you to make a
wisdom saving throw Caleb
 No the DCs real high on this one
 As you go conscious you watch as bodies go
flying off the side and fall limp to the side of
the dock their bodies still smoldering but
unmoving You start flashing back to a very
painful memory and Calebs eyes glaze over You
are currently stunned
 Okay that ends Calebs turn The guards
that were calm are no longer calm As they see you
do this the guards that were behind you charge
in and all grapple both of you Are you resisting
 No all right You are dogpiled and
grappled
 All right Damn
 Ipess looks around at the destroyed crew
saw Vera go down and runs up to try and see how
shes doing The remaining crew which is just the
one here and this one here
 Boulderguts still alive barely Barely
 Currently the books still in her hands
There was no variation in that
 The book is still held there in her hand
Okay thats going to end the crews turn Coming
back to you Beauregard as youre just waiting
You keep waiting
 Dont do anything funny They turn around
and start walking with you
 Theyre  trying to keep up a
bit
 Avantika takes a quick glance at the
scenario and opens the hatch and charges inside
of her ship
 At this point unless anyones going to
resist combat comes to an end and we are now at a
role playing point At that moment well take a
break Unless you were doing anything
 Well take a break in a second then
 Because when it gets to Notts turn
 Okay If thats the case there are four
guards now No because now two of them have
changed direction to go towards you and help
subdue you guys Theres two after you now
Theyre both going to attempt to grapple you and
stop you Make two acrobatics checks
 Ten on the first one
 Both fail actually
 Yeah that was a  and an 
 This was as you were charging through there
and on their turn they moved up to you
 Your movements zero you cant escape
Well say that happened on their turn so on the
beginning of your turn youre grappled You can
attempt to break free if you want to
 Actually thats an interesting point Let
me pull up my new fancy Players Handbook
 Unintentional commercial but these are so
awesome
 I think theyre brickandmortar only so
youve got to go to actual game stores
 It doesnt say Ill say make a check and
well see if its high enough for each of them
 No They hold tight you cant move Your
movements zero Theyre both clutching you there
on the side
 Okay With the chaos now coming to a stop
and Nott prevented from escaping though that
would have been a fun chase sequence now well go
to a break
 Man that was really intense
 Oh there was a few things there that went
differently than I expected
 Before we go to the break we have our

WonderfulMouse Well get that sent to you ASAP
 Diving back in As the rest of you stand
there amongst the shipyard docks subdued by the
harbor watch The Revelry watch there More
gather and more gather Id say about half the
watch of this city the volunteer mercenaries that
take their shifts to keep their eye on their
island little haven there all flood the docks to
see what the hell just went down You look up and
see the blackened charred sails of the ship
treated against weathering but still darkened
from the blast of the fireball the wood itself
darkened and splintered in places You can see
that giant burned U that marks the deck
Everything is held in place Youre making your
way to the guards What are you doing Jester You
see Beau being led up by the guards towards the
Throne Roost
 Oh yeah you saw and heard the distant

 Okay The guards have now pulled you all to
your feet and have begun to apply manacles to
your hands Not anything too aggressive but for
the purpose of safety and to maintain the order
within this community theyre particular and
careful They also go onto the deck and you see
them beginning to collect the bodies of those that
were killed Bouldergut is inconsolable and
furious and it takes a few guards to get her to
calm down Avantika is having a conversation with
a couple of the guards You guys are being pulled
away from the docks towards the city As you are
brought towards the edge of it one of the guards
adorned a little better than the rest have a
brief discussion You overhear one of them say
Hold tight apparently someones going to get the
Plank King While you guys are all waiting and
youre going to convene with the rest of your troupe
 But go and find the vicinity
 There are many lookyloos on the edges of
the shipyards here The docks make up probably a
good third of Darktow Before you actually get the
edge of the cliff where the city itself is built
on different areas and platforms and the streets
all rise at a perpetual grade as it is embedded
in the side of the cliff There are folks who are
looking over to see what happened Usually this
kind of stuff does not go down within the city
You can see that people are excited and worried
and making up their own stories and what they
saw One of them is like It was crazy A demon
fell from the sky and slammed into the boat and it
was intense The rumors are going crazy
 Thats a thlevel spell Summon Gwar
Concert
 You can probably all they do round you up
However as soon as you begin to make any physical
action towards spellcasting
 Its only verbal
 You tell them youre going to cast a spell
 No spellcasting
 Dont want any funny stuff
 They have after manacling taken your
weapons The individuals are carrying them at
their side Not yours They couldnt find yours
 They have your crossbow and theyve taken
your shield and your staff
 There is a small perimeter being held but
you could get probably within   feet or so of them
 Okay
 Make a performance check to see how subtly
you can no this would be deception Make a deception
 As you begin to subtly try and sneak your
verbal components of your spell into the
were making sure theres no casting this close to
it if you dont mind
 Its best not to get involved Terribly
sorry about that
 Nah thats it
 Hes telling everyone Please hold tight
Dont worry Were taking care of it
 Anyway about  or so minutes pass for the
rest of you As make your way up the steps now
trying to jaunt you manage to catch up to the
armored fellow who now acts as the tip of the
spear essentially Now youre flanked and to the
front although the flanking has to shift as the
space for the steps ascending to the Throne Roost
get only wide for one person at a time You are
being held at that point You make your way up to
the Throne Roost to the shelf of stone There you
see standing at the edge is the Plank King
himself blackened curls still dangling around his
massive goliath head his long coat billowing
slightly with the bit of wind thats whipping
around the side of the cliff face The morning fog
is burning off of the nearby reefs and you can
see a little bit further out The sky itself is
still dull gray Looks over and goes That was
quite the display wouldnt you say The guard
goes Right sir One of them we found at least
someone running from the bit who says they have
information for you He goes Oh yeah no I
recognize this one Step forward
 So whats all this
 If you dont mind tell me whats going
on
 He flips through the pages This is
gibberish
 He glances through the paperwork looks at
you giving him this sly grin and goes You
newcomer into these waters spent less than a day
amongst our people and have already attacked and
stolen from one of our own as well
 Well well see what she has to say to
defend herself as well Hang tight with me here
with these men The rest of you get the rest of
your guard Bring her friends and bring Avantika
and who else had survived that massacre up here to
the roost
 I dont trust anyone and I trust more
those that Ive mistrusted for years than those
Ive only come to mistrust and know right now So
well see where it all lies Be patient If what
you say is true then weve got all time in the
day
 I dont read a fucking piece of this but
Ive got a few friends who are more of a
pageturning type
 Because I wanted to see if youd actually
do something Remember we dont turn on pirates here
 If youre right then Ill judge you based
on the fact that you broke our law as soon as you
got here and Ill weigh it versus how positive
this tells me Theres not enough well maybe you
and Avantika will find yourselves out there on a
pike of warning
 Make a deception check
 Okay He nods a bit
 Sos this one He snaps his fingers and
you see a cloaked figure step out of the shadows
the same cloak that passed you on the stairs the
night before
 Its Jamedi hood pulled back
 At which point the Plank King steps up
towards you now looming over you a good two and
a half feet of height on you This imposing
presence wide like a mountain glancing down at
you with a grin You can smell his early morning
breath of rotting teeth and whatever he had the
night before pulsing from his grin He goes I
have to say for someone so small youve got some
serious balls
 And if you survive Im sure it wont be
the last All right Lets go see your friends
 If this is right lets hope you didnt
blow up too much of her boat itll be yours
 If its enough
 The guards now turn and spin you around and
push you back down the stairs as the Plank King
follows behind Jamedi keeping a close watch He
goes and shouts something off to the side He
goes Solon Im going to need your brain for
this one Come on You hear a voice go All
right Im coming
 Solon SOLON Coming around the corner
you see a human man probably in his late s
early s Bit of an unkept puff of a chin goatee
his hair thinning in this big widows peak gray
to white These big spectacles around his eyes
and this tattered thin mustache thats attempted
to be curled into a handlebar but it seems to
have split in places and is not very well kept He
has this big green cloak thats wrapped around
his shoulders that is so much material and
billowing so widely it makes his head
comparatively look much smaller Hes clutching a
bag and hes getting his stuff Wait here Im
getting my stuff Ugh They keep walking and
eventually you see him trying to catch up from
behind  You take it this was probably
what the Plank King was referring to as his
bookish friend
 As you guys are all patiently waiting here
looking amongst yourselves is there anything you
wish to do or are you succumbing to the hope that
Jester Beauregard andor possibly the Plank King
comes to situate this Eventually you see
Avantika brought up from the ship in manacles as well
 No they shut that down
 Its not quite long enough to be a short
rest
 Actually you know what No its about an
hour of short rest I give that to you
 For the travel of Beau to the front and the
rest of the guard to get there for the Plank King
conversation for him to descend the Throne Roost
to make his way through the city to the docks
yeah thats over an hour
 Okay As Frumpkin appears on the shoulder
one of the watch goes Oh whered you come from
little one Didnt even see you come in Begins
scritching Frumpkin
 Doesnt even talk to you Just looks at
Frumpkin Whos a cute little kitty We dont get
cats much on this island Its good to see one
Wonder what ship you came aboard

 Eventually as the crowd begins to part you
see a number of the guard a few of the bodyguards
that you had seen previously sitting amongst the
shadows of the Throne Roost when you first arrived
the night before You guys came roaring into this
town you definitely did There you see Beauregard
being flanked by three guards one betterarmored
than the others and then there stepping behind
that the looming figure of the Plank King He
approaches So not here but  hours and youve
already made a mess of our little home have you
I could see the flames from my Roost My crows
men tell me they spotted you walking aboard the
Squalleater and assault Avantika one of our own
Apparently a few of you fleeing into the city You
know I have my misgivings about trusting anyone
but Im far more likely to toss in with those that
Ive mistrusted long enough to at least know where
they stand I dont know a fucking bit about all
of you So my other friend and he points
towards Jamedi whos now in the back and the
rest of you see  says that youve all come in
with her lot naught but maybe two weeks back and
that not most of you have much of an experience on
the sea naught but one The rest of you still
havent quite found your legs on the waters Im
going to ask you right now what brought you out
there to mucking with the pirates deals Speak up
 He reaches back in his pocket and goes Oh
right Here and gives it to Solon who goes
Oh all right This is not a language I really
know
 Oh yeah
 He takes it and pulls it out looks at it
Oh fuck me this is
 Sir with all due respect its going to
take me a long while to do this This is elaborate
 The Plank King goes Shh
 You said theres some special parts here
of looking to overturn me or something What pages
are that at
 Solon goes Oh Id very much like to have
a conversation with you
 You point out the space where that was
 Thumbs through and he goes
 Okay O great king give me a bit of time
with this if you dont mind He looks around
Everyones looking at him At this moment he
glances around and sees the dozens and dozens of
eyes locked on him and he starts getting a little
nervous You see a little sweat drop on his
forehead and he adjusts his glasses again
Theyre starting to fog a bit He goes clears
throat plops down and starts going through and
pulls out paper and a quill He sets up in the
middle of the dock area and starts going through
and pointbypoint deciphering and translating
each part of the cipher over to one of his empty
pages
 That we do
 Oh were standing right here
 You still havent answered my question
What brought you to these waters Whyd you throw
in with her lot You see now theyre bringing
Avantika forward with the rest of you
 Where does your allegiance lie
 His eyes narrow Make a deception check
Ill say with advantage because you did drop the
Cobalt Soul In particular with the Plank King
that has meaning
 Insight check
 Yes for you
 The Plank King nods and goes
 Yeah you barely see through Theres a hint
of truth and theres a hint of not so true Its
a halftruth
 The Plank King nods and goes Ah the
Archives Ive had some dealings
 Not much of a reader But your folk have
done good work for our interests in the past So
Its the woman of the hour What have you to say
about yourself when these strangers have come
waltzing into our little haven and causing all
sorts of ruckus Murdering your crew and making
these claims against you Known you for years
Avantika hand behind in shackles goes Well
Her face you can see bits where dirt sweat lines
have made their way across and down the sides of
her chin and jaw Looking intently at the rest of
you with a forced smile through her teeth there
is a look of murderous rage and loss in her eyes
as you have murdered a majority of her crew She
goes Well I can guarantee that I kept no
journal They came to me at sea with discussion of
perhaps coming and joining my crew looking for
means of aid and gold They began to talk of this
strange entity this Ukotoa Well I followed
suit I wanted to make for some kind of alliance
I found particular interest with one of their
individuals She looks over towards Fjord But
it seems such a romance was merely just another
way to try and toss me to the proverbial wolves
or merrow if it will Theyve now killed my crew
Theyve taken a number of my things damaged my
ship and theyre trying to smear my name One who
has walked alongside you and all of you fine fine
folks for the past ten years Even using the
memory of Vandren against me You hear a few
voices go like  Vandren Vandren
raised this one and he sabotaged his ship Blew it
asunder in the middle of the ocean That was the
last he was seen Hes already killed one of our
own Is this untrue
 Yeah
 Someone goes Shh All eyes are on you
 Make a persuasion check
 The Plank King gives you this very severe
look His eyes narrowed and glancing you up and
down almost piercing you with but a glance He
raises his hand with a grin and goes Oh Whats
necessary for such a thing
 Be my guest Avantika is like What
is
 Shes manacled and being held by two guards
from behind Its autohit
 Do you have a ki point left
 All right Whats the DC on that
 Yeah whatever your DC is for all of your
monk stuff
 Okay Its a wisdom save No Thats a
natural eight plus four  So all these
different hits and pressure points are hit like
under the chin that area Another to the sternum
and another that clocks the temple And Avantika
just Ugh 
 Intimidation checks Oh charisma checks
Yeah persuasion everything else Thats right yeah
 Shes like
 Ugh
 The Plank King steps forward Avantika is
what theyre saying true She goes frustrated
grunt Glances aside Doesnt respond He leans
forward closer Tell me
 Is what theyre saying true Is that book
containing passages where youre looking to take
this island for yourself Her eyes look away She
just looks down at the rest of the dock He leans
in real close pushing his forehead almost to
hers Look me in the eye woman
 She just doesnt meet his gaze Hmm By the
power of The Revelry that surrounds me let this
be a lesson to those who would work against the
words we swore to each other on this land May
your memory be besmirched for the few days its
recalled He reaches forward and grabs Avantika
by the throat and lifts her up and shes fighting
against it He lifts her and looks at her I hope
your sea god whatever it is is very merciful on
the other side  He breaks her neck
with one hand Her body goes limp in his grasp and
he throws it to the docks Dont worry about the
cipher Solon goes Its actually quite
interesting Id like to continue Fine
 And its really well done Im honestly
very taken aback by it Your penmanship is quite
good as well
 Oh certainly He goes and starts taking
it At this point the Plank King goes Take her
up top Shell be the next on the pike As for the
rest of you youve pulled out a conspiracy Ill
give you that Youve also snuck your way into The
Revelry under false pretenses Youve broken our
laws within but a day of being presented with
them in multiple ways Thats a serious offense
So hear my judgment upon these folk You are
hereby banished from Darktow Take the remnants of
the Squalleater as your own Take whatever He
looks over towards the rest of the crew you hired
who are like 
 They have had a terrible few weeks here
Except for Orly whos sitting there smoking a
pipe and his one eye goes
 Take the ship youve thereby damaged Limp
your way beyond the reefs Were going to burn the
colors of that ship Should you ever return to the
outskirts of the Dragshallow we wont hesitate
but sink you to the depths below
 Unshackle them This stands immediately I
hope you have enough supplies in that boat to last
you the rest of the journey
 Good Tell the Archives that the Plank King
sends his regards
 Now fucking go
 Okay You have to dive into the water to do
so
 So you jump into the water Make an
investigation No thisll be a perception check
with disafuckingvantage
 Yeah
 You spend the next five or so minutes
scrounging through silt and muck and barnacles and
gathered bits of kelp and various other underwater
plant life that has rooted itself among the rocks
here Youve scraped your fingers theyre
bleeding from digging through You find a cluster
of these gems that you dropped and you climb up
out of the freezing water and find one of the
nearby ladders and come up Looking at your
quarry it is a bunch of rocks
 Oh you dont see Jester You just see an old
prospector come up
 You guys are ushered to the Squalleater
Your crew is ushered to the Squalleater
 The Mistake is still in repairs and at this
point has been left behind
 The remained of them yes Bouldergut is
heavily manacled and is currently guarded by seven
different guards
 All right As you guys get on the ship with
your crew the ship is damaged the sails are
damaged one of the masts is damaged Its going
to need some repairs for it to be fully
functional But you have to leave now
 You take your positions at the ship pull up
the anchor and make your way limping through the
channel of Dragshallow Reef back out towards the
Swavain Islands the Lucidian Ocean As you slowly
make your way with what little bit of wind you can
pick up to bring you out there some of the sails
are still working so youre not fully damaged
but youre not optimal There are a series of
these what are referred to as the War Posts that
are the clusters of driftwood and these towers
that are set up along the reef and on top of the
various reefs that are shallow or breach the
actual surface that have cannons attached that
have flares set up and beacons that can be lit to
alert Darktow You get a better look this time of
the system they have to defend this island from
the Clovis Concord and anybody else that would
look to make their way via ship to this island
You can see them at the ready keeping a very
close eye on your exit as you slowly walk of shame
yourselves out of the purview of the Plank King
and to a very carefully earned freedom
 Okay
 Make a general persuasion check for me Just
a persuasion check
 Okay you do A number of the crew that you
hired some of them look like theyre a little
scarred from the experience but you managed to
calm them down They seem very thankful that
youve pulled them you brought them into this
mess but you pulled them out of it and theres
something to that Some of them begin to get back
to work begin to repair some of the aspects of
the ship Man
 There are a few places but for the most
part and its only the one mast You still have
enough sails because its a threemast ship You
can still coast the winds but its not going to
be optimal speed Youll have to get back to some
sort of a port to get the rest of the sails
repaired because you dont have replacement sails
The downside of the Fireball The Fireball and
the actually It was a foot tall Wall of
Fire
 It was
 Yeah theres a lot of sail you have
 I know but thats a very intense
 I would say comparatively youre limping on
one full mast of functionality and the rest of
the sails are partially damaged
 Just so you know
 Just so you know this ship travels on an
average pace of around  miles a day Right now
with the damage the sails have sustained youre
close to  Youre less than half speed on the
ship with the damage its sustained at the sails
Its going to take you a while to get anywhere
But you have it
 Theyre beyond Mending
 Mending can do little tears and things
 For the ones that are damaged the sails are
mostly destroyed They caught fire and burned
 Doesnt quite work that way and its
temporary Its more
 To be fair I think that worked in your
favor If tonight has proved anything if the end
of the last campaign has proved anything
Counterspells always a good choice
 You guys have now pushed into the rest of
the seafaring mist It takes you a while to move
beyond the Dragshallow Reef the better part of
the day before you escape the channel at the pace
youre moving The clouds are pretty heavy now
The open sky that you enjoyed on your way to
Darktow has now become not a storm front by any
means but definitely cloudier skies As youre
heading outside you can see Yasha smelling the
air and be like This might be getting close to
storm weather
 She smiles
 Continuing past into that space repairs are
being done best you can with the ship still
limping along You make your way out of the
Dragshallow Reef out into open waters and the
ocean is yours
 Yeah
 Bring out the map
 Its usually right there It got moved for
Honey Heist thats why Oh is it down there Oh
there it is It got hidden It got moved from me
 Damn it Bobby There you go
 You guys have just managed to make your way
out of here
 Well that is the Wildmother She is nature
I guess
 Its a good thing I grew up a stutterer
 Oh I know Max Headroom
 Its funny I didnt realize who played him
until years later and I was like really him
 Oh whats the actor
 He was and he played the part of Jobe in
Lawnmower Man  Anyway
 Its a resource stop It might have some
repairs in your experience Its not a major port
by any means its more of a small
 Yeah its a resupply
 From your experience
 To answer your question Orly goes Yeah
Theres a way to get that working for you Well
all take course and head for that mmmighty
dangerous part of the sea He marks it and they
set it You guys have been making your way around
the Dragshallow northward towards that area
 Okay Is this an ability or
 Oh there we go
 Okay yeah The Wildmother responds
Actually let me see what will be the best answer
to this one give me just a second stage
whisper Talk amongst yourselves
 You get that situated Anybody else doing
anything
 Your answer by the way is
 Bisaft Isle
brings you safest harbor in what you seek
 Theres a warm gentle embrace that comes
with the words an understanding and a familiar
matronly guidance that brings you calm on the
ocean seas that have long brought you anxiety For
the first time in probably a good number of weeks
you get to walk out on that deck take a deep
breath of ocean air and feel really confident
 Mmhmm
 Oh Im quite familiar
 About as close as any direction gets
really Other eye even
 Making it jump around a bit guys Mm Very
well Mmmake sure to point this ship in that direction
 And you
 Oh its still there
 Okay Make an investigation check on that
 No it is not trapped
 The lower was 
 Glancing around you find Theres her
dresser with a number of outfits coats shirts
things that belong to the captain that you guys
get to distribute as you see fit
 Theres a few hats yeah
 Avantikasized hats
Hats hats and teddies

 I will say you do find some scented oils
but thats the extent
 Shes not a perfume keeper
 The altar is still there the altar to
Ukotoa
 Yeah You find a few other maps and things
that refer to a You see it breaking down the
different trade routes and you see other paths
breaking out those that try and avoid the trade
routes to avoid the pirates Those different paths
they might take at different times of the year to
try and head off people that are trying to avoid
the waters that theyre looking in You find maps
that deal with the path to Urukayxl and you see
the handwritten map by Jamedi that was the path
you guys were lead through on Urukayxl to find the
temple You find another map that has circled
heavily the archipelago that youve already sussed
out and you find recent notes on that same map
that refer to the loose area circled where your
ship went down that time ago
 Well youll get near that area If you want
to head that way you can let Orly know to
 You find a lot of those materials You get
the sense that aside from the maps most of the
information that she had she kept in that book
 You find a number of fine cheeses
actually
 Not quite All the good food was kept for
the captain and some of its turning a little but
its cheese Some better treats and some sugared
candies that were kept specifically like a
private stash for the captain you manage to
find
 Yeah
 Its going to take you about a week to get
to the location that youre seeking
 No the islands going to take longer than
that to get to where the last time you recall
your ship going down
 Yeah it would take a shorter time Its
about eight days or so to get there eyeballing it
from here Id say More than that ten days
 Do you have access to Control Water
 Then yeah
 Okay Ill say with the Control Water
 Its in the cleric list yeah
 Between the two of you it allows you a
brief moment where you can actually surge the
water and grant you a speed boost Id say thatll
cut three days off of your travel the two of
you each day spending that slot to push it Its
like a speedboat burst All of a sudden your
giant threemast ship is going 
speedboating across the ocean briefly
 Eventually you make your way to the open
waters in the vicinity of Orly goes with you
each day and looks about and gives you the
onceover and goes Im pretty sure that were
pretty dang close to that place you were asking
about
 Okay Its a thousandfoot range and it has
to be something familiar to you
 Okay Thats ndlevel It lasts for ten
minutes
 Okay and how many spell slots do you have
ndlevel each
 So if youre both trading off its about
three chances per type of use per day How many
days you want to spend looking total
 Yeah
 Its up to you
 Well these guys can summon stuff with
magic if I recall
 Altogether with the eight of them it cuts
the travel time down to five days So youve got time
 Okay so taking your time I would like you
to each to roll a base wisdom check for each pass
as you go through
 Yes d plus your wisdom modifier
 Okay Again
 This is just check Add your wisdom
modifier
 Okay Roll again Your third spell slot of
the first day hitting this space and scanning the load
 Okay and youre utilizing your memory of
passage through here as well as Orlys direction
on this ocean Go ahead and roll an intelligence
check for me
 Okay First day goes through Nothing
catches your attention You pass around and then
once you make it quite past the area based on the
measurements where you think that you recall it
happening The next day you make a curved turn
and begin to head out to see some more land as
you can to widen the perspective of your search
For the second day roll again
 Three in a row yeah Unless you want to use
more spell slots to do more So you can do your
rdlevel to burn as well
  Pardon me Thank you 
Pardon Thank you
 I am at least
 Sure
 Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for
you as well
 Okay You go through the second day and
towards the end you Caduceus sense a brief
moment where something shiprelated catches your
attention and then is gone
 Vague direction
 Yeah youre moving So its like all
right lets go ahead and turn it around
 You turn the ship back in the direction of
where it goes At the very end of the second day
just as dusk is starting to creep in you make
your way back in the area and you sense another hit
 Okay As youre attempting to find the orb
roll a wisdom check
 Okay You lose your concentration on the
Locate Object
 You circle around again Youve closed off a
distance but you havent quite located the
specific area yet Youre trying to guide into a
vicinity I mean its hard to really remember
specifically where when its just open water and
a storm looming especially So you get to a
certain point where youre like Im not sure Im
being able to help but youre starting to get
something Youre not entirely sure The
divination seems to be helping or this aspect of
your Locate spell Evening comes to a close You
ride the night out The clouds are still thick
The next morning you can attempt again if you
like both of you
 Make another intelligence check for me as
well
 Okay Roll again
 This is your second spell slot used
today
 Okay
 Okay Between the  and your  intellect
in guiding the ship around you find yourself now
collecting a secondary blip Once again on the
ship not on the eye
 Youre concentrating on the orb or the
ship
 The ball You find nothing
 So you create a Frumpkin octopus
  Frumpkin makes his way in the
darkness
 Okay How long does it last
 Okay Make a perception check for Frumpkin
 Okay About an hour goes by Nothing Roll
again
 Frumpkin goes beyond your visual range for a
bit You start getting worried and then Frumpkin
returns and is making his way quickly towards the
ship
 foot is the connection
 Technically the distance doesnt matter for
what you can see through his eyes Its a  feet
for it to communicate
 Correct during that time So yeah you
watch through Frumpkins eyes as he makes his way
toward the finally finding the floor of this
ocean Over this second hour of his search he
catches one shape that is emerging like an obelisk
on the bottom of the ocean Upon getting close
enough you can see it looks to be the front of a
wrecked ship itself damaged and caked in
minerals ocean floor plant life barnacles It
appears to be a damaged ship
 Okay Frumpkin does a circle on it before
feeling confident that hes discovered at least
something of interest and then beelines it back
to the Squalleater
 Then Frumpkin is now there at the surface of
the water without really a way getting back into
the ship
 Yeah there you go back in your shoulder
 Over an hour
 Like just barely From the distance where
you are now Itd be just under a thousand if you
were right over but youre not entirely certain
how far The boat isnt set for that currently
 Youve got weight
 The stuff that you found at Urukayxl
 That would be amazing
 You look up and on the side theres the
Plank King and Avantika looking at him Hes like
Where youd find these people

 All right so you guys have another nights
rest As you wake up the next morning it is
raining There appears to be a small storm making
its way in there
 Well once you make it in the ocean youll
find out Noticeably Yasha is energized with the
coming of the storm Seems to be in more energetic
spirits than youre used to seeing her You guys
complete your meal for breakfast You gather your
supplies What are you going to do
 Okay
 All right all of you now have the
capability for the next  hours to breathe
underwater Your lungs feel heavier than they do
while you breathe air Its unique No gills
sprout from the side of your neck per se but the
air itself seems to have a weight to it and
youre like  Its still breathable air
but the process seems to have changed a bit
 Theres no sand to fill them with out in the
ocean unfortunately
 As a note too when the Squalleater came to
port that night Darktow was resupplied with
cannonballs on board For those who are keeping
track which would be
 You The ship currently has a cache of 
cannonballs
 Okay You maneuver the boat slowly also
closer to where Frumpkin saw because when Frumpkin
found it it was at an angle away from you which
is how it was just beyond the range of a thousand
feet Moving over its probably close to  feet
below
 Okay
 Its not going to go that far
 Dancing Lights You cast Light on
 Yasha casts Light on her sword the
Magicians Judge
 To the point where youre intoxicated
 Okay
 This poor little its better over the days
that its been able to spend with you since
Darktow but this ferrets been through quite a
few experiences
  Then he curls up He
hears a loud noise 
 Hmm I cant remember which eye it is
anymore Ill have to go check Mmm
 Why
 You watch as Orlys head retracts into the
shell slightly with this look of
 Marius steps up and goes like Im happy to
look after him Actually been quite a while since
Ive seen a pet
 Who youve dragged all the way from
Nicodranas
 He does look a little more oceanwearied As
prim and proper and put together as Marius was at
Nicodranas hes definitely rocking more of a
Pirates of Penzance thing now
 Of course
 Are those the only options
 Okay Hello oh 
 Right
 Okay Well come Lets get you some cheese
and oh thats my hand youre peeing in okay
 He carries him off All right you gather
your supplies you gather your cannonballs
 As it stands the cannonballs are smooth
solid metal How are you bringing them down with you
 That can be done You do have a few sacks
 Ill allow it yeah
 As you place the dagger against it theres
a brief moment where the dagger seems to shift
energy and you slip it inside of it and at that
point the handle is now solid with the
cannonball so one cannonball has a handle
Another one a sack around it Actually a few of
them you can put sacks around it so
 Yeah shes coming with you
 You splash and break the surface of the
ocean As you all begin to sink slowly beneath the
waves the light begins to get darker and darker
the further down you pass The shades of
greenblue begin to turn to a deep greenbrown
and even that light begins to fade just having
the few points of light that you are bringing
along with yourselves towards the bottom of the ocean
 Nott has not taken a breath yet actually
 You get to a point Nott where your lungs
hurt so much you cannot help but breathe in and
there is a moment of panic as suddenly water
rushes into your lungs and the nightmare youve
had many times kicks in
 It takes a little bit to adjust and anxiety
is still spiked in you but you begin to find
yourself breathing water in and out like thicker
air but still air and its more comfortable
than you expected
 You can
 It doesnt have the same volume you do above
water which means you can cast spells underwater
without issue
 Yes same as you had before It carries
vibration and sound travels far but it loses
enunciation at longer distances but you can hear
voices longer
 Oh this is going to be awful
 Your feet find the bottom of the ocean after
minutes Ten minutes Who knows how much time has
past It seemed longer than you expected until you
eventually you hit the bottom of the ocean
 You see the faint bit of light above where
it marks where the sunlight is hitting the waves
but its an impossible distance from you from this
perspective There are heavy slowly shifting
arms waving tassels of kelp and sea vegetation
slightly drifting and moving with every faint bit
of water that gets maneuvered through with each
wave and push as it goes and you can feel it move
you a few inches and you have to readjust as each
one pushes through
 You realize there shouldnt be waves this
deep necessarily
 You glance over and watch as a large
creature is not that far away from you
 You hear a faint  and glance
over the left You can see a whale making its way
through the water about   feet from you
 Not with a
 He still has the light You can still see
Caduceus and Yasha still have the light on their weapons
 The whale continues on slowly moving not
really acknowledging your presence You can see
two other smaller whales alongside it
 Everyone make an investigation check This
will be perception Underwater perception
 Yep
 Roll for Yasha as well
 Oof All right overall party
 not so great
It takes you a little while about two to three
hours of searching the bottom of the ocean Youre
starting to get a little hungry again from all the
strenuous activity of moving and dragging these
cannonballs with you to keep you weighted down so
you can step across the surface You come past
some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful
visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting
around At one point they swarm past you and you
feel them tickling past your torso before they
skitter past Eventually this lift begins to
descend into a small bowl or at least a point
where the shelf begins to head in a downward
direction at a decline Within the next  or so
minutes of traveling in that direction you see
the outline of a familiar ship
 All right As you all gather in behind Fjord
making your way in the direction of this long
forgotten shipwreck well pick it up there next
week

 Youll find out next week
 That was a good session guys
 That went some interesting places Theres a
number of scenarios that didnt happen
 Theres a lot more on that island
 Yes were not because were law abiding
citizens
 Oh yeah This has gone really interesting
fun places Well thank you guys Im excited to
pick this up next week at the shipwreck Thank you
guys for tuning in Yeah I missed this two
weeks off and suddenly
 You guys had some good solid plans
 Yeah
 Man most of DD is about plans that go
fucking tits up the minute you try and talk about
it Everyone is like Oh they planned so
terribly Every DD game everyone plans
terribly Sometimes plans go great and those are
the ones you remember when you compare it to other
people Oh were great planners Remember that
two times over the past  years we played where
our plans went great Those are the times well
always bring up and judging other peoples plans
Yeah everyone has some good plans every now and
then More often than not plans go pretty shitty
and thats fun Anyway thank you all for coming
and watching along with us after the two week
break Thank you DD Beyond for being our amazing
friends and sponsors Well see you in a week and
remember we love you all
 Is it Thursday yet Good night everybody


 So last we left off the Mighty Nein after
being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent
and straight up pirate adventures across the
Swavain Islands here in the Lucidian ocean on the
ship the Squalleater under the Captain
Avanticas rule you made your way to Darktow
where you attempted to find a way to discredit
her Find a way to not be dragged into her
business in the future It got a little messy but
you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a
head until you are brought into her ship last week
where a battle unfolded in which most of you
managed to skitter away with the contents of this
journal that you had taken from her as well as the
translation for the cipher that was used to write
it Managed to make your way to the Plank King in
time and have him bring his resources to the docks
before any more of you could be further destroyed
Summoning a demon helped as part of the
distraction as well as patiently waiting Some
quick thought process moments You guys did pretty
damn well You managed to just break enough laws
to be put not in favor of the Plank King but
managed to have done a large favor enough to be
let leave and never return Taking the hobbled
ship that you guys had busted with you you made
your way out into the open ocean heading
northeast from Darktow and the Dragshallow Reef
in search of the possible shipwreck that started
Fjords destiny in the direction of Ukotoa After
days of travel and a few location spells cast you
managed to find a blip at the base of the sea
Using your newfound ability to instill the ability
to breathe water within the party around you you
sunk to the bottom holding onto cannonballs and
began to walk the bottom floor in search of the
shipwreck eventually coming upon a valley caldera
that slowly sinks down You noticed aside from
the whale that just skimmed your presence the bow
of a derelict wrecked ship sitting there
surrounded by seaweed in the barelyvisible
creeping daylight making it this deep in the
waters So with your lights aglow and the wreck
before you Mighty Nein what do you want to do
 Well get to that because there was a note
left here on my table that I almost forgot because
the game has started This was written and left
behind by Logic as he passed through earlier It
says Flip over and read as soon as the game
starts
 You Sir Matt are the sexiest being in all
of Neverland Sincerely your boo Logic

 Thats very sweet
 Thank you buddy
 Yeah I know Loading the gun against you
guys for the game tonight Itd be pretty funny
 There you go
 Make a perception check
 With disadvantage because theres no light
here and its a very short range Id say
Because you guys extinguished all your lights when
the
 If you want to
 With disadvantage
 Because you do not have darkvision and its
very dark under here and the distance is very
short You dont have any lights up
 You extinguished them when the whale came
by You can put the lights back on if you want
 Thats true you do have darkvision
 Okay there you go Six
  Okay
 Got you Eyes of the Grave you dont sense
anything gathering your attention as you attempt
to reach out your essence to feel for any undead
presence Nothing But the very cold waters here
beneath still keep you a bit chilled It is very
cold down here Looking around best you can with
the lack of light aside from the swaying bits of
seaweed that are all fluttering up and slowly
swaying reaching up hundreds and hundreds of feet
before the darkness takes them you see the bow of
that wrecked ship Not much else catches your
attention
 Its the Tides Breadth
 Perception check with Frumpkin
 Still a shipwreck There is a shipwreck
ahead of you guys
 As you do step across the surface of the sea
floor there are bits of the silt and sediment
that clouds around your foot with each footfall
 Okay
 Yes So you take and you tip it back The
thing is in order for the liquid to leave the
vessel you have to send air to occupy the space
theres a transition there But youre breathing
water so it will mix water with whatevers in
there
 I mean youre not having to siphon it like
gasoline As soon as you open it it begins to
diffuse into the nearby sea Its very briny
alcohol
 This darkened cloud is filling around Notts
face
 You guys begin to approach stepping
carefully towards the base of this The ship
where its sitting its resting at an odd angle
the front of it the bow slightly angled upward
You can see the side where this large explosion
tore through the hull Already for as long as
its been there which has not been but a year
maybe tops you can see the rust and the
barnacles beginning to gather and claim the
shipwreck to join But thats best you can make
out with the lack of light down here
 Youd probably have to go around a little
bit but yeah You walk around the opposite side
of it Looking in you can see theres some
damage You can see there are holes blown out on
the side that you were facing As you curve
around you can see where theres a large gaping
hole in the side of the cargo hold
 You did hear tale of him passing through
Nicodranas not too long ago
 As you guys have gotten closer to around the
side of the ship where the most extensive damage
was taken you can see where the top of the deck
and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke
out probably during or shortly after the
explosion but before it sank fully The edges of
the cargo hold that are blown open as soon as
you begin to peer in the inside you can see the
interior is blackened as well amongst the other
patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it
as a home and bits of seaweed and general sea
vegetation that has begun to find its way inside
the empty ship
 Make a perception check
 Nein As you begin to swim into the
darkened interior holding the sword in front of
you it doesnt seem to react adjust or give you
any sense that it is able to guide you in any
particular direction
 Okay Frumpkins octopus form makes his way
into the cargo hold of the Tides Breadth
wreckage Go ahead and roll a perception check for
Frumpkin and take a look around
 Unfortunately theres so little light down
here even for the darkvision Theres the basic
outline of the interior hold Frumpkin can notice
the outline of pieces of broken crates and other
elements that may have once been stored within the
ship but very little detail is visible
 Well if you havent yet then youll be
doing it now
 One way to find out
 Okay It emanates and lights up the
immediate vicinity The balls dont give off a lot
of light theyre not torchlight in comparison
They work in conjunction to create a larger space
of light but it does help a little bit With that
benefit looking in the space you can see there
are no bodies There are no signs of any
individuals who were on this ship but you also
know from your experience on the sea that those
who die at sea usually float to the surface
 Yes You do see some metallic materials that
have grown rusted You can see the shattered
crates that I mentioned before A lot of them are
burned and destroyed As Frumpkin drifts past one
of them you look inside There may have been some
metal bars or some sort of a constructiontype
iron material but its mostly melted and fused
together In fact as Frumpkin makes his way
around all the elements of metal that were
immediately in the vicinity it looks like there
was a cannon There were some other bits of all
you can make out is debris at this point but
other things that were metallic in nature that
have since bowed and fused from the heat of the
explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter
before it sank
 Now because you guys dont have air in your
lungs youre not buoyant to the point where
youre not fighting weight It brought you to the
bottom easier so you didnt have to swim your way
underneath but now youre here the cannonball is
unnecessary to weigh you down
 Essentially You arc over and you land on
the deck For a moment as you glance around its
very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a
very different setting Its a strange ghostship
type chill that runs up your back looking around
and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor
on that side and having conversations over that
edge at sea You and Vandren having a deep
conversation there under the main mast
 Okay You swim through the door Its
currently open and the hinges rusted and pulled
off and the tops of the doors broken and akimbo
You make your way into the darkened interior
chamber The door to Vandrens chamber is closed
What do you want to do
 Yeah go for it Roll lets say a
perception to see if you see anything strange or
out of the ordinary
  Doesnt look like there are any traps
affixed to the door
 Theres a bit of a rust resistance but
youre pretty beefy You shove it with your
shoulder and it opens up You can see all the
silt get kicked off and slowly cloud the space
around it as you push the door open
 You step through and look inside You see
the familiar quarters of Vandren though they look tossed
 As you look inside theres the table where
he normally sat and read his books That table is
set over the shelf is pushed over Looks like
most everything in here has been in some way
shape or form tossed You remember there being
all sorts of decorations that he kept in here
metal candle holders Its all missing
 At first glance
 Make a perception check
 Oh buddy
 You just stand in the doorway as opposed to
doing a thorough investigation of the room and
glance around and begin tying memories and
moments and getting lost in that headspace You
do a notverythorough check over the interior
 Okay youre doing a thorough investigation
of the interior Roll an investigation check as
you rummage through the wreckage
 Okay Looking through and moving some things
aside because youre a sturdy tiefling pushing
things out of the way while youre off you glance
underneath the table in the far left corner You
see a reinforced metal box somewhat melted along
one edge just faintly Its left open The lock
mechanism on it appears to have been broken by
brute force Where it was forced open there are
some heavy claw marks along the edges where the
metal itself looks scarred The interior as you
pull it open and look inside is set with a
leather recess on each side top and bottom soft
leather with two halves that are somewhat
spherical like to hold a small apple
 Yeah You cast Locate Object concentrating
on the orb Let me have a quick glance at this
 All right
 Okay so youre not looking for the orb that
Fjord has something similar to it
 Okay You do suddenly acknowledge your
head pulls at the back of your skull and you
glance over your shoulder away from the ship
 Just as everyone else returns and comes in
the chamber
  The tentacles wrap around and
grasp
 Its like a reverse facehugger
 Roughly the direction you know you sense
its probably between seven to eight hundred feet
from your current location
 Okay
 Make an investigation check
 Make a nature check
 Okay
 Okay Looking at it the claw marks are
probably roughly an inch to an inch and a half
apart and theres four of them It looks like an
indentation for a thumb across one side almost
like whoever was grabbing it was pulling it open
this way and as they pulled it open their
fingers scratched across the metal as it bent and
broke open
 As you guys finish doing your onceover of
the chamber you find a false shelf bottom under
one of the bookcases that was toppled over As you
pull inside it looks like it may have been what
this box was inside It has been pulled open and
broken the wood compartment partially shattered
in the front Looking through this room has been
pretty ransacked
 Yeah what remains of the handful of bound
leather tomes in the vicinity have mostly joined
the muck at the bottom of the ocean
 Okay Going through you go through a number
of cabins chambers This isnt an incredibly
massive ship It was mainly used for sailing and
for transport Its strange for you to go back
once again following through Caduceus and looking
and finding your old chambers as well A lot of
the rooms from the explosion have been destroyed
Because of your generally perceptive persona you
can see elements where this explosion happened
There are stains of individuals that may have been
in the proximity but no sign of their bodies
 You begin to piece together the power and
the source of this detonation and you get caught
up slightly thumbing through the memories and
remembering the people and the faces that used to
serve on this ship with you Remembering the room
where Sabian stayed Wondering if Sabian
survived who else may have But he also was the
one jumping from the deck when the explosion hit
Everything has been cleaned out This appears
salvaged Somebody has come through here and taken
from the interior
 I mean there are a number of creatures of
folklore and things that are greedy no matter
where they live
 Make a history check
 I mean there was one other time that you
encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering
and hoarding things that were shiny and happened
to be affiliated with underwater existence
 Where are you exiting
 Okay make a perception check for me
 In your excitement in having this thread of
possibility towards recovering this third and
final orb from what you understand you
immediately turn around and swim and dart outward
towards where the deck is into the open waters
just as your eyes clarify to see three large
figures that are floating about  or so feet
ahead that seems to have encircled the deck In
but a split second you can immediately make out
their outline You can see the sides of the
frilled head You can see the long fishlike
lower torso and you can see the familiar tridents
with chains affixed to the edge
 Lets roll initiative
 It seems that in these darkened waters
light sources can be very easy to see
 It came like this busted up
 Marching order if you dont mind of who
was behind Fjord
 Yasha probably right behind there
 All right Caleb takes the rear
 Beau said she was behind Yasha
 Thats up to you Fine Caduceus inside
there All right then theres Beau And Nott
 Chilling with Caleb All right
 Initiative order please  to  anyone
  to 
 Yasha got  All right
 All right Then  for Beau and Jester All
right  to ten
  for Fjord
 All right ten to five
 All right
 Caduceus
 All righty
 Great Top of the round first up is Yasha
 Everyones speed is halved underwater
 Except yours
 Her movement speed is  right
  feet would get her almost into melee with
this one
 Yeah just outside of it
 All right so rage Then she can use her
action to dash and move again if shes not
attacking with it
 All right she gets into melee with that
figure there You got it That finishes Yashas
go Beau and Jester your turns
 All right Against which one
 Okay go for it Roll for an attack
 Sure
  hits Go ahead and roll damage on that
one
 Slightly Norse
 Nice That one next attack on it has
advantage
 As Yasha says that Jester glances over
puts her hand out This sparkling radiant light
goes through the water leaving this vacuum trail
behind as the bolt slams into the merrow
brightening up around its chest with the impact of
the magical energy Now its form is glittering
with that light making it very easy to spot its
location Do you want to move or stay where you are
 Back up back inside
 You move inside the chamber there Okay
 You got it That ends your turn Beau what
are you doing
 You have  feet You can get right up to
it Ill shift these guys here a little bit to
make a space for it where they were
 Is your speed  then
 Oh got you So it would be  feet because
you round down in DD unless it specially says
otherwise So youd be just out of range
 All right thatll get you the distance you
need there
  Do it
  hits
 Ten points of damage You have advantage on
that attack by the way because of the Guiding Bolt
 You do not have advantage on that one Only
the first one
 Oh got you
  misses unfortunately The first strike
manages to clock it in the face However as you
go to swing backward the water resistance in
itself which actually this is a good point of
order Remember youre underwater Remember this
going forward melee attacks and weapon attacks
have disadvantage

 A melee weapon attack Ranged weapon attacks
automatically miss if theyre beyond the normal
range The attack roll has disadvantage unless the
weapon is a crossbow a net or a weapon thats
thrown like a javelin So technically Nott your
attacks are fine underwater
 Magic attacks are fine but melee weapon
attacks have disadvantage
 Youve already used your bonus action to
 No worries After the resistance of the
water keeps your blow from coming with too much
impact the merrow spins to you As its jaw opens
theres the rows of tiny sharp teeth Its creepy
when its right in front of you These are
similar but different than the ones you fought
before up at the swamp These have longer more
sallow features They seem to be a little bit more
oceanbased and as such theres a variation to
how they look That finishes Jesters and Beaus
turn Fjord youre up
 Go for it
 Both hit
 It gets hit twice in the chest It tries to
loop around now You can see the shapes against
the little bit of light you can see from the
surface above but its still very dark in the
vicinity aside from the globes he has behind
 Oh so you cursed that guy
 You going to stay in the doorway or move
into the chamber
 All right One step into the room
 Okay so youd still be there
 Okay so you probably move that way then
That ends your go That brings us to their turn
 This one right there in the front its
going to make lets see here
 One bite with its claw and one with its bite
against Im going to say you since youre the
only one who actually managed to connect with it
physically As you rush up into its face and slam
it once the other attack misses as it curves
under It goes  Its jaw opens to try
and snap towards your shoulder and neck area
 No they do not because they both have
sentinel We have to remember that
 Yeah if they both have sentinel they cant
bounce attacks We kept forgetting that in the past
 Because the combination becomes super
broken Thats going to be a
  to hit
 All right and then the claw attack Ooh
thats going to be a  to hit You suffer from
the bite attack nine points of piercing damage
 Then the claws deal ten points of slashing
damage
 Its going to attempt to move out of the way
of each of you because it doesnt know any better
It has a swim speed of  feet so its going to
attempt to pull back to get some range You each
technically get an attack of opportunity on it
 Its hoping Disadvantage on each attack
 You cant make reckless you have to do on
your turn I think
 What was the other
  hits
 Reckless attack
 When you make your first
attack on your turn So you have to choose it on
your turn
  still hits Yeah You both can attack
and it does not move It tries to pull away and
 There you go See now it pays off
 It tries to back away hoping that the water
itself will help protect it to pull away Nuhuh
The two ladies are not going to let it flee
Whack One hit from Beau as Yasha through the
water carves with the greatsword Magicians
Judge hitting across the chest You can see this
deep red cloud form around its chest as it tries
to pull away You hold it in place unable to escape
 There you go
 This one thats hexed is going to move down
towards the deck Itll glance through and it sees
Caleb Its going to move in a little closer to
Caleb and as it pulls its harpoon back it throws
it forward towards you Its going to attempt to
harpoon you Caleb That is a  to hit

 You take  points of piercing damage Im
going to need you to make a strength check
 Its contested
 Yeah You get pulled out of the interior
 
 Nope Caleb stands there in the back
looking and all of a sudden  into his
chest The thing pierces in the stomach area there
and then gets pulled out You try to reach for
him but hes already gone and he gets pulled out
in the middle of the open area From there comes
the shallow priests turn
 The shallow priest is going to move down and
its going to move to there Its going to attempt
to harpoon Caleb out of the other ones grasp as
well Its trying to chain pull you away Thats
going to be a  to hit
 The harpoon ricochets off of the Shield and
goes limp The creature pulls on the chain as it
falls back into its grasp Its currently
clutching its staff in the other hand and its
going to pull back for the rest of its movement
there out of the vicinity Thats going to end
their turn Now it comes to Nott
 Oh gotcha Its a wisdom saving throw
 The one that currently has Caleb That is
going to be a  Success
 The harpoon that pulled Caleb in has been
pulled out of the wound and theres a little bit
of blood thats now trailing from the initial
impact Caleb is not currently held or grappled
Its just not in his face
 Not at this moment When it pulled him in
it pulled it out of his body but its right in
front of him
 You cant quite get up to him
unfortunately Because its  feet underwater
Your speed of  is reduced to  and it took
 feet to get far out You could as a bonus
action dash to move up to him but you cant pull
him back because you dont have an action to try
and grab
 Ill say make a strength check
 Yes
 You feel this small push on your shoulder and
you see Nott drift upside down in front of you As
the merrow who pulled you in with this terrible
toothy grimace and starts going  and is
bowling over chuckling Its a weird moment That
finishes Notts go Caleb youre up
 That one is incapacitated
 No hes just held in place
 All righty
 Concentrating both of you guys Wisdom
saving throw Thats a failure on the shallow
priest and the one thats over there rolled an 
So thats incapacitated is fine with the Slow
however the shallow priest is slowed
 Correct If it tries to cast a spell it
takes a full round back before it can even hit
 You just manage to get back inside of the
chamber The doorways still open All right that
finishes your go Caduceus youre up
 Nope
 One has to be cantrip and the other can be
any level
 You have five more of feet in movement
there stepping out of the doorway
 Yeah
 You can move five more feet you might You
have to eyeball it and may take the risk
  Ill say with the angle  hes
just within range
 Nope Thats a fail One in the middle
thats a ten thats a fail Over here thats a
five Thats a fail They all have a minus one on
their charisma
 Not bad for a stlevel spell It doesnt
get a lot of love
 The water around seems to get even darker
for a moment and ice crystals begin to form at the
edge of their bodies as the chill becomes
unnatural and begins sluggishly shift their
movements this cleric spell sending itself into
their form That finishes your turn
 Finishing that up we can do the top of the
round Yashas up first
 Go for it Yasha by the way is no longer
raging She wasnt attacked or didnt Oh no but
she did get an attack of opportunity so she would
be Youre correct
 That hits
 Yeah both hit
 First blow as she swings by carves through
as it goes taut for a second all of its muscle
seizing and then goes limp as its torso begins to
drift away from the lower half of its fish body
and it begins to slowly float off
 Right now you still have the second attack
It depends on the movement you have and I dont
what else you can get in range for
 Did you roll disadvantage on that attack by
the way
 I would say that gets you right about there
Youd be just in range for the one thats incapacitated
 Yeah
 Its just a down it swims down
 Yeah reroll for this one
  hits
  points of slashing damage
 Well this is Yashas turn
 For your Tashas Hideous Laughter I believe
it gets to make a saving throw when it takes
damage is that correct
 That is a natural 
 Thats right yes
 Okay the advantage didnt help it
 Ooh minus four brings it to 
 So it still resists it
 It reduced it to  but  was the DC
 All right
 That finishes that go All righty Yashas
turns done Beau and Jester
 You dont need to you can get there
 Oh I see
 You would have to Step of the Wind to get to
him
 Okay go ahead and attempt that
 Yeah no that hits

  points of damage to the shallow priest
you got it
 With that you move forward swimming
through the water and then Step of the Wind use
another ki point to get up there fists at the
ready
  hits
 Nine points of damage on that one
 Well that first one should have been just a
regular roll Did you roll with advantage
 Just roll once for the first attack for me
again real fast
 There you go For the second attack its
disadvantage
  still hits
 There you go nine and nine You swim
forward rocketing forward Aquamanstyle and
then two big hits to its face The shallow priest
takes the impact but its body reacts slowly The
spell thats surrounding it is forcing it to move
and shift at half the pace it normally would
 Like rack focuses from Beaus middle finger
to Jesters middle finger Perfect all right
That finishes Beaus go Fjord youre up
 Oh no you can because you dont have to
worry about it
 Correct
 That hits
  to hit
 That misses unfortunately As the first one
carves through the bloody cloud thats forming
from the wounds its sustaining gets thicker and
bigger Its looking pretty hurt
 That finishes your turn
 Now its their turn All right The shallow
priest who is currently slowed is going to use
its action to do its multiattack so thats two
attacks on you with its bite and claw Its not
going to use any of its spells
 No thats right It doesnt get multiattack
when its slowed
 Then its going to harpoon you Its not
going to bother with the claw and the bite Its
going to pull back with its one harpoon and try
and thrust it into your chest
 Yes
 Correct Thats two off of it that brings
it from  to  Whats your armor class
 The Bane prevents it from hitting you As it
goes and thrusts the harpoon forward it
telegraphs it just enough that as it leaves you
 It nicks the very edge of your skin
ever so slightly and thats it
 Its going to attempt to move away
 Go for it Roll for an attack
 Yep
 Correct It would have a swim speed of 
underwater so it can only go  It manages to
pull out of the range up there and at the end of
its turn it gets to
 Both of them make a save because theyre
both well that one no That one missed the
Slow That is a  plus three 
 Minus four ten Yeah its still slowed
 Its starting to turn around too seeing
how things shifted here It saw the light and you
can see what little bit of his expression
underwater at this point They followed this light
to inspect it thought they had an ambush on a
creature and suddenly this party emerged Now
well that ones in a really rough spot This one
is looking like its about to turn and try and flee
Thats going to end the shallow priests turn and
the other ones turn I havent done that one yet
right That one is going to attempt to use its
harpoon against you Fjord
 Since you ran up and carved at it Or yeah
its going to try that Thats a natural 
 Its just not a critical hit
 Your ability youre talking about
 It would still be a critical hit for a
natural  but it would then be a total of it
would be a  still
 You use Channel Divinity once to cancel the
critical on that As the harpoon comes towards
you theres this slight dull green barrier that
seems to slow the penetration of the immediate
lightningfast pace of this harpoon It manages to
carve into the front of your armor and pierce
through ever so slightly Its not a critical hit
unfortunately
 Thats  points of piercing damage to you
After it carves through and wounds you it pushes
through the other way and you manage to roll off
It wouldve been far worse damage if Caduceus
hadnt helped you in that moment Its going to
attempt to move away Yasha gets attack of opportunity
 Right because it is now reckless
 Thatll hit
 No because you were pushing him You
werent moving in that area so youre not quite
in melee with him
  points of damage It turns around and
darts and Yasha just  one swipe with her
sword Shes finishing them off left and right
 Ashley come back
 That finishes the merrows turn It did not
go well for them in that brief instance Nott
youre up
 Yeah Your crossbow actually
 Theyre probably about  or so feet from
you
 Actually crossbow does not get hit with
that problem because theyre piercing However
whats your inside range Its  feet
 Then yeah as long as youre inside range
then youre fine You swim up there towards it as
youre kicking your feet and cocking the bolt back
into it and go to aim just within range You see
it as its turning around to attempt to swim away
at full speed
 That hits
  points of piercing damage to the shallow
priest You see another plume of dark ichor
pouring out the side of its wound as the bolt is
now about three or four inches jutting out of the
side of its torso It glances sidelong at you and
seems to inspire it to try and move faster That
finishes your turn Nott
 Not so much on that one unfortunately
 Finishing that go Caleb your turn
  damage All right how do you want to do
this
 Okay It gets some distance Caleb feeling
comfortable lets the missiles arc past and up and
over as they swirl and gather They all come in at
once and this darkened shape suddenly theres a
flash of arcane energy and this strange little
bubble explosion where it was The impact happens
and its arms separate from the impact They hit in
the torso blew it apart from the inside Theres
a little cloud of darkness left behind as it
begins to slowly disseminate among the rest of the
sea water around
 Here in the shadowed darkness
 On the two regular merrow that you
came across you find that they have their
harpoon There are definitely teeth upon their
bodies and claws as part of their physical form
Theyre not carrying much on them per se beyond
the equipment they have and a handful of collected
shiny things A few copper A key that was
scrounged up thats old and very rusted Looks
like maybe a handful of
 All right you have a rusted key
 The shallow priest since it was destroyed a
ways off some of its accoutrements were left to
scatter and float below You do manage to find on
what pieces you do scrounge up a heavy necklace
made of these larger pearls probably worth a
little bit of gold on the side Thats about it
 Okay
 All right write that down Inspecting where
the hands meet with the box no These are a
different size
 Slightly larger At least it seems
 All right so you have a
 You see these two dark octopus eyes and then
this little unshaven grin poking through underneath
 Id say you have a few more minutes on it
still because you didnt cast any other
concentration spells and you didnt take any
damage so youre fine
 You dont know
 Okay if you want to
 Well consider that as you guys are
traveling Youre helming this journey from that
direction Make a perception check for me
please
  thats great As you guys step off of
the edge of your ships wreckage and all slowly
sink down to find the floor of the ocean once more
and the subtle grade that continues downward As
you being to step following Jester moving
forward you see another shape begin to approach
Jester you see it first and glance over Its
another ship
 No another ship sunken here You continue
on for another  or  or so feet and you see
the shape off to the right of another shipwreck
 The spell fades but you still know the
general direction of where it was coming from Up
to you if you want to cast it again or continue on
based on the memory
 Make a perception check
 You can certainly try Youre moving
halfspeed because of the water and youre moving
at half speed beyond that moving stealthily So
its a very slow journey but you can do it
 Okay Are you guys moving stealthily or
not
 Everyone make a stealth check and make a
stealth check for Yasha as well You guys are
moving at quarter speed essentially to move
underwater
 The average is slightly in your favor
Youre on the edge there Continuing forward it
evens out a bit this gradual calderatype valley
that rests here before you The more you begin to
watch now that youre keeping an eye for it
theres a number of areas where wreckage can be
seen some of it very old The third ship that you
pass by heading in the direction that you recall
has been down here for decades
 Make a general wisdom check
 Yeah since shes attempting to get in tune
with the energy of the atmosphere
 You concentrate for a moment and the water
gets slightly warmer
 You decide to maybe not walk directly behind
Jester
 With the little bit of travel youre doing
theyre sparse but there are a number of ships in
this large area that seem to have sunken at
different times throughout the years
 No source of light no Jester however
whos been at the front keeping a close eye a
little ways in as youre peering out and clocking
in each of these shipwrecks as they come across
you see this little faint blip of light
 You see it once or twice again Its a
little momentary shine
 At this point of travel its about  
feet ahead of you
 The general direction
 All right If I could get a marching order
please
 Whos together and what
 What a nice book end You all begin to
slowly move forward keeping your eyes peeled for
any sort of movement with no light It is
extremely dark here with that faint little bit of
shimmering dull green from above
 There you go As you guys continue to move
in that direction some of you begin to see this
light as well Caduceus first then you Caleb
and Beau You see it looks like imagine if beams
of sunlight managed to roll across a piece of
polished metal a little shining shifting sight
 Are you guys staying put or are you
continuing to move forward slowly
 You all sit tight for a second halting your
position You watch as the octopus makes its way
into the shadow ahead Caleb youre focusing and
it takes a while but Frumpkin eventually
following this tiny shifting bead of golden light
into view You begin to see towards the center of
where this large valley is There is a large
cluster of long dead palewhite coral that
surrounds a rocky stone shelf
 Make a perception check for Frumpkin
 Okay You see this coral space around Its
massive its maybe   feet across and its
this dead chunk of coral reef in this vicinity
that amassed around this central stone that rises
up Theres a small crevasse on the side of it
that goes down about  or so feet and you can see
fish weaving through
 Yeah but its occasional
 Yeah and maybe every now and then reorient
the direction that Frumpkin was traveling As you
come to see this space does Frumpkin continue to
get closer
 Okay Frumpkin moves around and it takes a
while because Frumpkin isnt very good at
perceiving right now
 You guys are getting a little impatient
here hearing
 Yeah
 If you want to
 You all continue to move forward
 Frumpkin is going around and checking and
finds that towards the front of this coral reef
area where this rock shelf is there appears to be
an open cavern entrance right underneath this
shelf As Frumpkin ducks down and looks you can
see another one of the shine theres a few of them
 Frumpkin quickly retracts and finds his way
to the rest of you
 Yep
 As youre moving through this area there
are clumps of seaweed that rise up hundreds of
feet out of view The base of it is pretty thick
and you could try and move through that Thats
what you are using to stealth as you come through
darting from section to section of this heavy
underwater vegetation
 Sure
 Thats going to itch like a motherfucker in
the morning
 You slowly farm sections of seaweed and
begin to shift your way forward using it as a
screen The shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along
in the direction of this coral cluster
 There you go
 Whos at the front of this journey
Maintaining a similar position
 Okay Perception check and one other person
if they wish to
 Both of you guys roll perception
 Okay
 As you both come up to the edge of where the
sandbank here seems to slightly descend in a
series of soft steps before that small ravine
carves down and that large chunk of rock stands
there you can see the cavern You see once again
that shifting Its like a wave of light passes
over You can see its coins A bunch of light
passes over coins that are scattered amongst the
floor of the entrance of this tunnel
 Not from this distance
 You saw at the entrance a handful of coins
that caught the light yeah
 Youre maybe about since you stopped at
that edge before it begins to descend over youre
about  or so feet from this
 Yeah Ahead and facing towards you guys with
a large shelf that protrudes over it that puts it
mostly in shadow and the corals built all around
that If you wanted to try and move around it you
could but its about  or so feet across
 You guys swim across towards the top All
right You paddle up as a group up
 Oh around
 You guys move slowly around still moving
stealthily to the edges Then you move up and
over What are you doing
 Okay
 You get up and slowly descend towards where
the coral is Your feet find the edges Some of it
is brittle and as your foot touches it snaps and
parts of it crumble at the very edges but nothing
that you feel will alert your presence
necessarily
 As you move up to the edge of the shelf and
you glance over the edge you see the shadow
entrance of the cavern before you Once again that
shimmer finds its way across a dozen or more coins
that are visible partially embedded in the muck
and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance
 Its bits of coral When you step out
towards that shelf the coral recedes and now its
a protruding large slab of stone
 Make a perception check
 It looks to be stone
 Okay So you use Channel Divinity once and
you send your duplicate to swim down
 Okay You watch as the illusory Jester goes
and performs a great stock video of excited lucky
person performing the reaction silently
 Have you ever
 Dont you hate it when
  seconds pass of Jester doing the song and
dance down there No reaction
 Okay Fjord dives off the side and swims
down towards the entrance to this cavern As you
approach you can see the coins plainly in front of
you Do you land at the entrance
 Okay Your feet find soft footfall on the
sediment that has gathered there knocking up a
little bit of it for a minute before it all
eventually settles once more Looking inside make
a perception check
 Okay
 You glance inside theres no source of the
light that you keep seeing flashing by You look
down and theres no glittering anymore Theres no
traveling light beam but the coins are there in
front of you Looking up into the cavern it
continues in and seems to descend and open up into
a chamber just where your darkvision ends
 The inside is filled with seaweed as well
It seems to be running up the walls of the
interior as well as a section of it sitting in
the center of the main chamber Its a different
color than the seaweed that youve been using to
get here
 With a slight displacement and popping sound
of the water making room for the falchion as it
emerges it hums slightly in your grasp being
this deep in the ocean
 No but it is casting it and it is very
present There is a faint hint of eagerness
brimming from within you
 Okay so you stay up above All of you make
your way towards the entrance to this cavern
 All right that will be Caleb at the back
Jester and Fjord towards the front everyone else
staying in the center
 Thats right so you will be up with Jester
As you guys slowly begin to make your way into the tunnel
 As you release Nott into the water you guys
begin to take your first steps into the interior
of the cavern Were going to take a break
 Well be back here in a minute to see what
this strange chamber seems to hold

QuickAscension QuickAscension congratulations
well get this out to you ASAP
 QuickAscen no
 That will break me As we left off you all
were beginning to make your way into this series
of theres this whole strange entrance to this
cavern
 As you step in the inside it descends a
bit like makeshift natural paths like stairs or
grades that curve around and drop into the central
chamber where you see it goes in two different
directions to the right and left In the middle
theres a large cluster of this purplishmaroon
seaweed The outside of the leaves have a
tealish blue color It wraps up against the walls
as well As you swim through and move the still
water shifts with your movement you can see some
of it sway and move with your movement
 Looking down make an investigation check
 Apparently Well if there was a week to use
it
 You sift your hand through underneath and
feel You find an errant copper piece left there
that comes up into your fingers The rest of it
appears to be general sand and soft silt that
clouds a bit around your fingers as you pull your
hand up from mucking around in it It settles
fairly quickly
 Right about now she vanishes
 Yes
 Its certainly possible
 Okay Nothing ahead of you seems to give a
magical aura behind you ever so faintly
 Its coming from the mouth of the cave
towards the top
 Nothing in the room and you do know
glancing at that magical aura coming from the
entranceway it is illusory in nature
 Correct
 Nope
 Old Buttonbeards legend lives on As
Buttonbeard trounces around the central chamber
no reaction
 You express your interests to the kelp
Well seaweed technically Kelp is a little more
shallowbased yeah
 Youre all still standing in the entranceway
as you come down into this central chamber Its
about   feet from side to side and then it
branches off to the right and left ahead of you
 There is that central cluster of seaweed
that is coming up and going against the ceiling
and you can see on the walls its still riding
along the edges
 You move towards the fork The chamber
itself is ovallike but in the center of the
chamber is where theres a mass of the seaweed so
youd have to curve around it to get to either exit
 There are some wayward stones that you could
probably
 No all the seaweed in this chamber is a
different color than what youve seen when you
came in Everything else had a greenishblue tint
to it this has a deep maroonpurple with a blue
outline across the exterior of each little thread
of leaf
 Yeah they were mangoesque
 It hits it moves with the impact with the
faint bit that gets hit Theres no reaction
 Make a perception check
 Oh just you okay
 No bubbles Theres no aeration of the
interior here
 Glancing up yeah you can see where the
seaweed gathers and bunches up towards meeting it
from the walls in the center of the chamber Its
maybe  feet above you Its not terribly tall
 You can see the two sides yeah
 It looks like its a cavern
 Okay It goes a few inches into the soft
floor of the chamber before it hits stone
 Okay You take your first step and you watch
something drift across the entrance from wall to
wall Some faint glowing figure and is gone
 Not magic sense no
 Okay Give me the specifications on that
one
 Okay got you How long does it last
 Okay Well say for the purposes of this
this is a reaction to seeing this figure pass by
You definitely get an undead sense from whatever
this figure is and then it merges with the wall
and is gone It appeared to be loosely humanoid in
the brief glimpse you saw
 Okay In the center of the kelp forest that
sits in the center of the chamber a source of
light begins to emanate like a lantern covered in
soft diffusing material The beams protrude and
lighten up the chamber like a lantern As it goes
through you have a better view of the interior
You notice that the kelp forest is cluttered with
strips of cloth bones two or three merrow
corpses that have long decomposed and look tangled
and wrapped and are held towards the ceiling
There are a handful of what might have been human
remains tangled in that same seaweed
 The light vanishes once more and darkness
comes to the chamber
 Do you guys continue to the right chamber
 Understood Fjord You just have this gentle
chill on the back of your head like something
frozen just caressed the back of your skull and is
gone
 You continue forward through this tunnel
around the seaweed cluster in the center Moving
through in the same order that you situated there
Theres just enough room maybe ten feet across
to stay comfortably youd want to singlefile it
As you walk through the edges of the seaweed
begin to drift forward seemingly drawn in by the
warmth of your bodies
 Its pulling in Theres the central section
and the wall As you begin to move through it
begins to slowly pull in to close in towards you
 Moving quickly through its not moving
rapidly As soon as you see this you begin to
dart through The only person who would be in
danger is the very end Caleb since youre at the
back I need you to make a dexterity saving throw
for me Because as all of you start darting
through and making your way theyre drifting and
tangling in closer together
 Okay As you move forward you feel a bit of
it touch your shoulder and then it wraps around
and pulls you against the wall You guys hear this
 behind Theres a shift of water You
watch Caleb get yanked towards the right side of
the chamber Its currently  The seaweed
begins to snake its way around Caleb you take
five points of poison damage and are grappled
 Sure Ill say two attacks with disadvantage
because youre having to aim them to try to keep
around him
 Okay the light fills the space
 Okay yeah Both hit go ahead and roll
damage
 Okay each side Both blasts of Eldritch
Blast impact the sides of the cavern wall with a
dull  The clusters of seaweed that
currently wrap around Caleb are torn to the point
where you have enough strength to pull yourself
free breaking the grapple You shrug them off of
you As youre touching with your fingers your
fingers spike with pain No additional poison
damage necessarily but you know staying would
continue to do so
 You are not poisoned You just took poison
damage You manage to pull it away and catch up
with the rest of the crew You guys are heading
towards the right chamber which begins to rise up
a bit before leveling off about  feet above and
about  feet ahead of you The walls are still
covered in this seaweed in chunks About every
five or so feet you see another cluster and
theyre a bit scattered around the interior A
large portion of this whole chamber network seems
to be housing this same type of plant
 Make a perception check
 Okay so youre readying the spell
 Yeah so youre fine
 Okay Jester you feel this like a burst
of brain freeze for a second like something cold
tickles the inside of your head And its gone
 Caduceus you see something shadowy shift
long down the hall up and above that barely catches
your attention before its gone
 You dont Its not the same as before
 From what you saw before it was giving a
faint pale glow and had a ghostly presence to it
This is just a movement in dark shadow
 Yeah she has an ability
 Yeah so Yasha holds onto that then
 All right So continuing on
 All right Go ahead and make a perception
check to see if you notice anything strange about
the interior
 Okay Looking about the area it looks like
a natural cavern You dont see much that would
catch any some sort of dissembled or trap
mechanism with a trigger
 Okay The globules appear like lights coming
on segmented down a long hallway As the final one
glows right behind it you see the figure of a
man looking at you white and pale who then steps
back into the wall and vanishes
 No Because youre the closest up there
since youre helming it in with darkvision
Darkvision wouldnt matter so much in this
instance But the figure you saw looked to be male
wearing loose fitting clothing sunken eyes with
no actual eyes inside the sockets pale with a
faint ghostly glow about their visage A line of
rope wrapped around one arm Multiple loops It
just stared at you before stepping back into the
wall and vanishing
 No expression Just blank and cold Absent
of any real emotion before it dissipated
 Continuing down this path you climb or swim
up the brief foot incline to get to the next
tunnel path where the orbs were spread out to
continue You move through and the elements of
seaweed that were still in there are shifting from
the water displacement ever so slightly As you
move through same order you guys are going
through
 All right That being the case as you push
through I need Caleb once again to make a
dexterity saving throw
 Okay Go for it Ill let you do that
 All right You cast Expeditious Retreat You
manage to dart forward and out of the grasping
hands of the seaweed through the use of your
spell You catch up now darting forward through
everybody next to Jester and Fjord
 Okay There We are moving forward in that
 Okay Following the tunnel down for another
 to  or so feet it curves around to the left
Do you continue and curve around the edge
 You come around the corner and look You
guys are at the front I need Jester and Fjord to
make since you have the globes you can move the
globes ahead if you want to
 So you do not have disadvantage on your
perception checks
 Well youre further back Well get to you
Because theyre the ones at the front they get to
do this first
 But youre safer in the middle What did you
get
 As you turn around the corner and look the
path continues for another  or so feet in this
tunnel before it descends into a much larger
chamber The seaweed gets thicker towards the
mouth of this chamber From the little bit of
glowing orbs that begin to extend over that edge
that goes into it what little bit of light hits
bits of gold coins scattered all throughout the
floor of that next chamber
 Yes they are but that center cluster
seemed to have quite a few that were in there
These in the walls only have a few scattered
pieces of parts No full bodies here in the hallway
 Beau as youre coming around that corner
and people are looking off to the side you glance
over your shoulder and see for a split second an
older man with a curled and scraggly beard that
goes down to about midchest The eyes are
missing You see vacant dark sockets The jaw is
slackjawed and open as it looks towards you I
need you to make a charisma saving throw please
 It leans in towards you and not yet It
leans in towards you and you feel this cold
sensation over your whole body Your muscles lock
in place and your consciousness goes dark Out of
the corner of your eye you see some sort of
ghostly movement You look over and see Beau rest
into a standing position on her back foot
 Whats the DC on that
 Eyes are open yeah
 Whatever your spell DC is
  No fails by one Its a  plus one

 Being a specialist in undead and already
preparing for the presence here you glance out of
the corner of your eye just in time to see the
essence of this spiritual form drift into Beaus
body As you watch that moment of consciousness
fade from her face as the presence of Beau goes
cold and whatever was in this tunnel begins to
come to the forefront you take your staff and
slam it into the ground This wave of light energy
emerges It impacts all of you and the water gets
suddenly warm around you As it blows past Beau
you see strands of hair get blown back and with
that that same ghostly old man body jettisons out
the back of her and drags down the hallway into
darkness and disappears
 You have an essence after what just happened
that something weird happened and you lost yourself
 As you guys are having this conversation
you glance back in the tunnel where you came from
where Caduceus had jettisoned that spirit back
and at the very edge of the light you can see
about  or so of these ghostly figures standing
there unmoving
 All right Pushing towards and following the
orbs gliding forward the mouth of this
entranceway before it opens up is where it looks
like two larger clusters on each side of this
seaweed is through You are what
 They autofail saving throws Theyre
seaweed

 Roll damage Well see if its enough to
clear the way for a moment You as well Caduceus
 Okay The side on Caduceus edge of the
wall you watch this blast of radiant energy
emanate from the side of the wall and blow out the
center part Some of the seaweed get released and
begins to scatter and float towards the top Your
side blasts but it doesnt quite tear all the way
through You guys begin darting forward on the
right side Caleb youre the first one there
 No Youre still Expeditious Retreat
 All right You dart inside the chamber ahead
of everybody else Youre now in the center of
this open chamber as you stop with the globes
around you to take in the atmosphere The rest of
you are now having to catch up Yasha needs to
make a dexterity saving throw as well
 She gets advantage because she can see it
because of her Danger Sense
 She just actually no she shoulder checks
the seaweed and does not give a shit
 You guys all begin to push forward This
chamber is larger than what you came in through
Its about  to foot diameter continues in
for about  or so feet and the height goes to
about  to  feet All the walls here are
covered in this seaweed Make a perception check
two of you who are helming the view on this
 Thats true Yeah you make one first
 Okay Glancing around you can see areas
where the seaweed is slowly shifting from the
movement of Calebs Expeditious Retreat What was
once still shifts and you can see elements of the
stone wall behind it Your eyes barely make out a
handful of small carvings in the wall Small runic
letters that are not in line but at angle
sporadically carved at places but where the
seaweed moves over and blocks it
 Yeah Id say youre pushing the edge on
this one
 Id say as you step into this chamber are
you heading to the center of it
 As youre standing at the mouth of this
just past the edge you do not detect anything
particularly magical Then as you take your first
step into the chamber you see this You almost
run into it In the middle of this chamber there
is a small twofoot pedestal and a disc a stone
disc about that wide and about two feet from edge
to edge that is resting on it but at an angle It
looks old It looks weathered and there appears to
be a spiral of runes two sets of them that curve
inward around each other before merging in the
center with one singular sigil where they meet
 They are arcane glyphs If youd like to
make an arcana check if you want to take a moment
to study
 These runes this whole incantation this
enchantment or whatever that sits in this is old
preCalamity Age of Arcanalevel magic It is
dormant currently It looks like there is
something that is required to infuse this object
with power or to get it to use whatever its
enchantment is The more you look over it you
realize the powers beyond anything youve cast
The nature of it seems to be conjuration and it
seems to have a lot of the base runes that youve
used to manipulate fire youve used to manipulate
earth Its elemental in nature You continue to
look over it and get the sense that this is
triggered by some sort of theres a physical
material that needs to be brought to this table or
brought as part of this ritual and in doing so
would conjure some sort of powerful elemental
force
 No you did not
 You do feel this faint cold brushing
sensation at the back of your skull
 Okay You cast Locate Object focusing on
 You step forward and can see in the far
back side of the chamber As you guys get a look
around clustered in with the base of the walls
where the seaweed is thick you begin to see as
the light around the chamber comes to touch it
and you see it first there are piles of salvaged
various levels of grime that have gathered on
them but the shine still shows through in places
You can see tools that were haphazardly pulled and
gathered and jammed into pockets in the walls
Its like a nightmarish Ariels grotto almost
You immediately realize that this is all things
that have been salvaged and pulled from all the
ships that have sunk and brought in The floor
youve been stepping on thats been somewhat soft
to the occasional crunch you glance down and
realize is just bones Just hundreds of human and
humanoid bones that have all been gently dusted
with the general sand and silt of the interior of
this chamber
 There is a throne a chair of some kind that
sits on the opposite side of the room Thats at a
slight angle resting against the stone and you
immediately know thats precisely where the object
you seek resides somewhere around or with that
 You guys are standing towards the entrance
like the stairs and the decline that leads inside
Calebs the only one thats actually in the center
of the chamber by this table this thing that
youve been studying
 You glance over your shoulder
 About  feet behind you

 Not moving Just looking at you
 As youre getting closer because the arcana
is not an immediate thing its a slow process of
study Theres a heavy elemental conjuring that
this is capable of doing Its very old primal
magic Looking at the stone the stains and the
interior of these ruins there is distinctly a
dark brown tint to elements of this table
 As you scrape some of it with your
fingernail it flakes off It has a consistency
youre familiar with that of a coagulated blood
 Caduceus as youre looking over towards the
throne you look up and about ten feet above the
throne standing up in the seaweed holding onto
the clusters of it you see a female humanoid form
mostly in shadow hair down over the front of the
face one yellow eye peeking through on this side
and one halfopen yellow eye glancing through up
against the wall
 You watch as she scrambles across the side
of the wall behind the seaweed and is gone
 Lets roll initiative

 This is the chamber youre in right now
This is the entrance
 Yeah you did
 So Caleb you are up against here The rest
of you are just coming down the entrance this way
Tell me whereabouts you were placed around the
base
 Thats true Ill put you and Caduceus kind
of up towards the top there You guys are back here
 Yeah so youll be up here with the rest of
them The shape you saw up in this direction
before it vanished
 Dashilla rolled really good initiative So
whos up first  to 
 All right  to 
 Fjord at a   to ten
 Nott Ten to five
 Caleb
 All righty
 No Id say it took you two or three minutes
to study so Expeditious is still on the table
 Beginning of this round The only person
thats seen this entity is Caduceus
 No They seem to have shifted into this
thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around
all the walls of this chamber Beau youre up
first
 You can use your action to try and perceive
if you want to
 Okay so you use the search action Roll a
perception check
 Eight Unfortunately no You look around
the vicinity and glancing up around and you see
movement from the water thats being disturbed
but no sight of any particular entity
 Okay Bonus action to Patient Defense
 Okay That finishes Beaus turn Caduceus
and Jester you guys can decide which of you goes first
 Is Bless concentration
 All right so you guys get to add a d to
your attack rolls and saving throws
 Right here
 Okay so you go against the wall
 Theres seaweed there
 All the walls are coated in this
 Down this way
 Okay Ill put you there
 Okay That finishes your turn Caduceus
That finishes your turn Jester Okay Jester
youre casting Spiritual Guardians
 There alongside him
 Well where do you want to go If you want
to move
 Here Yeah well make it work There
sure
 Now all these little glowing pink seahorses
now surround you foot right
 Got it okay You have that up You are also
now concentrating on Spiritual Guardians That
finishes Jesters turn there
 That brings us to what did you guys both
roll initiative on
 Okay so concurrent with your turn lair
action
 At this point
 Youre in the lair of Dashilla For this
lair action its going to use Lament of the Dead
As you all stand here rising out of the ground
dozens of spirits begin to drift up of various
drowned sailors and scavengers out of the ground
and up toward the ceiling I need everybody inside
to make a wisdom saving throw please
 Fjord youre fine Yasha is frightened of
Dashilla until the end of the round Caleb
 You succeed You manage to resist the fear
effect
 Oh Nott
 Thats right because youre drunk

 Youre like come at me spirits
 Nott becomes Nott the Brave when shes
drunk
 So unaffected Spirits whatever
 Youve been braving the ocean for half a
day
 You manage to resist it
 As the spirits rise this haunting wailing
sound reverberates in the chamber Both Caleb and
Yasha their eyes go wide and their breathing
begins to increase You guys are frightened of
Dashilla to the end of the turn Now it comes to
Dashillas turn
 Suddenly tearing through the seaweed on the
upper wall you see this figure emerge now This
pale aquagreen skin thats bulbous and strangely
proportioned These long clawed hands As the
hair pulls back you can see where would be a
humanoid face instead are these protracted almost
anglerfishtype teeth that come out of the front
with no nose and the yellow eyes gleaming from
underneath Shes going to look straight down at
you Caleb
 I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for
me please
 Natural one As she looks shes still up in
the air swimming looking at you Mouth opens
and you feel the deepest most horrifying fear
well up inside you Your heart stops and you drop
to zero hit points
 You guys watch Caleb go  and start
drifting there unconscious
 Dashilla now hovering in the space is
going to move over She moves over to the side of
the wall here still visible now jumping and
using and holding onto the seaweed like its a
tether All right
 The periapt That ends her turn Fjord
youre up
 Shes visible Shes up on the wall on this
side
 Remember you guys are still underwater
Aside from Fjord youre all half speed
 Yeah
 The sword does give a faint bit of light
 Right there
 She is hexed You have already used your
 As shes holding up there looking down at
you the murkiness of the nearby waters in the
movement begins to form around her and almost try
and claw at her throat like the shadows
themselves are trying to pull at her clavicle
 Roll two attacks
 Yeah it is
 Both hit You dont even need the ds on
that Roll damage on the critical first
 So two but roll the d which is also
doubled
 So  so thats  plus your
 Thats  points of damage on that one And
damage for the second one
 Well look at that  points of damage on a
cantrip and a Hex Thats how warlocks are done
So as shes up there as the Hex constrains around
her both Eldritch Blasts hit From both blasts
theres these dark scar marks on the upper torso
and one off the shoulder where they impact The
head curls up and  back in your
direction The eyes seem to bulge angrily toward you
 Does that end your turn
 Okay At the end of your turn shes going
to use one of her legendary actions to use Forced
Vision At some point during this adventure as
she was trailing you throughout the cavern and
watching from a distance she ensorceled a number
of your members of the party you being one of them
 She was hiding through all the seaweed and
no one was rolling high enough perception to see
her You saw her move once because she didnt roll
high enough stealth on that one
 Correct You are not immediately in melee
with anybody but shes going to force you to
move You glance All of a sudden you see her out
of the corner of your eye Shes not there
anymore Shes off there You rush in her
direction after her compelled to move over this
side right up against the wall between the wall
and Beau You get there and shes gone You look
back and she never left You shake your head for
a second Thats one legendary action done Next
turn is Nott
 Okay You move over there So bonus action
hide
  hits
 Sorry thats right Yeah
 You dont know Youll find out
 All right So you dart from behind and
fire
 That indeed hits And she didnt roll very
well for perception so you do get sneak attack on this
 
 So darting from the side and letting the
bubbles go by She is within  feet of you so
you do not have the disadvantage It catches her
in the chest and her hands go forward and she
leans out of the seaweed for a second to pull it
out and let it fall as it slowly begins to drift
down sinking into the chamber before reaching
back up into the seaweed and holding on to it
 No She is immune to the effect of the
seaweed
 So is that your turn
 All righty Finishing Notts go Yashas up
Yasha is frightened
 She can do that
 Nah I think thats a thing that berserkers
got
 Ill double check
 Yeah thats mindless rage Its sixth level
path of the berserker Its a little Grog bleeding
in there
 All good
 Caleb is over there
 Jesters right here Shes technically up on
the stair right there
 Ill say for the purposes of ease there
Jester is up on that stair there
 Nope Up on top of this platform or off to
the side
 Theres a little raised section in the
center there
 No
 Caleb did
 Yes it does
 So youre back to consciousness Youre at
seven hit points
 Correct
 No Mage Armor is not concentration
 Correct Youre still frightened until the
end of the turn
 Yeah
 Correct
 Okay so she goes into a rage
 All right that ends Yashas go At the end
of Yashas turn its going to use another
legendary action to use Forced Vision on you
Fjord I need you to go ahead and make a melee
attack against Beau as you glance around and
suddenly shes right there in front of you And
you take your falchion swing out to try and take
her out
 Yep So you have disadvantage on the
strike
 But you do have plus ds to each of the hits
because of Bless
 Plus a d
 Yeah
  You duck out of the way
What the hell
 All right That ends Yashas turn Caleb
You are conscious prone floating sinking
towards the ground as you come to consciousness as
Yasha grabs and jolts you awake
 Yeah youd get half cover Yeah
 Getting up from prone
 Yeah you can get cover
 Thats d
 Correct So you have to roll a d add your
spell attack modifier
 Yes technically because he was
concentrating
 Her armor class is  Im so sorry
 You release the Witch Bolt and as it fires
out and arcs in a splitsecond moment the eyes go
wide and she darts out of the way and it impacts
the side of the stone wall You watch as the
seaweed she was clutching is burned and falls away
for a second and behind it you see another one
of those runes Just sitting there in the
chamber
 Thats your turn All right back at the
top Beau youre up
 Actually at the end of Calebs turn
 She has three Shes going to use her last
one Shes going to go ahead and use Shifting
Speed So shes going to move her speed without
triggering opportunity attacks

 Actually she can move ten more feet so
right there
 Yep As you watch she skitters across the
wall grabbing the seaweed and using it almost
Tarzanlike to thrust herself forward grabbing
onto this bit rolling and then swimming around
and is now floating in the air or floating in the
water right next to where Caduceus is standing
Beau what are you doing
 From you right now
  feet from you
 So you jump off the ground and swim forward
cruising through the room Step of the Wind you
get one extra push and you land right next to
where she is
 Go for it
 Yes because you are underwater still
 The first strike as you come forward this
is the first time you get a really good look at
the face of this terrible creature and as soon as
you come towards the mouth opens up and you
barely hold back from the punch and that just
gives it enough time to shift out of the way and
it just hits water
 That hits You know now that  is the armor
class
 Wisdom ability checks got it
 Nine Nine points of damage As the first
one misses and pulls away youre like Nope
Whack And then right across the jaw cracking
sound Cold and hard Theres a toughness to her
 All right Does that finish your turn
Beau
 All right Caduceus and Jester youre up
 She did technically move around and wouldve
passed through your foot radius by the way
 So she does have to make a wisdom saving
throw A five plus one Six So thats a failure
Go ahead and roll damage for your
 Spirit Guardians yes
 Caleb and Yasha are no longer frightened of
Dashilla Okay  So you watch as she darts
across the room as her legendary action All the
floating seahorses suddenly dart up and slam into
her side but she still manages to skitter past
All right so now its Jester and Caduceus turn
Because you guys are players Im giving you the
initiative just before the lair action hits
because youre all on  Go for it
 On her turn All right
 Technically the creatures movement is
halved when it moves through
 It only barely skimmed the side so it would
have lost five foot of movement so well say that
Dashilla is there
 No youre entering hers She has to enter
your area However at the start of her turn it triggers
 Ooh boy
 So where are you putting it
 Like right here Let her do it
 Go ahead and roll an attack
 Yes it does go ahead and roll damage on
that
 Well you cast it at thlevel you said
right Thats d
 Because its ndlevel normally each level
you put on top of that
 Yeah for every spell level ahead of two you
get another So  plus one more d
 All right So thats 
 No  Double eights is  plus seven is

 Yeah because of your wisdom So  points
of damage Whack The serrated edge of the
lollipop grinds into her As it does black blood
spills out from the wound of the chest the shreds
of seaweed and cloth pulling off from the front
exposing the sunken rib cage where the flesh is
pulled taut against and now the wound itself is
open and spilling this trail of cloudy black blood
in the water
 Yep Sacred Flame is a cantrip so go for
it Thats wisdom or dexterity
 Dexterity save That is going to be an 
 But that was a nice round
 All right finishing up Jesters turn
Caduceus
 You just watched her dart over you
essentially Ten feet up above scoot past land
and then both Jester and Beau converge and start
pummelling her in the hallway
 Welcome to Dungeons  Dragons
 Okay Dexterity save That is going to be a
 I dont believe that
 Yep so go ahead and roll damage on that
 Nine points of radiant damage nice spell
impact angry snarl
 So you turn invisible and youre going to
back up into here into this little corner
 Oh there
 Over here
 Got it And you are invisible there Good to
know All right at the end of your turn the lair
action kicks in Clouded Waters Now you watch as
the silt the muck and the bones all of a sudden
begin to swirl up into the waters around you and
obscure the area The entire lair is now
considered heavily obscured You cannot see more
than five feet in front of you
 Its now Dashillas turn She gets her
legendary actions back
 Oh shes not affected by the obscurity
This is her lair
 She does so immediately she has to take the
Spirit Guardians
 Wisdom ability checks not saving throws
Otherwise hex would be super powerful But she
still rolls a 
 So do full damage
 Okay
  points of radiant damage blasted again
as this cluster of vibrant glowing almost pink
pulsing sea horses swirl around and pierce through
her chest
 Unicorn horns of course I assumed
 Theyre just like wee
 Its very like that Perry Bible Fellowship
comic
 The kid gets impaled by the unicorns I love
it so much All right so that happens The top of
her turn Yeah nobodys currently feared by her
 No it lasts until the beginning of the next
combat round Okay shes going to go ahead and do
a multiattack with her claws against Beauregard
because shes in melee
 Thats two strikes against you these giant
bladed fingered claws First one is thats a
natural  plus seven Thats  to hit
 The second one is a natural 
 All right so you get hit from each You
take from the first strike  points of slashing
damage The second one  points of slashing
damage In what already was clouded silt is now
clouded further by your own blood from the slash
marks across the front and the side of your neck
and jaw and the pain sears through In an
instant all you see is the claws streaking
through and the glowing yellow eyes before they
rescind back into the cloud
 Well no shes going to attempt to move
back Make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage
 With that she vanishes into
 Yeah just all over Thats going to go
ahead and end Dashillas turn Fjord youre up
 Yes
 Youre a bit shaken by all these visions
that keep creeping into your head
 Yes I mean you saw her still dart and run
this way and then everything just went dark
around you and you cant see more than five feet
ahead of you
 Its heavily obscured which means you can
still attack that direction but its at disadvantage
 Mmhmm
 Okay wow that was
 All right Two strikes at disadvantage go
for it
 That still hits with disadvantage
 You watch as soon as everything clouds in
and you see her vanishing in that distant area
You throw them back out there and through sheer
luck and remembering where she was heading both
blasts you dont even see the impact but you
hear the  Roll damage on each of those
 Nice
 Oof there were some good rounds in that
All right thats your action
 Okay youre going to stay there by the
throne
 That finishes your go Fjord Next up it is
Nott
 You have no idea where she is You know that
shes somewhere in this tunnel
 Or in that direction
 Youre heavily obscured so you can literally
hide anywhere right now
 Youre in a cloud of murk and gathered
sediment
 Are you hiding then as a bonus
 Roll stealth
 Okay and then you are holding
 Okay you got it All right that finishes
your go Yashas turn
 Yeah
 Its less
 Yeah not that Yasha would understand with
her comparatively limited experience of arcane
stuff but its not so much magical darkness than
it is as much of sediment and silt up in the air
by some sort of its up to her she can give it
a shot
 All right
 While staying there
 You got it
 Yes it does Okay that ends Yashas go
Caleb
 Okay go for it
 You cast Detect Magic in a  foot radius
around you You sense a powerful magical essence
from the throne next to Fjord
 Right there
 Okay that ends your turn
 All right at the end of your turn
Dashillas going to use a legendary action to use
Forced Vision on you Fjord As youre there by the
side you look over by the corner and you see
you dont see Caleb You see a spirit rushing up
towards you with an open maw Go ahead and make an attack
 No
 Because she had Patient Defense on
 Hes not affected by it because of his
armor Hes got Mariners Armor
 Yeah no As you swing that little bit in
the back of your brain resists and you can see
for a moment through the illusion
 With your mage armor I think youre okay
right
 Yeah you manage to just pull back enough to
pull the blade back and Caleb you watch as it
spins past missing you by inches
 All right
 Top of the round Its Beaus go
 Its made of fucking cookies
 You dont know
 She disappeared Youre surrounded by cloud
you can barely see Jester at the peripheral and
the floating Spiritual Weapon and you watch her
vanish into this swirling bit of murk
 Okay
 You got it All right so youre holding
your attack action That ends your turn Caduceus
and Jester
 Correct
 You got it
 You reappear
 There
 Oh like here
 Okay so youre holding Sacred Flame
 Okay All right so youre holding Sacred
Flame you said right
 What are you doing Jester
 Sure go ahead and roll attack with
disadvantage
 It hits the fuck out of nothing shes not
there unfortunately
 Okay At the end of the turn the sediment
drops The moment it drops she appears
 She is over here
 Nope but both of you get to fire at her
You unfortunately do not see her shes around the
corner from you
 So excited in the moment
 Thats amazing All right so roll your
damage
 Yep
 Natural 
 Next attack has advantage on her yeah
Shes starting to look pretty hurt As it blasts
into her and lights up the vicinity between the
gash and the various impacts from the Eldritch
Blasts and the punches from Beau and now where
that impacted theres now a darkened burned
crater in the center of the chest thats beginning
to ooze out blood Shes like 
All right Reappears at which point the next
lair action is going to be Tethering Walls Any
creature within ten feet of a wall must make a
dexterity saving throw Thats going to be Jester
Beaus just out of range Caduceus Everybody but
Jester ten feet from a wall
 Yeah No sorry everybody but Beau Beaus
the one whos central to this chamber
 She does Whats up
 Dex save yes
 Success
 Great success
 Im sorry not you
 Success
 Success
 Caduceus as the seaweed extends outward
most of you manage to duck out of the way
However it wraps around and pulls Caduceus to the
wall You are grappled and you take  points of
poison damage
 That ends that It is now Dashillas turn
Dashilla is going to go ahead and move ten feet up
to Jester
 Well she actually started within the range
so she makes it You do
 You do Go ahead and make your attack

 points of slashing damage from the second
 Thats ten feet of movement and shes going

 Go for it
 Nice Dashillas looking really bad
 As it happens these ice crystals formulate
out of the seawater and all crossjettison into
her body Now theyre embedded in her chest and
torso these large crystals of shards of jagged
ice  Eyes going wide looks around
Shes going to use the rest of her movement
 Speed is halved on the movement so thats
 
 Well not  technically because  is her
swimming speed So right there
 Thats the end of Dashillas turn Fjord
youre up first
 Yeah It is water There is a vertical
aspect you guys can use if you want to
 Okay Theres this cloud of sand and dust
and bones that get scattered up from your leap
Youre up in the air and then throw both forward
Roll attacks
 Both hit Roll damage
  points on the second one
 Okay Fuck man shes right on the cusp
All right That finishes your turn
 Legendary action shes going to Shifting
Speed

 Hex doesnt work that way Thats Hunters
Mark All right that finishes Fjords turn Nott
 
You still dont see her
 All right that ends your turn Yasha
 He used action movement and bonus
 It is now Yasha
 If she rages in advance she can use
advantage on the athletics check Up to you
 Yes Athletics with advantage
 s enough The DC to break is 
 Its seaweed But yeah She reaches forward
and grabs Caduceus and pulls him away from the
side so now youre no longer grappled You can
move
 Thats her action and her bonus That
finishes Yashas go Caleb youre up
 You got it
 Okay That finishes Calebs go Top of the
round Beau

 She hasnt had a chance to hide yet
 You see her right there

Ill say
 Oh with burning an action you can get
there

 Okay
 That a double move
 Thats as far as you can get on your single
move there
 Rogues man
 Yeah because its your action to move
 Right there all right You move

technically  you only move  All right that
finishes Jesters turn All of the seaweed falls
back into a casual place The next lair action is
going to be the Lament of the Dead
 The dead spirits now begin to fall through
at different angles out of the sides of the walls
and drifting through Everybody once more needs to
make a wisdom saving throw
 Everybody
 Through the halls through everything
 Success
 Success
 Yes DC is  on this
 Both successes
 Success
 Success
 Huh
 Yeah wow You guys all cleared that check
Nice
 Lair action no effect All right
 No dont apologize
 Dashillas turn Dashillas somewhere
Fjord what do you do
 Make a search action
 Make an investigation check for me Ill say
with advantage because you have the falchion
drawn You can sense the presence of something
important
 Correct
  will do it Going to the throne and
sensing with the sword like a homing beacon you
feel the strong source where the cushion in the
front of the throne is Its partially rotted and
you can see where once was red nice velvet
materials has blackened over time and general
sediment in the area and then minerals begin to
gather at the corners You reach down and tear
across the front and pull it open and as you do
there immediately glowing from underneath you see
the yellow sphere giving off a faint aura of
light
 Ill let you do that yeah
 You take it
 Ill say for the time being there is no
immediate threat Dashilla has fled You can
continue to search for her if youd like
 Okay but for the time being Dashilla has
not at least for the time being
 It does
 Okay You continue to move into the next
area
 You scoot around the area Beau you start
moving through in this vicinity
 Nott you doing the same
 Nott youre not as fast as her so youre
falling a bit behind Actually no you can do all
three with your bonus action Well you both can
just in case you want to spend ki points
 Yes
 Only the aura from the table
 Okay make an arcana check
 Its hard to pick up the details of these
particular runes They seem of a similar age as
the ones you saw on the table but its not the same
enchantment You pick up that they are placed
there for some reason but youre unable to
ascertain what it is unfortunately
 Right okay It is not a language per se
These arent passages or language being
transmitted these are runes of some kind
They are used to channel something
They may or may not be connected to the
table altar in the center
 Yeah
 They both get brighter
 Yes you may As you take the sphere and
press it to your chest your eyes suddenly flash
images of black subocean darkness the same
place your dreams have brought you over and over again and
that bright yellow light emerges breaking the
shadow and there you see the yellow eye with two
more on the sides of it You see the endless row
of teeth that curves into the smile and the
flash is gone and you look down and your hand is
empty The rest of you watched this thing
momentarily seem to become either ethereal or it
is absorbed into Fjords chest You look at the
sword and now theres the eye in the hilt and the
eye in the pommel
 While youre beginning to initiate the
looting process what are you doing Caduceus
 Okay Well you were staying over in this
chamber with them Nott and Beau you are in the
central chamber now Do you want to search for the
possible whereabouts of Dashilla
 Both of you make perception checks
 All right As you turn around the corner and
you edge in here you see movement behind the
seaweed using it as a blanket and a shield
 Where youre looking you see it move this
direction Youre not sure which path but
Dashilla is still present it seems or something
moving through the seaweed as a cover behind it
like a curtain Which path do you choose
 Which way
 You saw her move in the direction of this
fork
 This side You saw her move in this
direction you saw it move through
 Take the right Okay You move through and
youre following
 Okay
 As you come around the corner you see an
old decomposing pile of merrow corpses similar to
the ones that were tied up inside but these all
have these wounds of their throats slit from side
to side
 Theyre all in various states of
decomposition the freshest one maybe months ago
and the sea has caused its own unique form of
bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of
the skeleton
 You can make another perception check
 Glancing inside and taking a moment to
really look around theres no other movement
 You guys shift around
 As you turn around to the other side there
you see standing there another pale gaunt spirit
looking right at you
 Beauregard doing probably one of my
favorite things shes ever done in this entire
campaign just runs up to fucking punch a ghost
Go for it
  just hits
 Five points of damage okay
 Another five damage okay
 You still have your bonus action
  points of damage You punch the shit out
of a ghost Now because I believe at level seven
you have the capability of
 To punch ghosts
 With each punch you watch as the somewhat
spectral glow scatters at each impact and as she
pulls back there are three holes in its form where
the fists passed through The ghost which was
normally just staring goes  in
surprise
 That is a three
 All righty Nott are you doing anything
 Ghost is still alive yeah
 Go for it
  hits roll damage It is adjacent to Beau
so you get sneak attack on the ghost
 It dissipates You watch as its glow
vanishes This horrible low dull vibrating sigh
slowly goes away and its no more and hes
immaterial
 Make a perception check
 Both of you guys make perception checks
 Okay You dont see any movement in that
corner You do looking inside see in the far
back a small hole maybe two inches across where
the base of it of the small alcove ends You
hear voices
 Its about two inches wide
 As youre looting the place you hear these
voices
 Okay You suffer three points of damage As
you place your hand down on it you see this dull
red glow around the hand thats placed on the
table As you begin to pull your hand up and look
the runes where the blood has splattered have
begun to give a faint glow
 Make a perception check
 You glance over and you can see a faint
matching dull red glow on one of the runes across
the way just barely peeking through some of the
gently shifting seaweed Looking down at this
table you need a lot of blood to continue to do
this
 How much damage are you willing to take
guys
 As you guys begin carving into your hands
 Okay The blood clouds the water around you
and then you watch as it is drawn like a magnet to
the tabletop As it begins to sit itself in each
of the runes begins to pull in with each one
glowing another rune and the rune 
Its almost full the table isnt there yet You
have about twothirds to threequarters or so The
room itself now is beginning to generally have a
red hue to it as each of these runes is beginning
to fill the area
 Make an investigation check
 Yeah
 I know You gather in pocket and counting
it later you will find that you have found
roughly three platinum six gold  silver and
about  copper
 Shes got an uncomfortable look on her face
after watching all this transpire goes Yeah I
think we better should
 Her brow tenses and she follows you out As
you all converge towards the central chamber once more
 As youre walking some of the seaweed
reaches out and the unicorns  It lasts
for ten minutes right As you approach they
eventually flitter out You all gather there at
the entrance
 Are you all backing out of the cavern
 Okay For those who havent rolled
perception checks on this which I think would be
Jester Caleb and Fjord go ahead and roll for
me And Yasha
 No sign of movement No idea where she is
 Thanks to the glory of magic were not
going to deal with decompression in the bloodstream
 Instant TPK
 Well the magic is pulling Yeah its
fine Magic handwave Itd be the saddest Smash
cut to the outside of the Squalleater
 Its all just the end of Total Recall right
there in the middle of the ocean
 I know Im saying through the magic it all
works out fine As you guys all swim out of the
cavern the spell happens With immense speed you
all start firing towards the surface 
with enough force that when you surface you all
lift a few feet out and then land Some of you
stumble but you hit the surface of the water and
it feels like ground
 You guys can see the Squalleater is a bit of
a hike from where you currently are from where
youve traveled but it is visible as there is no
other landmass on the horizon
 Correct
 You guys make your way towards the
Squalleater hail your team and are brought back
onto the ship The sails are unfurled As Orly
turns to you he goes Where we going Captain
 Gravid Archipelago all righty
 Aye aye
 Youre not there
 The ship unfurls the functional sails on it
and slowly limps its way in the direction of the
archipelago You travel for a good hour or so
before you notice the sky that was somewhat
cloudy begin to go rapidly darker roughly near
where you were The clouds begin to swell and
release rain It begins to rain on your ship but
you begin to push away from this mounting storm
 You get the sense that whatever ritual you
began once she felt safe she had completed and a
new storm is being summoned over the Divers
Grave
 At least there would have been a hell of a
skill challenge to get the Squalleater out of the
center of that storm As you barely skirt the
outside of this growing storm with enough
foresight and speed to not be caught in the brunt
of it well end tonights game
 Bisaft Isle to get repairs done
 All right Well pick up there next week
and well have a guest next week
 Yeah excited Well be having Deborah Ann
Woll joining us

 Three years in the making I think it is
 At least two Excited shes going to be
joining us and well pick up this next thread of
the story Well done guys That was fun and
Dashilla survived
 Yeah if that had happened while you guys
got out of the cave you would have looked up and
that sunlight was much darker and it would have
been you start seeing the shifting in the
tumultuous surface and be like Oh no
 Sometimes you got to poke the badger and I
respect that
 All right well pick that up next week
Once again fantastic job on the intro and Kami
and Kevin and everyone involved with the music It
was such a great job Im so happy with how that
turned out Thank you for joining us tonight we
love you and is it Thursday yet Good night





 Role Critical Role

 Welcome back That was adorable Laura Last
exorbitant period of time at sea at the behest of
Captain Avantika on the ship the Squalleater got
pulled into piracy under the banner of The
Revelry brought to the pirate city and island of
Darktow amongst the Dragshallow Reefs There you
uncovered information proof that she had plans to
overthrow the Plank King and rule the seas along
with her fanatical obsession with Ukotoa
 I knew it was coming You manage to dodge
through the night grab the necessary journal
uncover the information through the cipher and
through a scuffle survive this fiery battle on
the docks from the ship Through some tactical use
of spells and quick members of your party you got
it in the hands of the Plank King Judgement was
brought between the two of you at the dock and he
chose Avantika to go Upon having her make her
leave violently gave you guys your reward which
was sparing your lives and telling you to get the
fuck out of Darktow and never come back You were
gifted the hobbled burned form of the Squalleater
and left to make your way out towards the ocean
where you attempted to search into the backstory
of Fjords relationship with his patron in search
of one of what seems to be the third and final
sphere You made your way down into the wreckage
of his ship The Tides Breath and discovered it
was one of many in what was called the Divers
Grave a ship graveyard here in the center of the
Lucidian Ocean In trying to find out where this
orb went you were drawn into the underwater lair
of Dashilla the Dreadful You encountered spirits
of longdead sailors bound there by her magic You
discovered the essence of how shes able to
maintain this graveyard and draw ships down below
While she managed to flee before being killed you
grabbed what you were looking for fled to the
surface and with your ship escaped the growing
storm before any more danger was brought to you
That was where we left off Mighty Nein as youve
all gathered your things you can hear the distant
crack of thunder as the storm gets smaller behind
you on the horizon What do you want to do
 Three or four days from where you are now
 Of course dont you worry He goes ahead
and sets course The ship makes its turn across
the water in the direction of the Bisaft Isle
 Bisaft
 Yes
 To that degree you guys have a few days of
travel anything youd like to accomplish in this
time Youve taken a long rest for the first
evening Youre restored if you need to restore
your spells and hit points
 What is your small list Nott
 Yes
 Sure
 Sure lets do it Lets give it a shot
Roll a tinkering check
 Are you proficient with the tinkers tools
 Its under your proficiencies
 You are
 Its already powder Its already explosive
Youre just constructing a casing and a means of
detonation Just roll and add your dexterity
modifier
 Yes
 Okay You make two
 The third one
 In the crows nest as Fjord
 Okay
 The first one goes by easy as heck Youre
proud of yourself Second one a little tenuous
but you manage to craft it and thats nice The
third one roll a perception check
 You in all the excitement and your minds
eye focusing entirely on all the wonderful
explosions this is going to cause arent paying
attention to the wire youre using to seal off
where the head of the explosive bolt goes As you
pull through a series of lucky circumstances a
spark gets hit Theres a brief moment where you
hear that  and youre like Oh Theres
just a flash Roll a dexterity check for me a
dexterity saving throw
 Its still a two though Plus
 You really should
 Correct Unless your cloak gives you
advantage on dexterity saving throws
 Correct So you failed
 In that explosion  points of fire damage
you suffer halved because of your evasion trait
so thatll put us at six You take six points of
fire damage as theres this brief explosion that
rocks the vicinity and your ears ring You grab
the sides of your face as your eyes attempt to
focus In that brief instant you see a shape move
through the center of the galley
 Make a perception check
 Everything seems safe
 As you guys look up you can see this
smattering of dark soot all across her face The
hairs scattered
 No last you saw Vera she was burned pretty
bad
 Beau and Nott
 The three of you head down past the galley
or the kitchen where you originally saw the shape
move Youre now towards the center where the
cannons and the accessible stores of gunpowder
are You guys can see the scarring mark on the
wood there where the previous explosion happened
 Make a perception check
 Okay then You glance past the galley you
dont see any movement You glance across the
opposite side near where the stairway leads into
the cargo hold below You look past and you swear
you see something looking back from around one of
the barrels then disappear behind it and you
hear 
 Its possible Where you saw it was right
next to the stairs that lead down into the cargo
hold Whatever the shape was it moved behind one
of the large barrels there made a run for it
hoping it wouldnt be seen and then went
downstairs
 Into the cargo hold yes
 Okay so blocking off the area Everyone
make a stealth check please
 Okay that tips the scales a bit then You
guys are quietly making your way down there
hearing the creaking of wood and the very faint
muffled sounds of waves crashing against the
outside of the Squalleater You see a shape duck
down even further back in the cargo hold behind
one of the box clusters
 Its too far away and theres no light down
there
 All of you have darkvision as long as you
have the goggles on
 You guys dart around with the booming voice
of Jesters duplicitous double There curved
around the corner you manage to all at the same
time flank in this area As you get around the
space you can see theyre huddled in the corner
If youd like to come to the table

 And describe to them what they see
the littlest ball I have created an illusion of a
halo over my head so I look like a perfect little
angel Its just a tiny little gnome girl You
would have no idea how old I am Im really cute
and theres sticks in my hair and I got singed a
little bit so one cheeks covered in soot I have
really pretty necklaces
 In her gnomish hands this is pretty large
From your perspective it would be about that big
but for her it seems even that much bigger Its a
brass and golden sphere that consists of many
layers of intertwining clockwork sliding
hemispheres rotating bands and strange
inscriptions Its this massive complicated mess
of contraption puzzle sliding pieces
 Make an arcana check
  While she holds it out to you parts
that shes not touching are shifting slightly to
where it has a clockwork feel But then you dont
see any gears in the parts that are shifting
Theyre sliding naturally with a very faint whir
You can tell theres probably some magic involved
but its a combination of clockwork and magic
 You may
back one ring As it pulls around across at the
same time I click another one to the side It
slides around the side and
 As the last part clicks into place theres
a  a burst of light About  gold
coins go  to the ground in front
 You crack a tooth
 What she reveals as she pulls out of this
bright pink satchel this colored leather satchel
she has is this dodecahedron shape that has gold
trim around the edges and these handles It looks
like a gray quartz and it has a very faint hum to
it It seems to glow in a rhythmic heartbeat
fashion It has this very strong presence and the
air around it has its own subtle vibration
 Which as you do that you feel this
gravitational pull your essence drawn towards it
Your peripheral blurs and darkens Within you
feel like youre leaning into it Its no longer
an object its like a pool of water and you
cross the surface and its warm Past that in
the darkness you see stars an endless sea of
stars drifting towards you and past you You look
ahead and you can see other little shapes You
look at them and theyre you Theyre little
ghosted versions of Twiggy Theyre all going in
different directions and some of them fade and
some of them are created Two of them join and
create a new light and go in a separate path In
that moment you see this single glowing warm
light that appears and presents itself to you
 As you reach out and put your hand towards
it it merges with your hand The warmth carries
through your wrist and forearm
 It gives this warm interior hugtype
sensation As you close your eyes to relish in it
and open them again youre back on the boat with
them
 Okay As a note you have whats called a
Fragment of Possibility For the rest of the day
anytime you have to make an attack roll an
ability check or a saving throw any roll with a
d essentially you get to reroll it You get to
roll an additional d and choose which of the two
to take
 Just once
 Yeah
 Actually probably even keel between the two
of you
 At this point around the side Marius
LePual has walked down into the center of the ship
and is standing there Who the fuck is that
 Youre all scaring me right now Im going
to go lay down
 Okay you guys all make you your way back up
to the deck of the Squalleater As you hear the
footsteps rising you look back to hopefully hear
information about how things went down with the
supposed sound and stowaway Instead you see them
arrive with Twiggy
 Port Damali
 Make an insight check
 Is there anything you want to whisper to
him Feel free to
 Okay
 Bisaft Isle
 So youre concentrating on
 Okay so continue while youre doing that
 Caleb as you finish the ritual your vision
crystallizes on the object As part of the
Identify the information that would transition to
you fails
 Youve tried to Identify nonmagical objects
before and been like oh this isnt magical
This blocks you
 Do not solve happy fun ball
 Make a history check Low DC since youre
relatively local
 Theres not so much in the way of museums
per se but there are collections There are
collectors and those are usually private and
inviteonly through mutual merchants and nobles
and people of affluent nature But there are two
auction houses where a lot of these items are sold
and traded by these collectors One exists in Port
Damali Its called the Exalted Collection Auction House
 Make a perception check
somewhere I go where the wind blows
 As youre inspecting this there are
sections of it Rubiks Cubeesque where you have
to rotate an area to allow another part to rotate
and theres a strange order to these One for
things that should be rotating freely theres a
consistent resistance to it You also notice
between the seams where all of these pieces of
metal overlap where theres a slight gap if you
manage to hold it in shadow or put shadow over it
theres a very faint bluegreen glow that barely
peeks through each seam from the inside of this
sphere There definitely is magic Youre a smart
guy Youre starting to look it over Youre like
some of these patterns maybe could figure it out
You do notice that a lot of the strange
inscriptions on it appear to be complicated
variations of basic conjuration glyphs None that
youve seen but you can see the similar shapes
the similar equationtype connection between these
glyphs
 There is a strong conjuration element all
across and very minute impossibly small
engraving across the metal
 No idea All the metals pretty well kept
Its pretty polished Theres a couple of errant
smears of chocolate caught in some aspects of it
a few sticky fingerprints in some areas
 This time  you see this flash of
white light and eight gold coins clank to the
surface of the ship
 Okay  white flash Four gold coins
 Yeah Nott already took them
I missed it
 Roll an investigation check
 Okay You find one section that shifts
following suit with her and it sticks Yeah
youre not getting anywhere
 Make a wisdom saving throw
 I know
 Whos got the sphere
 There is a powerful magical essence
emanating from that sphere
 A different kind of magic but comparable to
the dodecahedron in some ways
 Yeah and there is two faint magical auras
on her person
 He would be able to tell if there was
something magical on your person He wouldnt know
any more than that
 Make a perception check as you clamber up to
the top of the crows nest and glance over the horizon
 Looking off in the horizon you currently
dont see any ships that are immediately pushing
into the territory Youre following Fjord
 It stings you a little bit Your wounds
still fresh
 You do also know as youre heading into
legal territory under the Clovis Concord that you
have a ship that is known and labelled as the
Squalleater as damaged as it is
 Roll a dexterity check for me
 This is dexterity to see how well you can
paint it while upside down
 Apparently Not only does she manage to
entirely erase the beginning of the word Squall
but has beautifully calligraphied the B of Ball
to where it looks almost like a set of balls if
interpreted that way It has this nice sparkly
border around it now Its like 
Balleater Its almost got jazz hands
 This is regular paint
 Good to know
 There are no colors on deck that arent
associated with it The only colors that are on
deck were the colors that the ship previously
sailed
 Make a history check Caleb
 You keep thinking on that sphere Youve
read about similar objects especially the
conjuration aspect of it that are used as
focuses similar to a bag of holding to maintain
and contain things for powerful mages Its
construction makes you feel like its very old
Probably preCalamity
 PreCalamity is  years and theres a
whole era of very powerful magic
 No  years ago was the Calamity Or a
little over 
 As this is happening and youre approaching
Caleb you see Orly sitting there with his giant
tortle arms looking up with his craned tortle
neck and going Hmm
 Far too long
 Make a wisdom saving throw
 So yeah it takes effect
try to sit in your lap
 Every time she goes into that pouch and
opens it up you can still see taking up a large
portion of it massively like a distended
backpack is the slightly shifting clockwork of
that sphere
 Well until the directed activity is
completed
 Then yeah so Suggestion has worn off
a high five Down below

 Most awkward onship high five ever
 As your new compatriot for this journey
seems to have for the time being accepted into
your wings is there anything else you want to
do
 All right so youre getting that situated
 From this point a little over three days
 So The Traveler she explains to you in a
very truncated way is the being that she worships
but talks with and taught her a bunch of things
and theyve been a friend Anything else you want
 Make an investigation check
 Doing a thorough pass on the crews
quarters the remnant of the crew that now is
arrested or worse on the island of Darktow yes
You manage to scavenge up two boxes of firearm ammunition
 Yes actually
 Yeah from Hupperdook I think it was
right
 You manage to pull together  shots
 That fit yours There are a few others that
dont quite Theyre made for a larger rifletype
but these particular iron balls will fit yours
 Oh yeah There are plenty of coats hats
scarves all kinds of things Most of them in a
similar vein to what you see her wearing Most of
them are long coats with the sleeves removed a
high collar Big billowing scarves and cravats
that are varying degrees of well kept A lot of
these shes had for a long time and as such at
sea theres weathering Some of them have grown
damp and have a little mildew at the very edges
but have been scraped off multiple times which
give it a cool look but maybe a little bit of a
musty smell
 Theres a number of interesting outfits of a
dead woman that you manage to scavenge
 Anything else
 Yeah We can continue this journey to the
second day if you want to but its up to you
 
 Make an investigation check
doing
 You rolled a  you said
 As youre saying this absentmindedly you
find another portion of it that previously was
locked in place and wouldnt move You manage to
rotate one band and all of a sudden it comes free
and turns as well You start shifting it a bit
and as you turn a little cylinder extends a
little bit and you press on it and you hear
 Theres another burst but this one has a
dull blue color to the burst of light Suddenly
four cut jade pieces of stone appear and hit the ground
 Each ones worth about  gold if you want
to mark that down
 Roll another investigation check I guess
 From that place where you had it you find
one of the other grinding bands it felt like
sandpaper when you tried to move it is now
moving smooth like it has no resistance so you
twist that one around and as you do you hear this
clicking sound It fits into place Theres
another piece around that you hear give this very
faint  sound You look for it and you
find it and theres a little knob You turn the
knob and as you do another section opens up on
one side and then theres this flash and you look
over on the ground and in the middle of the wood
theres a black hole about a foot wide
 No you look and its just black
 No
 As you let go they make no sound They just
disappear into it
 No you just see Fjord and Beau go down
 Okay it gets to about five or six feet
 Okay Its rope
 Okay Temperature feels a little colder but
it goes in
  Its gone
 It was about a foot across so a smaller
person maybe but a lot of you guys it would have
been a tight squeeze Not Caduceus at all
 She takes this couple of materials out and
this pot of paint As she paints with it it
begins to take shape and become a physical object
representative of what she drew
 The sphere is still locked in the place
where you had it last and theres that one little
knob thats still visible from where it was It
seems like with each stage that youve unlocked
of this its opened up another stage
 A little bit
 Less smooth and there are more elements
that are starting to protrude a bit
 All you have to do is press on that to
trigger it again
  That hole appears again
 Same size in a slightly different
location
 As the lantern hits the darkness the
darkness consumes it like water Once the lantern
is submerged within the darkness no light You
dont even see the lantern
 Still lit
 Mmhmm
 Its gone It only lasts about a minute
 Each time its lasted about a minute yeah
 Both times its been approximately the same
length of time close to a minute
 The hole opens up
 You look inside its darkness
 Still darkness You can put your goggles on
if you want
 Put goggles on and your face as he pushes
you down further you hit something Its soft
You pull back a bit and look and theres a pile
of objects there
 Okay As you pull her out before she slips
 As youre pulling back a few things start
tumbling out of this thing You grab them and pull
them in You pull out and she emerges You have
this pile of reddish cloth and a strange metal
object of some kind and a couple other things
You pull the rest of them out thats dangling in
As soon as it does the hole closes
 You look at it First off
 Shes pulling her tongue out
 First off you hear  as two boots
fall out of this pile of clothes she has these
really nice leather boots that are fur on the top
They hit the ground Theres a metal rod that
looks like a staff that you hold and pull there
The other thing is a bundle of this really heavy
warm wintercoat velvet material Its a deep
crimsonred color with golden trim on it As you
unravel it theres an embroidered symbol across
the back of it Thats the symbol right there
 You do not You guys have never seen this
before
 I mean youre looking at it there Theres
not much more to it than that
 That watermark is part of the paper Its
not part of the actual symbol
 Its a metal staff You look at it and its
a metallic staff about three to four feet long
It has a seam in the middle of it like its two
pieces joined
 Well say for the sake of brevity the
boots are not magical Theyre just really warm
boots The cloak is not magical its just a very
warm cloak
 With the symbol on it The staff is faintly
magical and what it is is it acts like a hand
warmer You take the two parts and you slide them
together and it clicks The metal emanates enough
heat to warm the hands of whoevers holding it
This appears to be a set of travel gear for
whoever once might have had this
 Yep Halas
 Halas HALAS
  Mmmm
 It seems to have some roots in Zemnian but
its a divergent element so a name that hasnt
been used in a long long time Kind of like
 Yeah like Melchor Things that are old
historical names In fact roll a history check
 It slips from you Theres something Youre
like hmm
 Your face hit the cloak You were like
 into this pile of soft heavy material
 A couple of ball bearings fall out of the
cloak from what was dropped in there earlier
 Nothing
 Her hand
shell let me
 One by one you guys jump in one after the
other and you both tumble in and hit a floor
 Looking around you both have darkvision
because gnomes Its a cylindrical chamber It
feels almost like a natural rock interior
exits
 No Its just a little pocket
 You see two other ball bearings you left
behind and thats it It looks like youve
cleaned out what was in this pocket
 You guys emerge
 The area on the sphere where youve been
pressing this button you look and its freed
another area as well that can continue to be
solved
 As it looks right now you need to shift it
back to use a previous function Each thing you
slide unlocks the next use but it closes off the
previous one until you reverse it
 You wouldnt
 Cadigan
 Oh Halas You roll a history check too
 Yeah roll a history check
 If they did teach it you probably werent
paying attention that day at the Archive unfortunately
Cadigan the person I took it from
 Roll a history check
 No None at all Youve never heard the name
Halas before anywhere in Port Damali or in any of
your travels especially in relation to Sir
Cadigan
 nope Sir Cadigan was a big old
meanie but I dont think he had anything to do
with this
 Okay you all step back about ten paces
Anyone want to help or you going with your
standard roll
 Yep
 Okay That hole appears again Youre unable
to get past that point Youre hitting a barrier
and youre clicking it forward Theres something
about the puzzle thats escaping you You feel
like youre not quite youre on the cusp
 If you want to try it again
practicing Let me try
 If you want to either you both can roll
individually or one of you can roll with
advantage as youre helping the other
 As you hand the sphere over holding the
places Twiggy goes in and takes hold of it Both
of you together begin to try and rotate and figure
it out
hard and I roll a 
 At that point both together Twiggy finds
this small rotating piece on the very edge that
turns and turns As it does another cylindrical
sphere slowly emits from it like youre rotating
a pencil lead that pushes out
same time
 You twist it and you push it in and it
actually pushes in about an inch and then clicks
inside recessed As that happens a top part
opens up a little bit Caleb you take that and
rotate it As it clicks into place you hear
 Flash of green light
 Fills the entire chamber Thats where were
going to go to break

 Well that was a fun campaign guys It was
a lot of fun

the game we do have a winner The winner of our
fantastic Wyrmwood dice vault giveaway this
evening is Antcclueless Congratulations on your
complicated online name and your victory Well
get this sent to you ASAP So a flash of green
light energy fills the chamber As it subsides
you all take a second to blink as the light is
dimmer than it was on the inside of the ship
Looking about you are in a very dark chamber
Youre no longer on the ship
 All of you Except for Yasha because she
was not nearby This chamber is somewhat
triangular but the corners are curved At each of
these walls between each curvature there is a
banner hanging about  feet off the ground on a
brass rod The banner hangs almost to the floor
You see four pillars a little closer inside the
chamber Each banner is a different color The
ceilings about  feet high and there are two
corpses on the floor nearby Both longdead and
mummified their skin paperthin and pulled
against their bones their faces twisted in
horror You see the light gray stone walls and
where these banners are there are two on the side
parallel to each other and two on the other There
is a red a green a blue and a black Each of
these banners has gold embroidery down the sides
and a gold embroidered symbol in the middle The
same symbol as the cloak that you found
with us
 Nope
 Mmhmm
 No
 There are four pillars They are smooth
They appear to be either decorative or
loadbearing but there is nothing about them that
catches your eye If you want to take a closer
look you can make an investigation check if you
want
 Stone as well
 Pretty solid and featureless
 They are both wearing clothing
 Theres not much dust on them Which means
either its fresh or not a lot of dust to have collected
 From what you can see none Make a medicine
check
 Theres a faint aura or a faint scent but
either these corpses do not emanate a lot of
smell or it has faded in time
banner aside to see if there is anything behind there
 Okay Just to give you guys a visual
representation
 Placing yourselves where you would like to
be in here if you dont mind telling me where
youd like to be placed
 One here and one here
 Their faces are twisted in a horrible
expression of ghastly terror or pain but you
dont see any wounds Did you roll a medicine
check
 Yeah you dont see any wounds or any
gashes
 Their last moments were probably pretty
terrifying You moved aside the
 The blue one
 Okay As it pulls behind it reveals to be a
statue that is embedded in the wall behind it Up
on hind legs with claws in front you see a dragon
made of stone carved wings blending up into the
stone behind it Its mouth open its eyes these
very bright sapphires embedded in its head
Immediately as it opens up the mouth lights up
blue Make a dexterity saving throw And Caleb and Nott
 Correct
 What did you roll
 Okay still half damage
 Failure
 You take no damage Nott as you dodge away
The rest of you watch as this bolt of blue energy
fires outward as a thick beam of electrical energy
shoots across the room It hits by and skims the
front torso of Twiggy as she pulls out of the way
You watch Caleb spin and take it straight to the
chest as Nott ducks out of the way
 Caleb you take  points of lightning
damage Twiggy you take nine
 Okay
the electricity
 Okay Also make a concentration check
 For Mage Hand I believe Mage Hand is
concentration
 Oh no it lasts for a minute Im sorry
you dont need to It maintains itself Thats my bad
 It did It went  across
 It hit the tapestry and dissipated The
electrical energy didnt seem to impact or hurt anything
front of that
 It covers the statue
 Is anyone else adjusting their position or
are you staying where you are
 Yeah It went  through the
chamber
that
 Where do you want to go
 All right Caduceus the one nearest to you
youre casting
 As you sit there for a second holding your
staff your shield strapped over the arm your
hand goes down You close your eyes and focus and
the corpse on the ground staring off its eyes
dull and the pupils smoky and gray breathes in
its chest seems to inhale and it holds the air
there awaiting your questions
 The wailing creature
 Onyx black
 We had found an object and toyed with it
 Nothing
 Four questions youve got one more
 No That final bit of trapped air in the
lung escapes and it falls to stillness once more
 Okay so youre casting Decompose on him
 Its a little tight on you but it fits
Youre slender for a halforc
 You can be fit and slender
 Okay
 A tenfoot radius would be a bit bigger than
that so that would be the tenfoot radius
 So everyone is moving into it
 Theres not a whole lot of space there
 Dont make this the second time Ive taken a
hand of yours
 Sorry So
have to be able to hear it do I need to stick my
head out
 As far as you know it doesnt affect you in
a volume or noise way
my hand and that silvery spectral hand comes off
and it goes forward toward the green I pull my
own hand back and get back into the space and I
tell it to push the green flag aside
 You have to move over here probably to get
into range As you pull back the green tapestry
 You crouch down Okay As you pull it back
you see a statue behind it that looks to be some
horribly mutated humanoid creature Its body is
bulbous and covered in sores its neck is swollen
like a toads its mouth and jaw open with rows of
teeth all made of stone As it pulls back this
gaseous green fume spews from its mouth that fills
the chamber around it About half the chamber
begins to fill with this before it dissipates but
it does not cross the boundaries of the hut
 What are you doing next
 It pulls aside the red Behind it you see
emerge a wooden door of redpainted material and
the similar symbol of Halas painted across the
surface
 There is a handle there
  Its locked
 The hand hovers across Roll an ability
check adding your dexterity modifier and your
proficiency modifier
 It takes a few minutes This is an intricate
lock As you watch the hand finish with the third
tool that is being held between the mystical
pinkie you hear a slight clink like a spring
snapped or moved The front of the door here
bursts into flame burning out in the area It
burns solid for a good  seconds Surrounded by
flame all of you are being lit by this Youre
wincing from the heat you feel you should be
feeling but its all being held at bay by the
huts boundaries Eventually the flames die out
the door tapestry both untouched
keys ow Back in my pouch
 Yeah theyre very hot
 Sure Make an investigation check
 There are no pockets on the robe
 Yeah Its a heavy cloak if you will
 It triggered something but you feel
confident
handle again
  It opens up
 Go for it
 Whew You give a thorough pass They are
picked clean In fact you find the belt on one of
them seems to have been broken forcefully and a
couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where
a belt pouch may have been resting for a while
Missing Somebody has completely rolled these
corpses and picked them clean already
 Make a medicine check
 I mean you glance around the areas Theres
not much to really pull from that type of
material You dont see any heavy bruising like
they were forcefully pulled from them while they
were living necessarily Its hard to tell
 So what are you guys doing
 Okay roll a perception check for Frumpkin
 Okay Frumpkin goes up to the doorway and
looks It is a dark hallway no light Frumpkin
sees a little bit of light but its above like
there seems to be an incline Its above and to
the right Its not a straight narrow hall It
seems a little oddly angled
 The light source on the staff now emanates
and the chamber is lit well
 This is open on this side

 I got to use that piece finally
 Okay so Twiggy leaves the radius and starts
heading towards the far end of the room
 All right roll a stealth check
 Good to know What are the rest of you
doing You watch as Twiggy just leaves and starts
heading towards the door
 All right As everyone finds their way to
the door safely you feel the moment to leave the field
 So the hut vanishes Spells expended
 You guys exit and make your way into the
hallway The hallway itself drops temperature
dramatically Its similar to the space that you
guys were in last time You feel for the edges and
theres no real shape or texture to it Its just
solid It feels almost like stone but not quite
Its hard to place As youre stepping into the
chamber I would say Nott and Fjord you both get
just a hint of vertigo You glance and you take a
step into the hallway and its an incline You
look up and you can see the light Its hard to
make out but you see a faint bit of light at the
end of it maybe a hundred or so feet ahead of
you
 Just like stepping into the room and having
no real idea of where the walls and ceiling and
floor are It just looks like a black shape and
youre feeling some walls but theyre a little
rounded Its a strange aspect to this hallway
 No the floor just seems like a steady
incline
of it
 You see the end of the tunnel but you cant
make out whats on the other side Its too far
 As Caduceus steps in with the staff the
light seems to be crushed down to where you can
see the faint bit of it there but theres
something about this hallway thats swallowing the
light or at least compressing it to where its not
giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it
 Not necessarily but make a perception check
for me
 Make an arcana check
 You cant make out much detail beyond the
end of the hallway You however theres
something about this that feels extraplanar
Meaning the end of this doorway whatevers at the
other end is being tethered by something thats
not really material space You dont know what
distance youre traveling between these two
objects
 Perception check
 No In fact its weird because the doorway
itself is this well carved inlaid beautiful door
As soon as you step into the hallway and look at
the opposite end the hallway is just flush with
the exterior of it and seems to curve out into the
rest of the hallway It seems intentionally placed
to match perfectly but has a natural feel to its
shape Its weird
 Correct
 Right Nothing comes up
 Marching order please
 Whos after Twiggy
 Nott and Twiggy Whos after Nott
 Caleb in the back
 You continue along this hallway walking It
takes you a moment to realize but as youre
moving forward the light seems to turn Like
whatever this source is the light shifts
slightly Like whatever source is there seems to
have some sort of movement As youre paying
attention and the closer you get to it you begin
to see its like a flickering of firelight theres a
flamebased light source within whatever this next
area is but it seems to be rotating You begin to
make out shapes vaguely of things within that
room but its rotating as you walk It takes a
moment for you all to realize that this chamber
youre spiraling around it but theres no change
to your sense of gravity but it a corkscrew
movement
 Eventually you come to the end of the
hallway Inside it appears to be a warm interior
Its a crafted den or study of some kind but the
angle youre at as you come to the end of it is a
heavy steep angle You see all these bookshelves
and a desk across the chamber and there are
candelabras in there theyre all this harsh
angle but theyre not sliding theyre all held
in place by something
 Okay You cast Thaumaturgy no effect
 The flames you see are inside the chamber
and you havent entered the chamber yet The
Thaumaturgy doesnt seem to
the chamber
 No
 Make a perception check
 No movement beyond just the slow movement of
flames
 In the interior of the hallway
 Make a perception check
 Looking around the edge of the hall the
ending you dont see any script or symbols
Looking inside the chamber though as you get
close and peer within this is definitely a study
of some kind There are bookshelves upon
bookshelves that round different areas You can
see a desk on the far end with a chair there You
dont see anybody in it Across from where this
desk is you get close and push and past Twiggy
and Nott to look inside This is a tall chamber
its maybe  or  foot tall Taller almost than
it is wide On the opposite end of the desk above
this large collection of bookshelves there is a
heavy stained glass window thats about  or 
feet tall and about  to  feet wide
 There is no light source behind it You can
see the stained glass and that there are colors to
it but theres nothing behind no daylight to
really make it clear from this distance Youd
have to get closer
this chamber
 Not from where youre standing But you guys
still have not entered the chamber
 So everyone gets plus ten to their stealth
check Id like everyone to roll a stealth check
for me please
 Beau
 Overall pretty good stealth scores You
feel pretty confident that as you one by one enter
the chamber bracing yourself to slide down with
the curved floor and you stumble and trip as you
enter because as soon as you step in your whole
perspective shifts and gravity is as it should be
in that chamber You all step in at an odd angle
and have to catch yourself as you have to reorient
yourself in an instant
 Yes
 As you all step in the chamber let me get a
visual reference

 Pushing into this chamber this door is
already open
 You guys all step into the interior of this
den of some kind
 Its fine
 Theres no fireplace but there are
candelabras throughout the chamber that give a
light source that flickers throughout the
interior This is all bookcases these are
bookcases these are bookcases these are
bookcases this is a closed bookcase Theres a
small desk here and a large desk here and the
stained glass window stands up there
 Once you start all of the flames flicker
brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber
 Thats the door you came through
 Make a perception check You guys entered
from that side
 It looks pretty solid
 This wall here
 Theres a ladder over there as well Looks
like these are all set aside for climbing and
getting higher
 Okay
 No you can see through it It starts maybe
six inches off where that platform starts and then
continues up for the next  or so feet Looking
through it is darkness void a lack of light
The only color youre able to make out is what the
candlelight from the inside of the chamber is
enabling you to see from the inside from this
side
 Okay As you all step into the middle of the
chamber to look at this stained glass window above you
 Over here
 Sure You place yourselves where you want to
be
 As theres more light in the chamber you
can see now above this desk there is a
foottall sixfootwide picture frame In the
picture frame from the side angle it has no
image As you step into the center an image comes
into shape You see a tall ten to foottall
dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a very
thinlygroomed chin beard that falls to a point
three or four inches below its a very succinct
point wearing a red robe with gold trim
 He is wearing a handful of rings on his
hands Billowing sleeves folded across his lap
His eyes are a piercing amberyellow color and
his lip curls ever so slightly into a knowing smile
he
 No
 No Its lap up
 A tall thin man of light brown skin with
long dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a
very thinlygroomed chin beard that falls to a
point about three inches below his chin wearing a
red robe with gold trim with billowing sleeves
that fold across his lap His eyes are a piercing
amber yellow His lips curl ever so slightly into
a knowing smile There you go
 Yeah hes got some intricate rings on his
fingers
 Yes It looks almost the same coloration
the same deep red the same gold trim
 While thats happening the stained glass
window now that you have light thats
illuminating it
 There is no backlight so its just the
light that you have on it right there It shows
clusters of different colored circles and discs
arranged in a strange tethered pattern You see
different colored discs different sizes and
colorations that are laid into this with
fragments of dark blues and grays in between They
are all tethered by these silver threads and
various tangled it looks like a crazed
synesthesia equation if you will Anybody whos
trained in arcana or history go ahead and roll
 Okay This arrangement you begin to make
out is a layout of the planes the transitive
planes of the Ethereal and the Astral between the
realms You see these clouds of gray and light
blue that mingle and create a Venn diagram where
everything overlaps on top of They act as the
threads that hold these things together and
connect them in between The inner planes showing
the elemental chaos where the primordial elements
were ordered into following the Founding of
Exandria You can see where the flaming sphere is
placed here and there is the water and the wind
and the earth That is the scattering of these
inner planes
 The outer planes where the realms where the
divine exist are scattered and connected all
surrounding the Material Plane on the outer side
What you both notice two things are off about
this One theres no Divine Gate shown here In
this whole layout there is no reference Most
maps or sketches or historical designs of this
type of a layout contains the Divine Gate because
that was a major event that happened after the
Calamity and separated all of the gods from the
mortal planes
 You get the sense this was designed before
the Divine Gate was ever created Number two
there is an additional shape Smaller than the
rest A tiny rubylike circle that floats in the
Astral Sea that is not tethered to anything and
seems to not really fit within your understanding
of the cosmos
 Like the same color Like the color of a
ruby
 No its just the same type of material as
everything else Its the glass the windows made
out of
 It looks like its sitting in the center of
the Astral Sea and doesnt have any tethers
Everything else seems to be tethered by these
silver cords almost that puts in this large
tapestry And that is just floating between all
the lines in the middle of the Astral Sea
 You touch it
 You touch it and all of you hear this loud
heavy shattering sound as the window shatters into
a hundred different pieces all of them stopping
about three feet from the window and freezing in
place Fjord standing before it in this void gets
sucked into the darkness and the glass window
closes behind him
 No no one technically was watching
 So what are you guys doing Well get to you
later
 You guys notice him vanish Theres no like
where did Fjord go You heard the wall explode and
him disappear and then it reset itself and
closed
 Okay Calebs heading over to the desk As
youre walking by Caleb there are books and
books on these shelves and you notice that all of
the books have a brass binding around them like a
lock Like a square shaped manacle that is affixed
around it and it looks like all of them are
locked in some way There might be ways to open
it but it looks like whoever left this alone did
not intend for anyone to open it but them
 You guys are over at the opposite end of
this closed thing This also has a brass bar that
is bolted and affixed to the closed cabinet
 All right so make an attempt with
advantage
 You manage to find an area underneath the
bar where theres a button press or symbol and
you get one of the tools underneath push it
inside and turn As you do the bar 
tongue out the side of her mouth and one eye closed
 It appears to be unlocked
 Okay you open the inside of the cabinet
and it is empty
 Okay You put your hands inside the empty
cabinet and it immediately closes on your arms as
teeth suddenly emerge from the sides of the door

 No actually this is an attack on each of
you Oh thats cocked Okay that is  against you
 And that is  against you
 All right Each of you suffer  points of
piercing damage
 Both of you take seven points of piercing
damage but you are both currently grappled as it
is slammed on your arms in a very The Thing kind
of way like when the guys chest opens and
closes Yeah its some John Carpenter It closes
on you and you see on each of the doors where the
striations of the wood are they split and you see
these eyes peek through at you
 Okay All right that Invoke Duplicity
appears Where do you want her to be
 Okay yeah so you guys are both up here
right now
 All right I need you guys to roll
initiative
 Nope
 Okay so  to 
 to 
 All righty
 There you go  to ten
 Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet
 I love saying that Thats an actual phrase
that exists Im so happy Ten to five
 Okay got you Caduceus
 All right
 Twiggy youre up first
possible try to extricate my hands from this Is
it possible
 It is You have to use an action to try and
escape with an ability check You can choose
either acrobatics or athletics
  is enough You manage to wedge your
arm
  and pull out and yeah you manage to
free yourself from its grasp
disengage from it and back up a little bit
 Okay easy enough You manage to back up to
there
 That finishes your go Nott youre up
next
 Two peas in a pod over here
 You manage to pull yourself free of it as
well and back up to this side
 And pull away no worries
 That finishes your go Beau and the cabinet
go at the same time Your dexterity is higher than
the cabinets so you go first Its a cabinet
  Levitz pained  What are
you doing
 All right the cabinet
 Yeah this is full on were talking dark
side of Beauty and the Beast here Just making its
way forward It does notice its an illusion It
just steps through it
 It moves through and its going to attempt
to bite It can bite whoever is adjacent in front
of it As you guys move back its going to try
and open and try and swallow you up into it
 Its going to attempt to lean forward and
pull you into the cabinets mouth Against you
Nott that is Ooh thats a  I dont think
that hits
 No its just a hit
 Yep And against you natural 
 Yeah all right so you suffer
as my reaction or can I use it now
 Youve had your turn since so you have your
reaction back
 Yes you can So it would be  points of
piercing damage which is reduced to eight
however you are swallowed
 So youre inside of it now It scoops you
up It lowers down and slams the cabinet shut as
it pulls back Twiggys legs are kicking there
and like Audrey  it just sucks her inside of the cabinet
 Shes used to this Caleb youre up
 Make an investigation check
 Taking a minute to glance through a couple
of things One you pull open one of the drawers
You see a glass jar about this big that contains
about a hundred or so of these small glass beads
Theres that You go Okay thats that On the
desk itself theres a large vial of ink about
that big Its a heavy vial of ink with this big
red quill placed next to it into a little cap
 The cork that has been removed from the ink
vial is laid there next to it on the table You
see in another cabinet a small porcelain doll
Its made of porcelain and silk Its crafted to
look like a young woman in a very fine blue and
black silk dress The hair is long and silver and
the hair in particular is very realistic
 Thats all you find in the desk
 Thatll put you there
 Im saying youre at the desk to search it
So thats   which puts you there
 That finishes your go Caleb
 Jester youre up
 Go for it
 Yeah you can
 Second level so is that d damage
 Roll to hit first You have to roll a d
and then add your spell attack
 Yes not hard to hit Its a cabinet
  definitely hits Roll damage Since your
illusion is immaterial go ahead
 Youll find out
 Hon hon hon nom nom nom I love me some
gnome flesh
  points of damage
 The burst of necrotic energy slams into it
and the cabinet shakes in place The eyes roll in
pain for a second and they withdraw into the wood
before they pop out once more from the doorways
It seems to chew for a second in anger but it
looks hurt Its not bloodied but that was a
hefty hit Not bad
 That finishes Jesters go Caduceus youre
up
 I got caught up in it
 Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw
 Nope Its not very fast this cabinet
  points of damage You watch this burst of
divine energy around it with this faint aqua glow
to it as it burns around it The area where it
hits you see the wood darken and splinter Its
boxlike shape is beginning to warp and twist a
little bit as its starting to give up a little
bit of its instinctual form Now its looking
hurt
 That finishes your go
 Twiggy Top of your turn First things
first its digesting you
 You take ooh thats  points of acid
damage You are inside of it still
 Id allow it Theres few places as exposed
and vulnerable as the inside of its mouth
and attack it from the inside
 Okay You are restrained so its
disadvantage on the attack but it is also the
inside of its mouth so try it out
Disadvantage is an  plus seven so I think
thats pretty good
  points of damage from the inside as you
jam the dagger up into the top of the cabinet
Its a combination of wood striation and weird
liquid muscle that are pushing against you as its
digesting you You jam upward where you imagine
the head might be As you do you hear 
from the inside It begins shifting and quaking
and the muscles are beginning to spasm It needs
to make a constitution saving throw which it
fails and spits you out You are prone on the
ground adjacent it But it does like throwing
up
like
 It is a coating of semitranslucent film
with a very faint green texture to it But it
mostly looks like spittle a very thick spittle
 Youre covered in it Were talking
Ghostbusters slimer hit covered
the front of my face and throw it on the ground
and growl at the cabinet
 You still have movement
can disengage
 You can Half your movement to get prone if
you want to unless you want to crawl
crawl
 Yeah
 Yeah your call
half so  feet
 You can get under the table if you want
the table I cant hide but Im going to get
under there because its not that smart
 You leave this little trail on the ground as
you get under the table
 You got it Nott youre up first
 It does not count as an ally
 Okay you step away It takes an attack of
opportunity with you Its going to attempt to
bite at you and consume you That is a  to hit
Whats your armor class
 You just manage to duck out of the way as it
slams shut inches from your body
 You are going to attempt to hide over here
or over here
 Oh this way You manage to bonus action
hide All right roll a stealth check
 You feel pretty stealthy
 You feel pretty hidden Just throwing it out
there
 All right so you move back out
 Oh thats right yeah Its fine hes
still hidden
 You do have advantage on the attack since it
did not see you
 Yeah all right
 Roll a d On a one or a two its the
defunct one
 Perfect Well regardless how do you want
to do this
 As it vanishes into its mouth heart the
cabinet closes shut The eyes go wide for a
second and you are waiting for the explosion
like 
 Yeah It goes  and starts sneezing
heavily As its sneezing the wounds that its
taken are causing it to sneeze up its blood It is
leaving puddles on the ground until eventually
the eyes roll back and it falls on the ground
 Its a room filled with books Caleb
 Make a choice
 Make a perception check
 Looking up there behind one of the
cabinets you see a small stack of books that
havent been categorized yet Theyre still locked
with the same bronze binder but it looks like
they were set aside like somebody threw them up
there to get to later
 All over the place
 Up here is where Caduceus is
him
 Yeah go for it Make an investigation
check
 They do not appear to be trapped but they
are definitely locked
 These bronze clasps around their form Is
that for one book
 One book You try and get there and the
lock breaks One of your tools snaps inside
 Theres the second book and the third book
 That book the metal brace opens up and the
book is available to you
 Make a perception check
 Looking around no You see the smooth glass
of different colors and you see the seams that
hold them together where its been sealed You can
see the various colors and shapes around it Nah
Youre panicking a bit
 Thats what Caleb checked earlier
 No ones looked at that necessarily
 Okay You are going to head to that desk
there Okay make an investigation check and
perception check for you
 Oh I see Then make an investigation
check
 Looking around you see amongst all the
books that are latched in theres one big
beautiful red leather book with sapphires
embedded in it along the base Its locked in and
its placed ostentatiously in the center of the
center bookcase right there You dont catch any
other hidden chambers but that stands out
 You checking the desk it is locked It is
arcane locked
 You look it Youre like This is not
moving Youre not sure if its trapped
necessarily But glancing at it youre like
This is locked and its locked in a way where
youre not entirely certain You could try but
its going to be a very hard lock
 Go for it
  Total of
  Its not budging
 Interestingly enough the books titles are
not visible They are blank and then once the
binding comes off the title appears on the front
Forum of Zeidel
 That one comes off This one no title
appears You see instead a burn mark appear on the
front like its singed
 Okay youre watching them come over with
these two books and they put them on the table in
the center
 Which book do you open
 Okay As it opens up the pages pull open
and come to rest Nothing happens
 Its a book You can see there is a place on
the inside where a name might have been placed
but that also has been burned off You can see
from the way it opened up there are a few pages
torn out It looks to be maybe a hundred or so
pages
 Its investigation
 Sure If youre helping him out yeah Roll
again
 Its hard to say Its definitely a very
pretty book Its trying to get your attention by
the way its designed and placed
 Make a perception check Caleb
 Youre paying attention to this layout They
open up this book on the table and you glance
over at it You look back and you look back at
the book Those are spell equations
 The one that they just opened on the table
 The burned one
 Touch the one thats open Okay You touch
it Its a regular book
 Make an investigation check Beau Since
Jesters helping you at this point you can do it
with advantage because you guys are both glancing
at what to do
 Skimming over it you actually wait for a
moment where Caduceus is walking and the light
hits it You can see a point on the glass where
you can just make out the faint dimming of the
fingerprint left by Fjord In a very Sherlock
Holmes moment you see the one moment across the
glass where its not quite as shiny and its that
single bit of red thats imbedded in the glass
 Technically it has to be something you
touch So you can put it on the glass
 Light as a cantrip is a touch spell
 Okay As the globs appear on the opposite
end theyre snuffed out
 Make an intelligence check Caleb
 The void the vacuous darkness behind this
reminds you very closely to the hallway that you
traveled in here on
 Okay You can go ahead and cork the ink and
take it with you
 Okay
 All righty Double checking here
 You cast Dispel Magic Theres a release of
arcane energy across it sorry the divine
energy You see the sparkles slowly fade as your
concentration ends
 Okay Its not locked anymore
 Its a  Its one of those roll
tops that slides up
 Okay As this is happening the glass
shatters You watch as both Beau and Jester get
pulled in
 It closes back behind them
  Twiggys gone
 Half your party is now gone Who knows
where What are you doing
 Okay Its empty
 All right You guys go back up
 Okay You stay behind Caduceus same thing

shatters pulls him in and then closes and
reforms itself
 These books as you pull theyre stuck in
the shelf It seems like the mechanism has locked
them into place
 This is to unlock This is your thieves
tools
 The book comes free
  Its not moving Its not
budging
 The second one comes free
 As hes moving up there Theres a bunch of
center row with the big shiny book theres the
top row with the other books
 You go and pull Theyre in place Theyre
not loose
 Okay Doesnt work Doesnt come free
 All right You press the button
  Closes behind
 Ill move this out of the way
 So Fjord The sensation of being rapidly
thrust through darkness at a breakneck speed is
tough on you for the moment that its there Your
sense of physicality is stretched for just an
instant infinitely A point of light rapidly
growing towards you until youre pushed through a
circular portal of some kind Youre falling
Youre falling forward Gravity is pulling you
this direction Make an acrobatics check for me
 You fall  feet Oh not too bad You
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you
slam down onto a circular stone dais Its rising
out of the middle of this chamber about two feet
up You slam into it get up Theres a smattering
of bone fragments across this platform and the
floor around it Bone fragments bones You look
around you and youre standing in the center of an
arrowshaped chamber It pulls back a little bit
behind you but to the backright of you there is
a long hallway that goes into darkness that way
To the backleft of you theres another hallway
that goes into darkness behind you In front of
you the chamber continues on for about another 
or so feet Theres a dead end It curves to a
dead end and there is a pedestal in shadow with an
orb there set onto this pedestal Before it sits
more corpse fragments surrounding glittering coins
and jewels lots of jewels and gems what little
bit of low light in here is catching them What
little bit of light there is its just the dull
blue light You can look up and the portal that
you fell through is this faint blue sparkling loop
that is the only light source in here The rest of
its through your darkvision You can just see the
faint flicker of it reflect and refract through
these scattered gemstones amongst this pile and a
curled mass of deep cerulean blue scales You hear
a heavy snort from under a large rigid horn as a
pair of pale blue eyes open and focus onto you
the body of the large creature remaining at rest
while its folded wings twitch Powerful but
surprisingly slender this young blue dragon lifts
its head to address you
  The smell of unfamiliar sneak
thieves finds us The way is shut to you
 That you have
 Youre not entirely certain where the pile
of loot and the creatures body really begins
Its partially submerged into this nest that its
burrowed itself into Besides from its neck that
slowly begins to extend as its head lifts to meet
your height you cant really see the rest of it
It looks you over its eyes taking in your shape
Wheres the fun in that Why are you here little morsel
 Oh please
 And what have we learned
 Good Tell me what else have those grubby
hands touched I like to know the flavors to expect
 The falchion appears At which point the
head curls back and one of the arms 
You hear coins scatter as the impact sends bits of
its loot across the stone floor and into the
shadows around Ah Its been a while since my
food has played back
 Okay As soon as you turn you hear another
 as the other arm impacts The ground
shakes a little beneath you Make a perception
check with disadvantage because youre scared as shit
 You cant even focus Your eyes blur for a
moment
 It stands there and goes Halas has not
returned in an age You shall keep me entertained
for now
 Make a persuasion check
 Still standing you glance over your
shoulder and you can see now its form Its maybe
from wing tip to wing tip about  or so feet
The body itself is not incredibly massive This is
a younger dragon but its still a fucking
dragon
 It turns its head curiously towards you and
breathes As it does you watch these crackling
blue bolts between its teeth arcing between the
jaws It opens up slightly the tongue running
itself over the front I dont know where he
walks these days Its been a while but we have
an arrangement
 Yes I keep watch on some of his
surroundings and he sends me food and gifts One
day Ill be big enough to eat him and this will
all be mine But until then Im fine with the flattery
 He leaves little pockets around the
world
 He thinks for a second to himself Time
does move strangely chamber to chamber here If he
is well I guess that makes me lord of the
manor
 You hear another 
 More or less  If you can call
the hundred or so chambers here a house
 Make a persuasion check Roll fucking high
 He goes Huh I appreciate the offer but I
tend to work solo and lets be honest Im
hungry There are a few flashes from the center
of the above hallway as a few bodies fall through
Beau and Jester both come falling through Bill
and Ted style Both of you guys make acrobatics
checks for me
 You threepoint land
 You threepoint land 

 Five point of bludgeoning damage to you As
you land the dragon rears up caught off guard
wings up in the air Im going to pull the map
out

 For this Jester landed there Fjord
sorry Beau is prone there
 And the dragon is right there
 Well lets roll initiative first
 Rolled really shitty initiative
 Yeah He rolled a two  to 
 Yeah only those present  to 
 Six for Jester
 Top of the round Fjord youre up Looking
down at the end of this chamber its dark
Theres no light source but you have darkvision
To perceive anything in there you have to make an
action but its up to you So your choice right
now is focus on the dragon or explore your surroundings
 Okay Over there were going to throw the
Is Blink concentration
 Correct So youre not even concentrating
All right cool So you cast Blink on yourself
 As you cast on yourself and turn around
releasing your hand towards it the shadows from
the nearby area cling to it like chunks of a
venomous symbiote for a second As they grind into
the corners of where its body is the curse takes
effect
 Thats the end of your turn so I think you
get to roll right
 Correct but at the end of each of your
turns
 On  or higher you vanish from the current
plane Thats where you were You disappear That
ends your go Beau youre up Youre on the
ground Looking around theres a dragon there
Fjord turns this way and vanishes Theres two of
these darkened hallways What are you doing
 Red elemental gem A fire elemental is
summoned as if you cast the Conjure Elemental
spell and the gems magic is lost So as you
throw it it shatters I dont have a fire
elemental thing on me so well use this for the
time being As you throw it it breaks on the
ground there Suddenly rising from the impact
the flames swirl and build up into a fullfledged
fire elemental beneath
 As for the Conjure Elemental spell lets
see if it gets its action right now
 Yeah it is concentration so youre
considered concentrating right now Its friendly
to you and your companions Roll initiative for
the elemental
 Do you have stats for the elemental
 Its okay Ill find it right now for you
and Ill text it to you
 Yeah do that Pull up the fire elemental
there Initiative whats the number on there
 You got it Thats your action Your
movement Youre still prone
 Okay Half your movement
 You got it Okay That ends your turn The
fire elementals turn now It goes It is next in
the initiative order
 Go for it
 Its still on the ground The mini has it
flying up but it hasnt risen yet
  just hits
 Correct Does it catch fire
 Okay thats the end of the fire elementals
turn Is it going to stay there or going to move
 Jester youre up
 Okay You are now concentrating on Spirit
Guardians Its a wisdom save for the dragon Is
it friendly Oh look at that Thank you for
pulling that out for me Even better
 Youre amazing Thats a wisdom saving
throw right
 It rolled a natural  plus one so 
 It takes half damage though
 You do
 Thats what I thought it was
 Wait An affected creature no its when
it start its turn Youre right Well come back to it
 Okay Which direction
 No its an action unfortunately Only Beau
gets to do that because shes a cool monk
 Okay That ends your go
 Well the dragon is going to take its turn
The dragon is going to turn this way as it moves
around the fire elemental that struck it First
it takes d damage right from being on fire
 d damage Roll a d
 Eight points of damage Insolent
creatures  Turns around on the fire
elemental and releases this burst of electrical
energy This lightning bolt arcs from the front of
its snout or channeled the horn through the fire
elemental and towards Beau
 Spirit Guardians
 Correct so youre too far away from it So
it doesnt take any damage Patient Defense
doesnt do anything You have to make a dexterity
saving throw and the fire elemental does as well
 Thats a success Roll for the fire
elemental
 Evasion happens oh yeah so you take no
damage
 You take no damage Roll a dexterity saving
throw for the fire elemental You duck out of the
way It strikes the wall the stone exploding from
the impact
 The fire elemental takes  points of
lightning damage
 Correct
  damage No Im sorry 
 Its going to then fly back around to get a
better area This is actually going to take up in
the air
 The ceiling is  feet so it gets to max at
the very top Its ten feet above anybody so its
out of melee range unless somebody can get to the
top
 Its  feet Its right there
 The mini looks like its flying when its
not Now its flying Its at the base level
 The fire elemental does get an attack of
opportunity as it moves out of its range
Shrugs it off
  just misses
 It does hit Roll damage
 The flames are burning around its body It
doesnt even pay attention
 Ten damage Not bad Thats top of the
round so  Next up I
believe was it Caduceus first
you
 In the same round
 Yeah so well say both of you guys drop
Both of you roll initiative First of all
acrobatics check
 Yeah you read some books
 Okay  Youre fine
  You both are fine so you land You
actually fall past the dragon 
 You land on the ground like What wings
flapping Theres a fire elemental burning over
here on the side Its absolute chaos Both of you
guys now roll initiative See where you end
up on the initiative order
  Caduceus is up first
 And  So top of the round Caduceus
youre up first Fjord is nowhere to be seen You
can see this giant shadowy mark on the stone where
electricity is dissipating and Beau looks like she
just saw a ghost maybe shit herself
 Just the look Im not saying you did but
you have the look Jester is surrounded by
sparkling unicorns and is just like Uh What
are you doing
 Okay
 Saving throw is
 Charisma Plus three Thats a ten It
fails
 So that now has Bane on it Boop All the
circles
 Correct
 Bane on that Ill make that a yellow one
There we go
 Negative d to all its attacks and saving
throws So you cast that and then you have your
movement and bonus
 Nope nope nope
  Where has Fjord the cowboy gone
 Towards Jester
 This one or this one
 Okay so  
 It is dark in this hallway Theres no light
source so just be aware That ends your turn
Fjord youre going to appear ten feet from where
you were
 You appear there
 You rush up to the very end and you come
upon a small alcove and a small crystal a faint
turquoise greenblue coloration to it Similar to
the flash that consumed the room when the sphere
was being puzzled There looks to be a groove
running across and down the base of it and across
the floor and you glance over and theres a
groove running all the way down the hallway across
the floor
 The crystal is dull It is dark and it is
just there
 All righty Roll for an attack twice
  hits
 Both hit Roll damage
 Nice
 As you peer and run down the side turning
around and firing these bolts out they light up
the hallway as they arc past blasting into the
side of the scaled armor as they both hit The
blasts hit and take damage but its a dragon It
looks over I see you morsel
 It flickers in and out and youre still
standing there
 You added your curse damage on that right
 You add your curse damage
 That ends your turn Fjord Beauregard
youre up
 
 You get there You see this small alcove
with a greenblue crystal thats resting there
and a groove thats running along the ground and
across the wall and continues all the way down the
length of the hall You turn around and can see
that both of them meet in the center and then go
in towards the platform in the middle
 This was the raised pedestal you saw behind
the dragon You guys havent even looked at that
yet because you just saw a dragon and fucking
ran
 Okay You touch the crystal Its cold
 No
 Okay
 Nothing
 
 All right Youre underneath the dragon now
feeling the wind blowing down from the wings
scattering dust and bone pieces around Youre
having to squint your eyes from the bit of debris
thats being kicked up from its wings
 That finishes Beaus go Twiggy youre up
You see Beau vanish down and come back Fucking
crystals right
this line I cant see that its him though
 At this distance You have darkvision 
feet right
 You can see him down there
conceivable that hes fairly distracted with this
and hes not paying that much attention to me
 Its conceivable Youre a tiny little
thing
 That hasnt done anything yet
hide from his sight That hides me so I use my
bonus action to just get hidden a little bit Is
there anything I can
 Unfortunately you are next to a very bright
fire elemental that is lighting up the area You
might have to creatively use the space There are
outcroppings
 Youd have to move into another area to try
and get
its up right
 Correct
attempt to hide in the alcove
 Okay you are small
 See if you can try it Its going to have a
higher DC
 You may or may not be
conjure back into my imagination I remember that
portrait that was up above the desk in the other
bring my hand down through the top of my body and
I make myself look like that portrait of who we
think is Halas Now Im only a foot taller than
myself So Im a four and a halffoot tall Halas
But I have a lot of presence okay
 Make a deception check
 Yeah youre playing it Youre owning it as
you stroll forward creepy extended fingers and
flapping
 And just looks right back at Fjord Its
paying about as much attention to you as it did
when you arrived So you havent angered it
 But it doesnt seem to be convinced
necessarily Unfortunately Dragons are pretty
perceptive Good call though That ends your
turn Fire elementals go
 But can it fly
 Its out of range unfortunately
  There you go Does it stay put or
move anywhere
 Sure He can ready his attack in case the
dragon comes in range
 You got it That ends its go Jester youre
up
 Just fill the chamber with Halases
 Okay whats the saving throw on that
 And a negative d to that
He rolled a  minus three

 What do you Polymorph the dragon into
 Okay just so youre aware roll an
intelligence check for me real fast
 Okay gotcha It turns into this tiny
crimson weasel I dont have a mini for that necessarily
 Here well go there Thatll work
 It falls down ten feet
 It takes one point of damage Its still in
its form but the fire elemental is in range and
is readying its attack so fire elemental attacks
it
 As the elemental slams the tiny weasel the
weasel reverts to the dragon form
 Yeah not the player Well no Ill let you
guys do all of your attacks but Ill let the
enemies do it too
 All right roll damage
 Its okay Thats the thing you have to
consider with Polymorph You have to decide if
its going to take damage if youre going to put
it in a tiny form
 Its all good
  points of damage That was an awesome
maneuver
 Yeah its all good That finishes your go
Jester Its now the dragons turn
 You want to back up This way
 Spiritual Guardians has faded because you
cast Polymorph So youre backing up this way
 It is Its in range now Now its his turn
It takes fire damage at the top Roll a d for
the fire damage
 Six points of fire damage All right Im
going to roll and see Yeah thats a six It gets
its lightning breath back Infuriated by the fact
that you just turned it into a tiny little weasel
its going to turn this way and release another
arc of lightning down I need both Beauregard and
Jester to make dexterity saving throws please
 Yeah evasions just an ability you have
 All right thats half
 Its  points of lightning damage You
succeeded so its halved You take  and you succeeded
 So you take none
 So you cast Hellish Rebuke
 Nothing comes out The ice gathers around
you and then rockets behind you No effect
 You turn around and look at the crystal and
the crystal is now glowing The light that
emanates from the bluegreen crystal travels down
and arcs through the hallway hits the center and
gives a faint line towards this object across the
way Twiggy and Beau you guys can see as it hits
the center this very faint trickle of energy is
now hitting this far pillar where the darkened
sphere is standing
 That finishes well the dragons going to
try and fly up again
 Both of you do You and the fire elemental
do
 I know
 Whatd you roll
 A four Yeah so it gets out of your reach
Miss The fire elemental does get another attack
as well
 Roll critical damage for the fire elemental
The dragon however does still manage to get out
of melee range and get itself up in the air
  damage Okay
 Correct With the rest of its ten feet up
its going  The dragon is now currently
hovering over
 Yeah well say its there The dragon
seeing the glyphs light up is now turning
 Yeah it just finished its turn blasting and
uses its movement to move up
 Thats true You get another ten fire
damage
 Got it That finishes that round Next
round top of it we have no because you guys
came in last round
 Nott and Caleb you guys have a few more
rounds You dillydallied back there
 You guys are looking through books right
now
 The elemental went after Twiggy It already
went It held its action remember
 Caduceus Youre up
 Correct You are no longer invisible
 You saw none of this You were over here in
this chamber All you saw was a blue thing go
 Thats all you know
 You saw lightning go down there You heard a
scream You saw a blue glow  up the
 Which one
 Okay You release Sacred Flame The flame
burns up around it dissipates No effect
 Okay Brings us to Fjord
 Mmhmm
 I mean if you want to try it
 Okay All the moisture in the air gets
pulled in and clings itself to the outside of
Fjord as this icy encased chunk of arcane armor
that gives off this mist around his torso
 Yeah sure It creates this banded partial
helmet and you crack into the crystal The armor
shatters off of you and into the crystal The
crystal glows Youre a bit dazed by it but the
light tears down to the center of the chamber The
light actually brightens in the center and there
the central orb thats there thats been dark
suddenly lights up with the same dull bluegreen
glow as the coloration on the floor and the
coloration that you noticed very faintly coming
from the inside of the orb when you initially were
inspecting it
 Every turn you have to keep doing it
 You can end the spell prematurely if you
want to
 God Why wont it happen Okay that ends
Fjords go Beau youre up
 Okay so you walk up there you look down
Its just a large pillar with intricate carvings
and you see runes along the side that are
darkened There is a sphere about that big that
looks similar in size to the one the got you here
but its not as intricate Its more of a metal
ball that has hollow runes carved in it that the
glowing bluegreen light is emanating from Its
lighting it from underneath the faint glow and
its lightning the middle of this small alcove
 Yeah that was just your movement
 Sure You reach out and touch the sphere
 Beaus gone
 Thats your turn Twiggy youre up
 The fire elemental right now is no longer
under Beaus control The thread has been severed
that was keeping it controlled as an elemental
 Yep for the next hour the elemental is
considered an enemy
 What are you doing Twiggy Theres Jester
currently now pinned in the back of this hallway
by a dragon flying in the air Its about ten feet
above it
 You are
 You are now within its melee range because
you are now considered an enemy It was originally
whirling there and then all the sudden as Beau
disappears it 
gum Im going to open it Im going to chew it a
little bit and Im going to take it out and then
I am going to pluck one of my eyelashes and put it
inside the gum and Im going to keep chewing it
and then Im going to blow a bubble and the bubble
is going to get bigger and bigger until its
bigger than me When it pops it covers my whole
body and I disappear So I go invisible
 That is my favorite descriptor of
Invisibility I think Ive ever heard in the
history of my gaming experience
arabic
 That makes me so happy
action
 You do
disengage or can I not
 It still knows youre there It will have
disadvantage on an attack as you move from melee
 Or you could just use bonus action to
disengage
 Or just assume that it might miss up to
you
 Okay
 Okay  Youre right there
 Okay that ends your go That brings us to
the fire elementals turn The fire elemental does
not know where you are Its going to move to the
closest target Its actually going to as part of
its fire form
 The fire elemental is going to move through
both of you As it bursts through you both burst
into flames So both of you are on fire
 It is It is going to attempt to attack each
of you once since youre both within his
attacking Fjord that is a  to hit
 All right You take  points of fire
damage
 The armors gone It was consumed by the
crystal
 That is going to be a  to hit you
Caduceus
 You take seven points sorry ten points of
fire damage Thats going to end its turn Jester
your turn
 Ten points
 Yes Which means at the top of your turns
you take d fire damage unless you use an
action to put it out
 Okay
 Make a concentration check for me
 Its above you it wont get an attack of
opportunity on you
 So youre not going to cast the spell
   You get there Roll a d
 Its your constitution saving throw
 Youre fine
 Youre still there You get there and the
magic just sputters for a second Not going to
save you unfortunately
 Yeah
 Aww All right end of Jesters turn The
dragons turn
 Yes it takes d damage Im going to roll
that Thats a nine All right
 No
 Hes getting close to Youre starting to
see some wear and tear
 Does not get his dragons breath back
 So instead its going to swoop down towards
Jester trying to prevent you from escaping
 So it makes three attacks One with its
bite two with its claws First attack at Jester
Okay thats a  to hit
 Right
 Yeah As it strikes with its claw you pull
your shield up sparks fly off as its claw arcs
across the outside of your shield It strikes with
its other claw Ooh thats a natural  plus
thats  minus one 
 Im pretty sure thats it Yeah so the claw
strike manages As the shield pulls away from the
first hit youre not able to get back quick
enough and the second claw goes right across your
torso for  points of slashing damage
 The bite is going to come after you That is
going to be a  to hit Minus a d Minus four
Its going to be a  to hit
 As it goes to bite towards you its jaws
open you pull back and you instinctively put the
shield up to block it and its mouth comes down on
the shield holding on to it Caduceus in the back
focuses for a second and you watch the jaw weaken
and pull back Readying itself for another strike
That ends its turn That brings us to the top of
the round Caduceus youre up
You guys are looking at books still Im
sorry
 You do You take
 You can spend an action to do so You take
six points of fire damage
 To get there yes
 Well people are in a couple of rough
places and youre still missing Caleb and Nott
Up to you You still have an action to use
 I like dumb
 All right Its not concentration
 Ill allow that
 The flame goes out because theres no air
for it to breathe Do you step into it here
 He Homer Simpsons into the stone wall
 You can use your movement to leave the stone
where you entered it which ends the spell You
dont get to move through the stone
 Its a lieandwait type of spell Like
merge into it and stay there for up to eight
hours and then once you leave it But the fires
out and you have your movement
   Youre in the stone currently in
the wall Got it That ends your turn Caduceus
Fjord youre up
 This is going great guys
 Yep you do You take three points of fire
damage
 Okay so  
 Whatre you doing
 Okay
 Roll two attacks
 Both hit Roll damage
 Nice It gets hit twice Ill say go ahead
and make an intimidation check Just as part of
this attack since this was your intent
 You have the dragons attention He was
slashing into Jester and after that twice in the
side of the head it  back towards you
 You can choose to end the spell
 Thats a good question Lets go ahead and
check It should tell you on the spell
 Ah So no
 That ends Fjords go Beau youre out
Twiggy youre up
advantage
 For an attack you do yes
end my invisibility to do this but I pop back out
of my invisibility and Im going to snipe one at
him with advantage
 Okay go for it Is this with your bow
 That definitely hits and it is sneak attack
because he doesnt see you
 You appear in that space and you let loose
an arrow that sinks itself right into the heart
and scaled underhide of the blue dragon
initial hit and then my sneak seven and ten So
 additionally to the ten So  points of
damage
  points of damage Its looking hurt You
can see blood emitting from some of its wounds
to hide behind the pedestal
 Okay so you move behind the pedestal
 You believe that you are hidden
 Fire elementals turn It goes this way Im
going to go ahead and Jester Roll a d On a
one two three it attacks you On a four five
six it attacks the dragon
 It comes over to this side It moves into
this tiny space because it can Its going to run
past It is going to ignite you both as it runs
through So you are on fire The dragons still on
fire But it doesnt lay into you with two
attacks It attacks the dragon twice That is a
natural  and a five Miss  plus three 
points of damage on that crit Nice Not bad All
right that ends the fire elementals turn
Jester your turn First at the top of your turn
you take six points of fire damage
 Youre burning What are you doing
 What are you doing Jester
 Roll your attack
 You spin around The flames are burning
around you You spin to look at the dragon and the
fear wells up inside you facing it down Even
with the flames burning around it you can see its
face coming through towards you angry Now that
Fjords vanished and is no longer in its sight
its turned its attention back to you You think
you reach out for it and expend the spell and
youre just a few inches short
 Okay So youre ending your turn there
youre not going to move
 Thats true
 The dragons turn Top of its turn it does
get its breath back It rolled a six It comes
through the hallway angrily
 It does So Ill roll the attack for the
elemental Another natural  Holy shit This is
the luckiest damn elemental in the world Thats
 plus three another  points of damage
 The dragon also takes because its still on
fire an additional six points of damage Its
looking hurt
 Im going to see if it rolls high enough
perception to see you Natural  It comes in the
chamber   This beam of
vibrant blue electrical energy arcs towards you
Make a dexterity saving throw
 Correct

 It just barely skims singeing the edges of
the branches that are sticking out of your hair
The rats nest themselves curling back from the
momentary heat as the flash of energy but you
avoid it entirely Slams into the wall behind you
Stone breaks and splinters and the energy
dissipates throughout the area No damage Rogues
and evasion man
 It looks furious  The breath
itself it smells like burnt ozone
its not concentration
 Thats true yeah
 Its really confused by it That ends its
turn Top of the round
 Ah
 Go ahead and make acrobatics checks you
guys
 Acrobatics check
 You both fall prone right on the sides of it
as you slam into the dragon onto the side
 on the ground
 Not for dragon scales unfortunately but
you do both take five points of bludgeoning damage
from the impact
 Youre like  Both roll
initiative to see where you fall on the initiative order
 Eight Okay
 Youre in a chamber You land there and you
see this angry burning dragon and this tiny
little version of the mage that you walked through
the den of and thats it You see the glowing
sphere here on the pedestal these lines of energy
that meet in the center The fire elemental in the
back way burning Youre Troy in Community
walking in with the pizzas
 You do smell the electrical remainder in the
air
 Caduceus youre up
 They already rolled initiative
catch it You rolled badly Oh no
 Okay
 What are you doing Caduceus You shout that
as youre stepping out of the wall Were
running its bad
 Youre on deck Fjord
 What are you doing
 Its all good
 All right Whats the saving throw on it
 Okay Is Blindness concentration
 It would be a three plus four its a plus
four con save so its a  minus four from the
Bane so its  Yeah its blind
 You move up The Bane fades
 All right that ends Caduceus turn Fjord
youre up
 So there All righty
 He has reach with his bite He has that
entire hallway covered
 That will put you at  right there
 Fjord is out At the top of your turn
because youre still on fire you do take four
points of fire damage
 Thats the end of Fjords turn Its your
turn
little Halas but as Twiggy I reach in my pouch
again and pull out the tongue of a snake As I do
that I have in my palm a little bit of oil and I
run it back and forth on it Then I throw it out
weve left I try Suggestion
 Wisdom saving throw No thats cocked Its
a  unfortunately Good try
ground
  The dragon hears you speaking
and looks in your direction But where the pale
blue piercing eyes were is just a cloud of black
It is trying to sniff for where you might be
hidden I dont need to hide again if its
already blind
 In theory yes
me
 Yes it does not have tremorsense
 It does have blindsight to  feet I just
noticed
Thats really good That is a  But before I
sphere
 You stay hidden
 Okay you got it You move into the back
area
 Got it Okay that ends Twiggys turn Fire
elemental
 Its going to Nott roll a d On a one to
three it attacks you On a four to six it
attacks the dragon
 Yeah With advantage because youre on the
ground That is a 
 And a 
 Yeah they both hit You take eight points
of fire damage and youre on fire
 Okay so you take four points of fire
damage The second attack does nine points of fire
damage to you That ends the fire elementals
turn Nott youre up
 Hes within five feet of all of you
 Its a sneak attack Just letting you know
its an explosive arrow and youre adjacent to
the creature
 Go for it
  just hits
 Youre prone so you have disadvantage on
attack rolls by the way So you do have to roll again
 Well say you stand up Thats half your
movement there
 The arrow detonates from inside creating a
fiery explosion in a tenfoot radius around the
creature that affects you Caleb and the fire
elemental The fire elemental is immune to fire
it takes no damage The dragon however will you
roll d
 It has to make a dexterity saving throw
Actually it does not because it was hit by it
 It takes an additional  points of fire
damage Then I need both Caleb and you to roll
dexterity saving throws
 So you take  points of fire damage
 You take none because of your evasion You
roll out of the way  Calebs
like Ah
 Still alive
 Correct You still have a bonus action and
half your movement
 Okay go for it
 So
 You have to make an attack roll against
yourself dont you For your weapon
 As you go to fire a second round you pull
back and shoot and the mechanism misfires slightly
and all of a sudden it scrapes you on the side of
the cheek and youre like Ah
 Okay You still have your movement if you
wanted to move
 I mean you can still move within its melee
if you wanted to try and remaneuver
 Okay There you go The fire guy does get an
attack against you
 That is a  I dont think that hits you
 You just manage to avoid it Okay Caleb
youre up
 Yep
 Yeah
 Mmhmm A dragon that looks hurt but not
deaths door
 And a fire elemental that is burning
angrily
 Good call Okay
 All right
 All right That brings us to Jesters turn
 Jester
 Ten feet Thats right
 Unfortunately no Hes placed in a way
where I mean you can You can go oh god
 You can go there That way the fire
elemental is not within range and technically the
dragon youre just out of the dragons range
although youre going to pass it running
 You also take one point of fire damage at
the top of the round because youre still on fire
 Okay I mean theres no way to
 Yeah so   you can get to
 Roll for your d
 Jester remains Its now the dragons turn
 It does not regain his lightning breath
Thats good Hes going to go ahead and take three attacks
 He has blindsight within  feet
 Yeah Thats going to beall right Yeah
its going to be a claw attack on each of you A
claw attack against Nott Thats going to be an
eight plus nine 
 You take ten points of slashing damage
 Got that okay Against Jester that is a
natural four plus nine that is a  to hit
 You deflect it and it doesnt care much for
Nott necessarily Youve been a threat its going
to go after you Jester Im sorry
 Natural two Not even joking I was looking
at it were not out of the woods yet As it
strikes both towards you theres that moment of
quiet where your eyes close and youre waiting for
the imminent moment and you hear this voice creep
in your head and go Dont worry Im watching
Your arm without even noticing you feel a hand
push your wrist and the shield goes up and
deflects the impact The teeth streak across it
and cling to it and begin to try to pull the
shield away and you instinctually muscle it away
As you do you watch two teeth shatter and fall to
the ground in front that moment of strength
billowing up inside a pretty strong cleric Thats
the end of the dragons turn Caduceus is done
Fjord is done and Twiggy
 This is the turn this is the moment
 Its looking pretty hurt Thats as much as
I can tell you
 Yes
and I shoot my arrow
 That hits roll damage With sneak attack
 Into its throat You watch it reach up and
with its claw scrape the arrow out of the throat
and as it does you see a little bit of electricity
arc out from the wound Its looking pretty hurt
attempt to hide again  plus seven
 You stealth into your old campaign That
ends your turn Twiggy The fire elementals turn
First the fire elemental is going to roll against
the dragon which is the closest enemy currently
Natural two thats a miss Natural eight Yeah
it misses both strikes Its going to shift around
to this way That ends his turn Nott youre up
At the beginning of your turn you take six points
of fire damage
 Within  feet he can see through
blindness
 Correct its Notts turn
 Okay Are you disengaging
 Okay
 Going to run to the front it makes an
attack of opportunity against you Thats going to
hit Thats a  plus nine yeah its  Its
going to be a bite attack against you which does
more damage Thats going to be  points of
piercing damage
 The jaws bite into you and you feel it rake
across your shoulder but you manage to pull out
roll on the ground to back up and you manage to
get your arm up and pull yourself onto the
platform where the orb is still glowing that dull
green color
 Go for it
 The bolt ricochets off of the hard scales of
the dragons hide
 What are you doing man
 All right Jesters turn At the beginning
of your turn you take fire damage Six points of
fire damage
 He did Jesters out

 The dragon takes another six points from the
fire The dragons hurt real bad
 The dragons hurt real bad Thats going to
end its turn everyone else goes by Twiggy

 You go before the elemental
out of hiding Im going to fire an arrow with advantage
 Go for it
 Roll damage Well see if its enough
 Okay nine plus four so 
d before so thats for the hit but I get d
on my sneak
 You can either just roll the sneak attack
and then double the number or roll twice as many
dice its up to you
 How do you want to do this

 Quiet shh
that I learned from Sir Cadigan and
 Still in the form
Come straight forward and I want to hit him in
the heart because he broke my heart
  It stumbles
forward towards you now that youre visible its
eyes blinking in and out looking confused still
with the shape and goes
  And falls to the
ground and collapses exhaling bits of energy arc
out of its snout and dissipate into the stone
around there The dragon is dead
right
 Yup 
 You can but its either that or touch the
sphere

 They did Theyre scattered over in this
corner Itd be a move grab it and then go
 Okay 
 As you all one by one emerge beaten on
fire
 Help put it out for those who are still
burning in flames you find yourselves back in the
hull of the ship You see the crew half of the
crew is sitting there looking intense the sphere
resting on the center of one of the tables off to
the side and as soon as the first of you emerge
theyre like  Where have you been
Whats going on Orly pushes forward and goes
Where all you been hanging  A few
more appear  Eventually everyone makes
their way out of the sphere
all by myself
 You hear a clattering sound and you glance
down and you see stuck in the side of your boot
what looks like one of the errant dragon tooths

 Marius is like Weve been waiting here for
seven days
 Yeah
 Were at Bisaft Our repairs finished like
a day ago and we havent paid yet because youve
been fucking gone The Dockmasters not happy
 Yeah its sitting on a table Theyve all
been rallied around it trying to figure out You
guys vanished and this was all that was left
 We figured that was the case
 All right its about  gold for the
masts getting the various bits of the sails
repaired and fixed and everything
 All right Ill get them paid Mark down
that amount
 You watch her gnomish form vanish off the
docks and mingle with the rest of the villagers of Bisaft
 You both quietly sit there drinking your
tea finishing off the watch while the rest of
your group sleeps soundly in their midday bunks
recovering from the strenuous activities of
surviving three chambers of a hundredchambered
mage vault extraplanar home Well end it there
and pick up on that next week
 Well done guys holy shit We have this
ridiculous trend of guests killing bosses from the
last campaign
 I like that
 Thank you guys so much for watching Thank
you again Deborah for joining You were such a
joy Was there anything you want to talk about or
plug before we leave
doing a show with Geek  Sundry called Relics and
Rarities and its super silly and fun and great
and I hope that everyone will love it and I just
want to say a big thank you to you guys because I
dont think that would be possible either for me
without all of you paving the way and being so
supportive and so incredible and so inspiring
Thank you so much
 It looks so good
 Thank you guys Have a wonderful night
Well see you next week We love you and is it
Thursday yet Good night
 Welcome back Last we left off The Mighty
Nein had been making their way through the Swavain
Islands in the Lucidian Ocean after vanishing from
the island of Darktow with the damaged
Squalleater renaming it the Balleater
 As you do Managed to escape from the
Divers Grave and the ship graveyard that turned
out to be as well as the entity that lived there
You had acquired another sphere of Ukotoa
 Every time
 Upon making your way to the Bisaft Isle to
get repairs for your ship as it limps along the
ocean you discovered that you had a stowaway who
had followed you on the ship since Darktow The
delightful gnome named Twiggy befriended you and
revealed the item which had sent her on her path
to becoming a stowaway the strange clockwork
arcane sphere that she seemed to have stolen from
an auction house to keep away from a bad man Upon
toying with this sphere you discovered that it
seemed to have some sort of planar elements bits
of conjuration magic to it and was dispensing
coins and cold weather attire A little more
tweaking sent you somewhere else The present
party was transported to some extraplanar
dungeon if you will an abode of a hundred plus
rooms that apparently belonged to a mage from long
ago Upon exploring and making your way through
the various traps and tricks you managed to avoid
a few pitfalls trigger a few others gather a few
objects fight a cabinet find some books and end
up teleported in a scattered fashion into the
realm of a young blue dragon
 Yeah For two of you by the skin of your
fucking teeth you all managed to figure out the
way to trigger the exit and escape in time with
Twiggy dealing a final blow to the dragon on the
way out of which some of you may believe her as
no one was present to watch it happen After
which you made your way you realized youd been
missing for six days that there was some time
dilation between the time you spent in the sphere
or at least within a few chambers in the sphere
versus the time out here The crew had been
waiting for a number of days The repairs had been
completed on Bisaft Isle You guys decided to call
it an evening and rest up lick your wounds and
reflect over what had transpired in the past day
the past week the past month who knows With
most of you going to a rest and Beau and Caduceus
heading up to the top of the ship to calm and
discuss these things you all called it a night
So Mighty Nein as you are still at dock on Bisaft
Isle what would you like to do the following
morning
 Lets say its a long nights sleep because
theres a lot of recovery So Ill say without
any sort of necessary reference to wake you up for
an early point you sleep in till near noon
 The one that says
 This is Lauras dont
fucking touch
LAURA I didnt know there was a donut in there it
just said Dont Touch
 To be fair thats one of the perks of being
an adult
 You know a little bit Youve passed here
once or twice Its the largest of a set of four
parallel islands but for the most part its not
really cultivated The jungles here are fairly
thick The fruit trees and exotic creatures make
it an interesting passby port but also a
dangerous thing to push into The thick mangrove
trees choke most of the coastal areas except for
on the south which is where the actual town of
Bisaft Port is which is where you guys are
currently set You do know that because its
cluttered it tends to be a favorite spot for
contraband out in the jungle but the creatures
that live there are pretty dangerous so most
people avoid that There are some remaining signs
of the KiNau people that used to be indigenous to
these islands before they all became part of the
Clovis Concord Thats about all you know I mean
its a small village maybe  people or so
 Not all of them I think a few of them were
Part of the locking mechanism was embedded in the shelf
 Sure
 Insight sure
 Youve learned enough yes
 You have proficiency bonus Okay so you
guys head back up to the deck and over towards the
dock Couple of things you notice One you
havent really been out of the ship to see the
port By the time you guys returned it was
nighttime and didnt have really a good view as
at night on this island there really isnt a lot
of light it shuts down at dusk
 Bisaft Theres a lot of ships Probably
about  or so Theyre mainly Concord military
vessels similar to the one you saw and avoided on
the outskirts of Nicodranas Glancing over there
are a few groups of soldiers on the docks
stretching Looks like theyre loading supplies
into the ships Theyre making a stop and the
ships are waiting for others to fill up because
its a small dock Its mainly meant to maintain
at most six or seven ships at a time so theyre
having to go in waves to take supplies and theyre
probably cleaning out some of what Bisaft Port has
 Sure yeah Theres a number you can go
ahead and stop Theres one of them nearby that is
sitting there stretching legs and gathering their
supplies in a small sack They probably bought a
few things to take on the path
 Yes we are making our way through the
waters This is just a quick stop
 Well with the recent attacks the war at
the Empire its getting a little hairy so the
Marquis Olesya Lapidus is calling many of the
warships to the southern coast to be a precaution
near the border
  This is a
conflict between them but it is still important
to be careful We have an alliance from a trade
standpoint with the Empire but they are not
entirely the most pleasant people so they can
deal with their problems and if comes to us well
keep it to the shore The good news is as far as
I know Xhorhas isnt a navaloriented people
What I have heard and he leans in a bit is the
underelves apparently snuck past the mountain
range and attacked further inland Felderwin was
assaulted and the fields were set ablaze
 A smart move in cutting the food from the
people eh These beasts are clever Be careful
 Felderwin yes
 I dont think We are running along the
coast and just heading to the southern area south
of the jungles and a little bit past Nicodranas
and keeping a boundary in the waters
 You as well He grabs his stuff and throws
it over his shoulder and heads back to the rest of
the crew
 Apparently set some of the fields ablaze
You passed by Felderwin when you were traveling
both north and south on that road there and its a
heavy source of agriculture In fact it feeds a
lot of the military
 At this point you hear a 
You turn around and you see a human male in his
mids with salt and pepper brown hair with a
thick mustache somewhat stained linen clothing
with a length of rope wrapped over his shoulder
and he goes Hello Im Dockmaster Podderan I was
the one patiently waiting I guess for you all to
return and pay for the good repairs that were
required of my crew So if you want to pay up or
were going to have to keep the Balleater ourselves
 Curious name Balleater by the way
 Reaches into his satchel pulls out a small
leather ledger past a few pages Theres little
counts a couple notes there Tears it out and
hands it to you Its for  gold for full ship repairs
 
 No That pot was taken by Darktow when they
came aboard
 Correct That was the other downside with
Avantika being wrapped up in this whole plot in
Darktow was as soon as she was executed they
commandeered anything that belonged to her crew
and left you guys the ship With the supplies on
cannonballs the gunpowder basic supplies that
were left over for survival and upkeep but
anything of worth was taken by Darktow as their
prize
 Appreciate that All right well whenre
you planning to head off
 Could you leave possibly by end of day
Ill give you back  gold if thats the case I
need to and he looks off towards the ships
that are waiting and goes I kind of need the space
 Make a persuasion check
 He goes Well come find me and he points
over to one of the nicer coastal huts set up right
at the outside of the docks
 Right Turns back and heads off to his
business Various military crews are still running
up and down the docks carrying supplies to and
from What would you guys like to do
 Okay Make a perception check
 The closest place the scent catches your
nose Theres a place called the Bisaft Meadery
 Meadery
 No Its a small open It looks like a
simple tavern but only the back half of it has
walls where its a thatched top There are support
beams and there are a number of tables and stools
set up and a number of mead barrels set up in the
back as well as an open grill made of metal rods
welded over each other and a bunch of wood burning
beneath it Some of the people that live here in
Bisaft that run this meadery are preparing an open
breakfast essentially and a lot of the soldiers
are crowding over and filling up spaces The scent
catches your nose of cooking boar and various
fruits and vegetables that are also being mixed
in giving you this sweet meat scent that hits you
as youre stepping off the dock The closer you
get you realize youve got to get there pretty
quickly because its starting to fill up with a
lot of these soldiers As you get to the food it
smells delicious Its made for a mass meal for
the number of people that are here so this is
their way of preparing as much as they can so
its nothing meticulous Its nothing gourmet
necessarily but it looks delicious and it looks
serviceable
 Yeah due to the nature of this being a
small port and the military that are coming in
through here People live here from all over you
can see a spectrum of skin tones that lead you to
believe that there are people both who come from
the KiNau who are from the island people that
have settled from the Empire folks that have come
from Marquet and come here and even probably is a
few super pale folks here that may have found
their way over from Issylra For the people that
live here its a fairly diverse cultural capital
though a lot of it seems to be mostly ingrained
at least the basis of it in the KiNau people and
the base of a lot of the Menagerie Coast
 Pocket bacon pocket boar
 Well you go ahead and ask Theres maybe
four servers that are running around like crazy
that are in the process of handing things out and
taking stuff but there is one individual you see
this woman in her late s early s Beautiful
brown skin big smile a little heavyset who
seems to be looking over the place like she is the
owner of this meadery Looks over to you and as
your eyes meet notices the look of I need
help and goes over and goes Hello darling
How can I help you
 Well I can help with any of these of
course
 Whats your name
 Beau Well a pleasure to meet you I am
Bentha Tamalos and welcome to my meadery
 Call me Bentha please
 Pleasure to meet you as well darling
Well how many bottles would you like Do you want
to have glasses separately or do you want to just
buy bottles and serve yourselves
 Well its all pretty sweet Its all
brewed here with our islandcultivated honeybees
 I do as well yes
 Mm theyre not immediately local Would
you like a tour of our hives

 I do have to ask unfortunately there is a
tourist price for the tour
 Five silver
 All right The bottles are  gold a piece
You wanted two bottles thatll be  gold and
you wanted how many cups Or do you just want your
bottles
 She looks up at you and goes Do not worry
honey I get you no problem All right Ill
prepare this She does some calculations and
goes All right for all of that together with
your glasses for each of you the meals prepared
for each
 Unfortunately not much of a pastry
opportunity out here on the Swavain
 Her smile maintains but the eyes go hard
But she goes No doughnuts However for
everything involved that would be  gold for all
glasses of mead all food provided
 And five silver for the tour for this blue
young woman over here
 All right The food is presented It smells
wonderful The din is quite loud now as the
various naval officers and naval soldiers of the
Clovis Concord are surrounding the space and
chatting talking about bullshit Some of it is in
Common some of it is not While you guys are
eating your food anything else you want to do
The mead is quite good it is very sweet Even
just finishing one glass youre like Oh this
is dangerous and probably going to give you a
headache if youre not careful What
 Yeah severe Ren faire flashbacks
 As you guys are in the process of eating
your food a recentlyawoken and somewhat
harshlooking morning Yasha wanders over
 Comes by and slips it over
 As you guys are finishing your meal and
Yashas quietly staring into the plate and eating
with a distant intensity like shes prone to
 Make an investigation check
 Okay Magic shops just so you guys are
aware are super rare Theres one in Zadash and
theres maybe one or two in Rexxentrum
 Theres definitely not one here
 Theyre a relatively rare thing But
herbalists are not too hard to find and healing
potions while they can heal the crafting of one
doesnt require massive arcane knowledge Its
through knowledge of medicines and proper brewing
techniques However the army has bought up a lot
There are two regular healing potions you can find
for sale for marked up because youre at sea
 gold apiece
 You can try and haggle if you want to
 Depends on what youre looking for There is
a blacksmith by the name of Keisha Budan who does
most of the metalwork for the ship repairs and
other general goods that require metalwork around
the island
 As you approach the space she has you can
tell from the large smokestack pouring out of the
top of the forge that she keeps but as you
approach you can see a young woman in her late
s or so massive arms her thick black hair
pulled back into a tuft and she has a leather
apron on You can see now a lot of metal
reinforcements used for holding beams together in
shipbuilding and shes laying them out one by one
as she finishes hammering and then quenching and
then hammering and quenching As you walk up she
rubs her brow Can I help you
 I can do my best I dont get many like
your height in here anyway
 At the very least Im looking forward to
sating my curiosity
 She takes it
 This is very good craftsmanship I could
not do this Unfortunately the break is very bad
Do you have the other part of the weapon
 If given maybe a week with the right
materials I could maybe try to work on it but
honestly your best bet is probably to go into the
coast We dont do much in the way of masterwork
weapon craftsmanship here on Bisaft My
apologies
 It has been very busy this past day or
two
 Its a lot of commotion but theyll be
gone soon We get waves of people coming through
 She sits up for a second and looks you over
Can I have a hug

 She goes and takes it and cuddles you
 Yeah
 Thank you Youre quite fuzzy and I was
curious
 Any time Were here on the island Nowhere
else to go
 There are worse places to live Ill tell
you that Have a good day Whats your name
 Caduceus Keisha
 The pleasure was all mine
 You walk away to the sound of  in
the background as she goes back to work
 Because spice trade and various spices
not spice trade here is quite prominent as
well as other such materials in that same avenue
various herbs and compounds used in alchemical and
medicinal purposes yeah you can find incense
here actually Its marked up a little bit
Because its Bisaft and because its a trade post
out in the middle of the ocean the people can
charge a little more and they know they can
Depending on how much incense you want to get
 For a person burning incense in their
house
 Well say about  gold worth which would
cost you  here
 Okay So you take  gold worth but itll
cost you  well say You mark off  gold but
you write down you have  gold worth of incense
 All right The bee tour
 She takes you around behind the meadery
Theres a jungle path that leads through the very
lush green trees and its a very humid day The
morning was a little gray in the sky and it looks
like it might rain in the next few hours or so
She leads you through and is talking about how
many years her family has been running the meadery
and its a wonderful place There isnt much of an
interest in mead out here in the island so she
feels like she cornered the market a bit She has
friends that bring it to the other island towns
and it makes a fair amount of money Shes very
proud of it As shes doing the talk she leads
you around There are a small sect of wooden hive
setups You can hear already as you approach the
slight hum of them Theres a young boy maybe 
or so who is wearing a very thick smock with a
hood who is in the process of scooping out some
of the honey
 Oh well stay here preferably Do not get
close enough to let them sting you and if ones on
you dont freak out and smack it please
 The tour is not intended to bring you that
close
 She looks very confused and goes Okay
 Do you say that
 She goes Well if you want honey I can
get you honey
 Ah
 Misan The little boy goes What Bring
some honeycomb over here for a customer Okay
He cuts a little piece off with a dull knife and
holds it on the edge of the knife and walks over
You see the bees covered up his arm and he puts it
over and hands it to you
 Its gooey Its very sweet and very waxy
 The boy heads back to his work and shes
waving some of the bees away and goes Sure
Lets walk back Ill be happy to sell you a jar
or two How many would you like
 Of course
 Two jars Thatll run you five gold
pieces
 All right She claps her hands together
happily and leads you back telling you more about
the waves of various traders and merchants that
come through Some individuals some names she
throws out that shes met and flirted with and one
that asked her to marry him when she was younger
but she turned him down You have no idea who any
of these people are but you cant help but be
halffascinated because theyre stories You have
two jars of honey plus honeycomb for five gold
 Youre approaching right as theyre about to
leave from the hives
 A fungal bloom you can do with Decompose
Druidcraft would be the creation of flowers unfortunately
  Theyre doing their business
Theyre not paying any attention to you
 In the moorlands they have
 Its a marshland where youre from
 You were given enough supplies for a week or
so off of leaving Darktow and you guys can create
your own food and water Theres enough gunpowder
for a dozen or so volleys of cannon fire
 You can drop a gold piece and be good for
the next two weeks on flavoring the food for you
and the crew
 At this point in the day its starting to
get close to dusk
 Which Caleb during this time
 As youve spent most of the day on the ship
to your own devices what are you doing
 Correct You have four books total I
think
 One thing you notice about the sphere
 its
arrangement is entirely different Remember where
all the places where you had shifted since you had
gotten it from Twiggy Since youve returned its
like an entirely new sphere It has completely
refigured its surface The bands have shifted All
the different places where youd place your
fingers and thumbs to try to move the different
hemispheres are in completely different places It
seems that whatever you triggered to get you to
the internal space and then returned from reset it
in some way The puzzle has started all over
 Thats easy enough to do The jar of beads
 The book
 All right so thats the spell book
 The ink is not normal It is faintly
enchanted specifically for the intent of scribing
magical things For the purposes of scribing
scrolls or scribing spells into spell books the
ink will make up to  gold worth of scribing
You still need paper but essentially any
parchment can be made useful as if was the most
premium of spell craft parchment with that ink
 You have the books too The other books
 One of which after reading through it is
essentially a number of studies on the effects of
alchemical compounds on corrupted plant life
There is one that speaks of public debate records
within the forum of Zeidel regarding the moral
implications of arcane experimentation on
prisoners of Ghor Dranas and warnings of the war
with the gods Its a transcript of a debate
forum All you know about Zeidel make a history
check actually
 From your studies Zeidel was one of a
number of extremely erudite societies in the Age
of Arcanum that had harnessed crystals to make
their city hover aloft There were a handful of
these in the Age of Arcanum that could travel
across Exandria cities that were mobile As far
as anyone knows all of them had been wiped out
during the Calamity Zeidel as far as youve
learned is one of them Thats all you know
 Mmhmm The last one discusses the theories
behind the ice fields and the underreaches of
Eiselcross and the beasts that live and endure
it
 Eiselcross EISELCROSS Eiselcross
you know is a rather large body of land to the
north of the main Wildemount continent Its
considered part of Wildemount overall but its
just a frozen arctic cap
 Its separate The Frozen Depths theres a
large channel of water that separates the main
body of Wildemount and Eiselcross but aside from
two very small ice fishing villages that are
expansions of the Dwendalian Empire it is mostly
uninhabited Nobody really goes there Theres a
bunch of creatures that have spent a millennia or
more living in that place that are extremely
dangerous and its just snow and ice so nobody
goes there
 Cool enough All right
 Eiselcross is far north of that
 Off the map
 You guys manage to make your way back You
manage to recover your  gold from the
dockmaster Podderan You get back to your ship and
you Caleb hear the rest of your party return as
the rest of the crew begins to prepare for setting
sail off the dock
 All right With that as everyone gets
prepared Orly comes out from underneath the deck
and turns to you and goes Captain where about
are we taking off towards
 Its archipelago
 Well go ahead and make sure were heading
that way He turns around to the rest of the
crew begins giving a couple orders heading over
and getting his map out Pull up the anchor and
slowly you guys begin to make your way out onto
the Lucidian Ocean just as the sun begins to set
Now the sky itself has been pretty gray and
cloudy and youve been smelling the coming of
weather No more than  minutes after leaving
the rain begins
 For most of this travel youve kept an
aspect of your consciousness looking out for
errant weather and thereve been a few moments
where some rains have come through that brief
interaction with the Divers Grave in which a
storm was conjured but it didnt have the same
feel that youd been hoping whatever this draw
was that drew you southward and to run into these
friends again at the coast As you begin to push
further and further towards the direction of the
storm theres an excitement in your belly that
you cant describe
 As the rain begins to hit the deck itself
the endless patter of heavy droplets smattering
against the dark wood the winds begin to pick up
a little bit and some of the crew begins to look
off You see Marius glance off and go Captain
should we put up the storm sails The winds
picking up a bit
 It takes them a little bit
 They start diminishing the presence of the
regular sails and getting smaller more durable
sails pulled up in there
 Youre probably helping them with it Its
an all hands on deck thing to get this going
quickly With that they begin to pull the sails
into place The wind immediately picks up again
once the sails are back in and the wind is
starting to pick up a bit heavily You see Orly
glancing over the edge his large shell slick with
rain smattering against the backside of it as he
turns around towards you and looks at you through
the darkness the little bit of light there is
from oil lanterns being held across the deck
Goes Captain I think were heading into a
proper storm
  Captain were heading into
a proper storm
 Smartass
 We can if we take a few more days to
 Aye aye Captain All right everyone All
hands on deck
 As everyone gathers to begin to ford out
into the evening
 Your nerves are slightly set on edge as you
can see the distant flashes of lightning arcing
from storm to ocean the heavy sheets of wind
obscuring most of these bolts With that the rain
gets heavier and heavier I need you as the
captain to roll a survival check for me if you
dont mind Ill give you advantage on this
 Well that adds onto advantage
 Yeah it acts as a luck point It actually
technically is a third die but youve already rolled
 Okay good Keeping it steady in going in
the ships handling it fine The winds are heavy
but the repairs you made thankfully have brought
the Balleater up to a very functional ship The
crew is experienced and now that they seem to be
a little more comfortable under your leadership
and with the help of the rest of the party  you
guys have taken some time at sea to learn a number
of skills that are helpful  your first bit of
evening travel into the storm seems to be going
well It goes on for a few hours The storm
doesnt seem to be getting worse necessarily but
the waves are rocking quite a bit Eventually
into the early hours of the morning sleep is
going to have to come to some of you at the very
least
 So youre going to sleep Whos staying up
for how long to keep watch Or you can leave it to
the crew its up to you Theyre experienced but
youre the captain
 Youre staying up Where are you staying
 At the helm Youre staying there with Orly
Orlys staying with you Anybody else
 Okay Standing at the back of the boat
Everybody else sleeping
 The wood is creaking with each shift of the
boat as the waves climb higher and higher
occasionally slamming into a valley between
 As the rest of you are enduring the chaos of
the rains above keeping focused and keeping it
steady its exhausting both the attention
required for you specifically and the hour being
late Thankfully you slept in so you can go on
for quite some time Yasha where on the ship are
you standing
 The lines seem to be okay Fjords at the
helm with Orly so theyre both towards the back
 Probably closer to the bow or the foremast
 Okay In keeping this going do you head
back up to help Fjord or are you heading to rest
as well
 Its hypnotic the sound of rain and the
movement of the waves and the flashes of light
and the rolling of thunder You grab the edge of
the rail of the bow looking out straight into the
storm that youre passing into Its a blur of
light and movement and darkness The horizon
beyond your vision is obscured it feels like
youre riding this into a tumultuous sky You
begin to fall into a trance your eyes closing for
but a second Were going to take a break
 Well be right back in a few minutes In the
meantime we do have our fantastic Wyrmwood

congratulations Well get that sent to you ASAP
I know there wasnt a single dick joke in that
name Congratulations
 So the rest of you are currently either
focused on helping on the ship itself or are down
below deck resting sleeping or concentrating on
whatever is needed Taliesin Oh youre just
saying youre down there
 Gotcha Its important
 As the sound of the storm and the movement
of the ship begins to lull you into this trance
your lids grow heavier and heavier and as your
fingers tighten and clasp the edge of the bow
your vision goes darkand youre kneeling You
open your eyes and youre cleaning a fox you
hunted and pulled from the nearby brush You look
across the surrounding Iothia Moorland the sheen
of the shallow pools dotting the flat swamp brush
landscape the grays and browns of the valley
beneath the clouded skies that raised you this
is the home you knew The muted colors are
comforting You hear a voice shouted at a
distance Yasha You turn and see the rest of
your hunting party of the Dolorav Tribe Walking
towards you dirty and smiling is Zualla her
leather marked with mud her brown eyes barely
visible under her tangled hair Thats a hearty
fox for one care to share it The warmth in your
chest fills you Theres a flash of lightning
behind you At that instant you see Zualla
fleshless and bone then darkness once more
Another subtle flash but blue and muted Another
A roiling ball of storm clouds grows before you in
this veil of shadow swelling as the interior
sparks and flashes with light intensely and they
occur more and more rapidly as this sphere of
roiling storm grows and swells You sense
something contacting you and while it isnt
speaking with words you interpret it through
language through your mind Loss Loss is
excruciating Loss is paralyzing Loss is
inevitable Loss can bring sorrow bring hate
bring cruelty and darkness Another bright flash
You see a muddied field of burning huts Corpses
lie at your feet your blade bloodied A figure
turns to you eyes aglow with yellow their deep
red skin and hooked horns peeking from beneath
their folded wings Their smile curls open Your
anger is beautiful to behold Orphan Maker
Another flash Only the rolling storm remains
 The thoughts return this voice
coalesces into more of an actual throaty deep
timbre Loss can instead teach you what is
important It offers perspective It offers focus
might the courage to protect what has not yet
been lost To be alone to push others away can
prevent loss but it also prevents growth
strength purpose How much how many will you
lose until you find your strength The thunder
gets louder and louder cutting through the veil
You find your consciousness tug at your mind and
slowly you begin to shake out of this fugue state
the sound of muffled rain once again growing loud
around you the cold sensation of it dripping
through your armor Another crack of thunder As
the dream begins to fade the voice says Show
me Show me what is important what is worth
protecting This storm was birthed only for you
Your eyes flicker wide and youre back on the
edge of the ship The wave hits the bow of the
ship once more You hold tight your hair slicked
down across your face as you look up and with
that a single bolt strikes down slamming into the
front of the ship Where you expect to see
splintered wood and fire instead there is just a
darkened spot the impact muted What you see
of crackling blue energy It stands your height
vaguely humanform shifting with unstable power
Suddenly two vibrant wings of lightning open from
its back like an angel It walks towards you
 Its going to claw across the front of your
body
 All right That is going to be a  to hit
Whats your armor class
 All right
 As it claws across the front of your body
its hand seems to almost pass through the
resistance of the armor for but a minute before
you feel this shock to your system as it arcs
through you feel the lightning pulse through your
body You suffer eight points of bludgeoning
damage plus five points of lightning damage
 You were below deck and there
 Oh youre upstairs You guys watched a bolt
of light strike down towards the ship All you see
is this faint dull glow like a mote of energy
thats rolling around Make a history check
 Yes
 Youve heard tales of something called ball
lightning bits of storm matter that just scatters
across Its usually innocuous and people either
watch it fizzle out or get it thrown overboard It
usually happens in the cusp of a storm and you
watch it dance along the vicinity of Yasha But
thats not what you see I need you to roll
initiative
 All right its going first
 As you reel from it reaching back for your
blade the creature seems to be intent on you its
form seeming to shift and bend with the wind and
the rain Its going to reach out towards you for
two more strikes That is going to be a  to
hit
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 That is going to be five points of
bludgeoning and two points of lightning
 Its your turn
 Your skeletal wings flare out from under
your back your hair blown up from the wind and
the impact of the wings flying out from underneath
the shawl It needs to make a wisdom saving throw
I believe
 That is a six It has no bonus It is afraid
of you for how long
 All righty Does it get to save at the end
of its turn or is it just afraid of you
 Okay got you Oh and then it lasts for a
minute if you do the extra damage Once during
each of your turns you deal extra necrotic damage
to one target when you do damage to it It equals
your level so you do an extra seven points of
necrotic damage once per turn to it Keep that in mind
 Thats the end of the round You guys look
over and watch Yasha at the end this mote of
lightning dancing around her rolling across but
slightly hovering above the surface of the boats
deck Suddenly she unleashes her fallen form the
wings rising up Other members of the crew that
are holding down the ropes see this and take a
step back not entirely familiar with this appearance
 Correct Theyre not frightened of you
Theyre just really spooked by the reveal Its
going to swirl around you suddenly it seems to
move with pulses of energy with an unnatural
speed Whips to the opposite side and it is going
to attempt to try and slash into the lower back
Thats going to be a nine and a  to hit
 Okay Thats going to be eight points of
bludgeoning damage reduced to four because youre
raging plus four points of lightning damage
 Oh Im sorry it has disadvantage on the
attacks I need to roll that other attack again
Okay still hits because its frightened of you
 Its going to attempt all right Its
going to attempt to move away from you
 You can attempt to Ill let you grapple as
a reaction sure
 Its an athletics check for you because
youre raging its at advantage
 Yeah its staying You reach out and your
hand passes partly through it and it goes numb
the field of sparkling energy lightly electrifying
the skin around your hand But you manage to get
hold of something its not solid matter but
something As it tries to move away you keep it
there barred in place That ends its turn its
your go
 Go for it youve got two attacks
 Are you doing this reckless or not
  hits
 Go for it Describe to me your attack As
youre holding it with one hand and pulling the
blade out
 Youre watching her reaching out and
grabbing this small sphere of sparkling energy
She grasps it grabs her blade and strikes
through with both hands arcing downward Because
you do have two hands youd lose the grapple
because it is a twohanded weapon
 But you also have sentinel so if it tries
to get away you can hit it
 Plus the seven once per round  points of
damage
 You have two attacks every turn I know its
been a while
 I know you forgot your sheet
  does not hit
 What was that
 No Im afraid that does not This first
swing strikes through You watch the spark flash
with energy for a second The second swing goes
wide It moves around zigzagging as it curls
around her You want to do anything or just
watching
 Okay so you rush over in the direction of
where she is and this entity
 Back to its turn Right there in front of
you its going to attempt to use Anger of the
Tempest It pulls back from you its no longer
frightened of you It goes from its defensive
position to leaning in towards you It looks up at
the sky and as a moment theres this slight smell
of burnt hair that catches your nose before a bolt
of lightning arcs from the sky and slams into you
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw You
do have advantage on this
  does not make it
 You take  points of lightning damage and
as the bolt hits you your whole upper torso goes
numb Your fingers arent responding and you drop
your sword to the ground The creature bends down
and picks it up and holds it up looking right at
you Doesnt move Your turn
 Not anymore And frightened doesnt force
you to move you just cant get closer
 Its your turn
 You can use an attack to try and disarm it
if youd like
 Okay make another athletics check You have
advantage on it because youre raging
 No It had a plus three and rolled a  so

 As it pulls back attempting to use
Magicians Judge against you you reach forward
and grab it and for a moment youre both
struggling back and forth You manage to rip it
from its hand its fingers actually evaporating as
you rip it from its form and then reform where
they were previously The energys still arcing
around it and it moves around to almost try and
move to your flank but you shift around to face
it You have your other attack if youd like
 You call it at the beginning of your turn
  does not hit Goes wide Unfortunately
your bodys still numb from the impact of the
lightning bolt You reel from it angrily That
finishes your turn
 Do you want to roll to get involved Roll
initiative
 Six Yasha your initiative was
 All right Jester you can go Ill let you
in
 Go for it
 As Jester touches you and the healing goes
through the entity before you its eyes flare
with intense energy glaring right at Jester and
it swells to twice its size with her presence arriving
 You watch this thing all of a sudden get
brighter and more intense You dont know what
that means Top of the round its turn Its going
to take two more strikes at you Let me see if it
gets its lightning back
 Nope All right Its going to make two more
strikes at you Yasha
 Ooh Thats going to be a  and a 
 First one comes at you with ten points of
bludgeoning damage reduced to five and five
points of lightning damage so ten total The
other strike  points of bludgeoning damage
reduced to five and then three points of
lightning damage
 It appears to be growing in size
 Its your turn Yasha
 How are you attacking with it What are you
doing to attack Its whipping around you
 Right now hes considered a large creature
so hes about five feet taller than you You see
only maybe a threefoot sphere glowing in its
face but its larger than the one foot it once was
 All right you swing coming down towards
where the leg is
  hits Roll damage
 No every turn you do it once plus seven
  points of damage on the first strike
Carves through the center of its leg area you
watch as energy dissipates The leg goes 
and vanishes Now its hovering lightly with the
other leg below it You see energy sparking around
where the legs reforming
 What are you doing with your second attack
 Reckless for all your attacks this round
yeah
  hits Roll damage a second time
 Ten points of damage You strike it again
with the blade It seems to shrug it off It seems
to be hardier than it was when you started this
fight
 Anything else you do on your turn
 What the necrotic damage
 Divine fury you get once per turn
 The necrotic damage from your shroud also
happens once per turn
 You have a bonus action you havent done
anything
 Is that your turn
 Jester youre up
 What are you doing Jester
 Okay How far do you back away
 Okay you back away ten feet
 As Jester backs away top of the round its
now the entitys turn First lets see if it gets
its it gets its lightning back Its going to
first attempt to move away from you Its going to
hover away and actually begin to rise up in the
air You do get an attack of opportunity towards it
 It is not reckless though because its
only on your turn
  misses The swing goes wide and it hovers
 feet up near the mast where the lower sail is
It hovers up in this space and looks up in the air
once more as its electrified wings unfurl and its
arm goes up as it stares down at you You see
these large blue sparks where its eyes would be
As it pulls its arm down the bolt strikes down
and slams into you once more Make another
dexterity saving throw with advantage
 That succeeds Okay and thats a good
thing You take  points of lightning damage and
you do not drop your weapon You shrug off the
numbness from the impact but it is  feet above you
 Which is out of your melee range Its up
near the sail on the mast Its your turn
 Do you wait for a response
 No response Just the sound of thunder and
lightning rolling
 How do you move closer to it
 Its above and back up by the mast and the
sail About  feet above you
 Not with the wings no
 Okay I mean theyre designed for climbing
So you go ahead and as its up in the air you
rush over to the mast Climbing your way up you
get to the edge and there is where the sail is in
the side youre holding onto it off the point
you manage to get within melee range of it You
used your action to call out to the Stormlord and
waiting for the response but youre now adjacent
to it
 Okay Jester You move further away get
closer reenter what are you doing
 Okay ten more feet Next round You watch
its physical size reduce It shrinks back down to
its original form matching yours onetoone As
it floats there its electrical wings not flapping
but arced held aloft at each of its sides On its
turn it does not get its lightning back Its
going to attempt to strike at you twice As it
rushes you towards the mast trying to knock you
off the first ones going to be a shove attack to
try and knock you off the mast Thats a natural
one No It goes to shove towards you and you just
pull in and it zips past At that point it comes
back around to try and claw at you with its other
hand Thats going to be a  to hit
 That is five points of bludgeoning damage
It would be ten but its reduced to five Then
four points of lightning damage Its going to
attempt to move up further away from you leaning
further up and away from the masthead Make
another attack of opportunity if youd like

  hits Roll damage And because of your
sentinel feat you prevent it from moving
 Ten points of damage As you arc past with
your blade and strike at it attempting to move
away its midsection separates and the lower legs
fizzle out and no longer exist Suddenly its
lower part of its torso flickers and then grows
two new legs made of pure electrical energy As
the winds blowing by your hair being thrown past
your shoulders the rain beating down on your face
as youre holding onto the side of the mast
leaning your arm in and then striking with your
twohanded sword best you can it cant seem to
find its way beyond your reach Now its your turn
 Okay Im going to say because of the
rain didnt do it last round but as youre now
up in this area holding on while also striking it
you have disadvantage on the attacks because it is
a twohanded weapon
 All right
  hits Go ahead and roll damage
  points of damage to it As it arcs past
one of the wings gets shaved off and falls and
sputters and turns to particle sparks before
vanishing into the storm The wing begins to
flicker to regrow itself You have your second
attack
 Well reckless is preventing the
disadvantage
 Whatd you roll
 No This one unfortunately goes wide with
the second strike as your arms looped through the
mast trying to hold on This time the other wing
manages to flicker in and it just ducks out of the
way Jester staying out or coming in
 All right Back to the top of the round The
creature now you see the storm growing heavier
and heavier around the rain now is coming in
heavy sheets across the deck The crews yelling
off you hear the shouting of the crewmen trying
to keep the sails from tearing You hear Fjord
shouting orders to them from behind but the words
arent reaching you Its just noise lost in the
wind and the sound of the storm around you Its
going to attempt well see
 It does get its lightning strike back
 As youre up there holding the mast knowing
its coming as the creature puts its hands up
the bolt strikes down once more slamming to you
and the mast I need you to make another dexterity
saving throw
 Wasnt a great roll so youre lucky on
that Thats  points of lightning damage
 But you drop your sword
 Which falls onto the ground Thats its
turn What are you doing Yasha
 Its five feet from you It hasnt pulled
away Youve prevented it from leaving but it did
manage to knock the weapon out of your hands
 The energy that it seems to create has this
field of electricity You do see the bright points
where its eyes are that are these two beacons of
intense electrical energy and the faint heartlike
glow that emanates from the center of its torso
The full thing is made of energy from different
intensity levels that almost give variations to
colors of blue and white
 Make an athletics check You do not have
disadvantage on this You have advantage because
of your
 Because youre raging still
 Okay  Thats a  You try and reach out
for it and it just manages to duck out of the way
You have a second attack Are you doing another
grapple or are you
 Go for it With advantage because youre
raging
 Yeah it does not succeed on that As it
ducks past the one you reach out getting to the
limits of your arm reach from the edge of the
mast As you do your hand plunges into its chest
 Next turn if you can keep it up As youre
holding it there and its grappled its strength
is zero Your hand is plunged about two or three
inches into the energy field that is its torso
You can feel your fingers vibrating with energy
and it hurts It hurts but you grit your teeth
Glaring past you can hear the waves crashing
around you The ship itself is rocking with heavy
momentum but youre focused on the moment On its
turn its going to attempt to attack you That is
a natural one You are lucky but the second one
is a  again Wait wait Yeah  Plus six Shit
 Man okay Oh lets see It does not get
its lightning back That would have been good to
roll beforehand
 Make a strength check
 With the raging Its okay
 You begin to pull and its giving As
youre yanking its wings are flickering and
sputtering Its arms are reaching up to grab
yours and its eyes that have been intensely
burrowed toward you begin to go wide
 Make another strength check with advantage
  As you pull it from the
chest the body flickers out and youre falling
the momentum pulling you off of the mast You
plummet  feet slamming into the deck
 You take five points of bludgeoning damage
from the impact reduced to two because of the
rage You crack down onto the hard wood of the
deck
 No fucking way
 Thats two episodes in a row
 Your fingers are buzzing You look and
theres nothing there
 Because the lightning mostly impacted Yasha
the damage was minimal to the mast thankfully If
she had succeeded on her save Oh wait no You
succeeded the last save
 The mast is a little damaged but with
immediate Mending Ill say you can undo it a
little bit
 Okay as you continue to help keep this ship
going through the middle of this storm you make
your way below deck and find Caduceus in his
chamber
 Since it was your vision if you wish to
look over the words that were told to you keep
that for you
 To the dock To the deck
 Okay
 Okay You make your way back up
 Its still raining but the storms ferocity
seems to have slowly diminished Its still a storm
 But you seem to have come through the bulk
of its intensity and danger and from your
experience knowing youre probably starting to
come out the other end Itll be a few more hours
of fording this but youre getting pretty
exhausted
 Okay Orly stays but sends Marius to go
ahead and wake Beau comes back up and shes in
his wake
 As the storm subsides slowly over the next
few hours and one by one you all eventually find
yourself feeling comfortable to return to your
quarters for an evenings rest the days travel
comes to a complete circle The morning comes with
clear skies as the distant gray fades in the
north Another half days travel leads you to see
a few bodies of land on the horizon
 I reckon towards them islands He points
over to the bodies of land on the horizon
 Now coming across the Gravid Archipelago
and youd know this a little bit though youve
not actually traveled to these before you can
see this trio of islands are rather rocky and are
only marked with small pockets of trees and
jungle Much of the land on these islands is
steep volcanic peaks with sheer cliff faces
pockmarked with caves Similar makeup as a lot of
Darktow actually they were both probably created
from similar volcanic activity from under the
ocean but not very welcominglooking islands
With little safe land to navigate or exploit for
resources there is very few reason for ships to
stop here As you guys begin to make your way you
can see the two nearest to you and the third
there What would you like to do
 Okay He goes ahead and continues the path
of the Balleater
 Nothing quite like high fantasy
 This is going to go real poorly
 This can be turned off
 Fun device
 Thank you Jeremy Crawford for showing me
that at the Stream of Many Eyes
 It was yes
 No it just said somewhere between them
 Yeah whoever is helming that will be able
to make either two separate perception checks or
aid one to make
 Are you aiding Caduceus or are you both
rolling
 Perception yeah With advantage
 Okay You keep an eye out there and spend
the next hour or so as you guys are coming into
position scanning the shores of each of the
islands Theres no sign of civilization Theyre
mostly dangerous jagged rocky shores with
pebbled beaches and bits and pieces of hints of
mangrove clusters at certain points of the shore
and elements of the occasional bit of jungle you
can see in pockets or valleys on each island For
the most part you dont see any sign of civilization
 Id say about now you guys could have
reached what would be considered as close to the
center as Orly can possibly maneuver the boat
 I mean there are caves all over the
volcanic rocky cliffs and peaks that come out
each island There are caverns and shelves It was
a violentlymade series of islands
 There is a moment of transition Its a
little awkward
  Into the ocean
  Below disappearing into the
depths
 Go ahead and make a perception check for
Frumpkin
 From the upper tier of the water Frumpkin
sees the water here is pretty clear
 Frumpkin is a bit distracted by the heavy
schools of fish that seem to be glittering beneath
the surface and catching a little bit of the light
thats making its way through the waves and
causing this array of sparkles roughly   
feet below the surface
 Continues deeper deeper Make another
perception check
 Okay First thing Frumpkin notices is the
ocean here is not as deep as the Divers Grave It
goes down maybe  feet Its still deep but
its a third of the depth you ended up having to
go down
 Frumpkin does see a shape amongst the
clusters of seaweed and other bits of life that
exist down there in natural ocean life You can
see chunks of ocean rock and volcanic rock things
that may have been lobbed from ancient volcanic
detonations and a tower a subocean tower thats
leaning at an angle You can see bits of broken
rock based around it and the seaweed is cluttered
up around the base of it
 Architecture constructed
 The top of it is somewhat jagged it has
sustained some erosion or damage towards its top
and it leads down inside You can see shelves or
bits where there may have been stairs or levels
but most of that has fallen inward and from
Frumpkins exterior perspective mostly hollow and
disappearing into darkness the further in With a
 Frumpkin also notices a little bit of
movement Towards the very tops of the seaweed
there are humanoid bodies that are tangled in the
seaweed a bit that appear to be floating there
and then one of them twitches and goes 
 Yeah
 Seems pretty clear
 Fumpkin didnt get a great look at them It
was uncertain one or the other but they appear to
be humanoid and wrapped in seaweed and then
 One of them seemed to twitch and move for a
second before going back to rest
 At this point its early afternoon Maybe
one or two hours after noon
 A familiar lightness in the lungs seems to
take root inside The air tastes a little bit
different once the incantation is complete You
feel the familiar point of anxiety build in your
chest since last time you dove
 You see her leave for a bit and then come
back with an empty bottle of mead
 About a quarter mile A quarter mile to a
mile to the nearest one Actually its probably a
little more than that a few miles
 Understood Yeah its about a mile to the
shore looking at the map there
 Well
 One by one you all make your way into the
ocean  The water is cold but you
adjust and begin to find your way down Are we
swimming stealthily or are we brazenly heading
towards this temple
 All right so were stealth missioning in I
need everybody to go ahead and make a stealth
check please
 Okay
 Youre moving at a slower speed swimming
below trying to be as stealthy as you can Making
your way further down the filtering light grows
dimmer and dimmer
 Theres a certain point where I assume
youre not trying to kill your weasel
 I fucked with you for a few weeks when you
were new to pet ownership but then after a few
close calls I figured The deeper it goes the
harder it is to see the colder it is a familiar sensation
 Its clear water so the light does carry
further and you guys arent going as deep You do
manage to make out as you get further and further
down the general shape of the tower within sight
It is comparatively murky because of the lack of
light but you can see the shape You can also
based on the warning that Caleb had given see
some of the figures You see about five of them
all tangled or wrapped in threads of this seaweed
Regular seaweed not the strange crimson type that
you came across in the Divers Grave
 Whats the range on that
 All right Youre going to have to get
pretty close to try it
 Okay as you swim down to get within range
to use your Eyes of the Grave thankfully the
nearest creature doesnt seem to notice your
approach It is not undead Make a perception check
 Actually roll at disadvantage because you
dont have darkvision unfortunately and youre
low enough now where the light is limited
 s still okay Now that you have a better
look at it at a closer perspective the humanoid
creature no clothing It is thin The limbs are
a little stretched but there are tiny fins at the
edge of the arms Along the sides of the head
there are gills It has a strange glance looking
around like a sentry almost Its not undead It
appears to be more of a fish person
 It has four appendages It has arms and
legs
 Nope Whats interesting is that one of its
lower appendages its right leg as youre
watching curls up and then unfurls One of its
legs seems to move similarly to one of the
appendages of Frumpkin
 Just one The others appear to be human
 One limb
 Well the nearest one you saw has You
arent close enough to the others to make out what
their physical representation is
 You have five here that are watching You
have to decide what is it going to be Is it a
brazen attack Is it some form of a stealth
mission What are you doing
 Theyre clustered enough around where
theyre not going to not see you You have nothing
youre hiding behind
 No a stealth mission in this would be
invisibility You would have to do something where
they cannot see you Otherwise theyre going to
see you
 I mean theyre not a perfect ring of five
around the top Theyre all hanging right towards
the top of the tower from the different layers of
seaweed Theyre anywhere from  to  feet from
each other Their arrangement is a bit uneven
 Mmhmm
 Looking at them all it looks like theyre
less wrapped and tangled and more like they have
an arm or a leg that theyve curled around it and
are anchoring themselves to it
 Kind of
 Youre above them
 Okay Caduceus has made that journey As you
continue to push in that direction you get to the
exterior of that range They seem to have not
noticed your presence yet
 All towards the same target
 Okay Those that need to roll attacks roll
attacks Those that need to roll damage roll damage
 Nope
 Natural 
 Both hit
  to hit Hits
 This entity breathing under the water
watches this glimmer of arcane energy Its
attention turns up towards it as it releases the
seaweed Then  and goes limp
under the water as a small cloud of its own blood
begins to fill the space around it At which
point the other four look up and notice your
presence from the lights that have been glowing
and the death of one of its comrades
 Roll initiative
 Ooh not good Well not good for them
either  to 
  to 
 All right thats Yasha  to ten
 Your movement is halved when youre
swimming except for Fjord
 Your movement is halved while youre
swimming just so you know You guys are about a
hundred feet away so its going to take a little
bit to get there for the melee folk
 Caleb youre up first Caleb and Jester
the four of them now begin to quickly swim up in
your direction They swim fast They swim faster
than you do at the very least
 About as fast as Fjord does
 Yep You can see their webbed fingers and
the spines and the scales of their arms and legs
They look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon
with a little bit of a slight more humanoid nose
and mouth Theyre now clambering up towards you
in the water What are you guys doing
 Okay Same one or different target
 It rolled a natural  again on its saving
throw Two natural s in a row Oh no this is
Guiding Bolt never mind He doesnt roll
anything Wasted natural  Matt Well done Its
okay Roll your attack
  Yeah that hits Their armor class is

  points of radiant damage It bursts and
glows underneath Its still alive You see the
blood splatter and it has this glowing energy
surrounding its torso making it easy to see in
the dark depths below Awesome that finished your
turn You cast Haste That ends your guys round
and youre backing away Yasha your turn
 Okay so movement of  feet Dash  feet
Thatd be your full round there Get you  feet
down so youre about  or so well no your
movement speed is  so its   Yeah youre
about  feet away
 Youll only move  feet then so youre 
feet away Got it okay Youre holding your
action to hit whenever it comes close All right
that finishes your turn Caduceus youre up
 What range
 No Theyre about a hundred feet away They
havent taken their turn yet
 What spell are you holding
 Okay Finishes your go Nott youre up
 Whats your interior range with your
weapon
 Correct Automatically misses a target
beyond the weapons normal range You dont roll
disadvantage for the first half the first 
feet but anything beyond  feet is an automatic
miss because at that point it loses momentum and
cant keep traveling
 Which you just learned
 You didnt need to You guys fucking
destroyed it Before it came to you it was
already dead
 Youve learned
 No you do not roll disadvantage if its
ranged
 It goes  and just floats
 Okay so you swim  feet You can bonus
action dash if you want
  feet in that gets there Now its their
turn They all doublemove  feet as they swim
upwards getting as close as they can That
definitely gets them in range for your spell
 You were  feet so no one gets into range
with you So Bane Youre hitting three of them
with Bane
 Okay theres three of them that have not
been hit Theres one that has
 Got it all right Saving throw is wisdom
 Sorry charisma Ooh minus one for them
Fail fail and fail
 They were  feet away from you and they
just moved  feet Theres  feet between the
two of you now
 All three of them fail All three of them
are Baned
 Got it Beau youre up
 Theyre about  feet from you
 You move towards the one that is glowing
You swim down Thats  feet so youre still 
feet away
 Thats the additional  feet That will get
you right into range of the one Jester hit Its
like  As you get really up close to it
now with the glowing light around it you get a
good look at its face Its covered in layers of
scales and spined points that come out at various
points of its facial features Its eyes are yellow
and a sick little side lens that closes
 You have advantage because of the Guiding
Bolt
  hits
 Oh but you do have disadvantage underwater
with melee attacks however So it cancels out
What was your first roll
 Ten misses That first strike just its
too slow
  hits
 It would be
 Five damage Its hurt but its still
going Thats the end of your turn Beau
 Fjord youre up Your speed is 
underwater so you can go to any of them
 You Aquaman it through the water towards it
 Okay The first ones going to be at one of
the ones thats untouched
 Yep Both 
 Next two
 The second attack action can only be used
for a single weapon attack or disengage dash
 Yeah so you have to use your sword
 The falchion comes into your hand You dash
towards which one The one with Beau or
 Oh buddy Underwater man not feeling very
underwaterlike right now unfortunately
 Thats okay Finishes your go Top of the
round Caleb and Jester
 It makes its saving throw
 Thats right Thats a natural 
 What was the save
 Yeah its  Sorry That finishes your
turn then or are you going to move closer Stay put
 All right you stay put Caleb
 Okay At your range roll for attack
 It travels half the distance then sputters
out consumed by the ocean
 You dont know
 You move back even further Yasha youre
up
 You can move your  feet and get in range
for any of them
 Take your pick Theres three untouched and
theres one that Beau has done some damage to
 Yes
 One of those thats untouched yet Its
disadvantage on your attacks with melee underwater
 Unless youre reckless in which case
theyre straight rolls Are you reckless
 Go for it First attack single roll
  hits Roll damage This is your full
d
 Okay there you go Ill let you do that
 Its okay Remember that
  points with the first strike It carves
through immediately filling the water around it
with its dark blood as it scrambles around Looks
pretty hurt
 Go for it
 Well reckless is a single attack
 Ooh no Second one goes wide Youre not
used to fighting underwater Youve only done it a
few times and still its a big blade through a
lot of resistance That finishes your go
Caduceus youre up
 Natural seven Thats a failure It has a
minus one
 The burst of light from underneath it hits
it It starts gurgling in pain
 It is holding on by a thread It is torn
asunder and you can bless you Its obscured by
a cloud of its own murky blood right now That
finishes your turn Caduceus Nott youre up
  hits Roll damage
  It is done
 Okay go for it
  hits exactly
 Even better There you go Definitely hits
 Correct You only get that once per turn
 Eight damage One  the other one
 Two immediate fires Two of them go
limp and begin to float in their own ichor Well
done
 Okay finishes Notts go Its their turn
Now theyre in range Two of them move one of
them towards you Yasha and ones against Beau
Trying to its been a lot
 Its going to make two attacks against you
with its unarmed strike Its clawing at you with
its hands That is a  and a 
 Oh no Let me do that  Misses
 On the third strike its going to use its
Piscine Anatomy
 I mean one of the other ones maybe but
that one no This one it strikes twice at you
with its claws Then its throat bubbling
spitting and it spits this tiny needle towards you
 Thats going to be  Oh with another
negative three 
 The other one is going to attack you twice
Yasha You were reckless so it has advantage on
its attacks against you It would be  and a 
 minus two so its a 
  minus three is a 
 One hits you for six points of piercing
damage as it claws or this would be a bite It
grabs and bites towards you
 Oh no its a strike so bludgeoning Its
halved to three You take three points of
bludgeoning damage This one is going to attempt
to grab you with the tentacle Natural 
 You dont know
 Its a critical hit up to you Are you
canceling it or not
 Okay It still hits but its not a
critical You take eight points of bludgeoning
damage reduced to four and you are grappled As
its tentacle reaches around you another one that
looks like it has a protrusion from its chest
almost like a third arm its a tentacle that
wraps around and grabs at your torso and is
crushing you You can feel faint bits of it that
are scraping at the skin That finishes their
turn Beau youre up
 Theres the one that was attacking you
thats right in your face and theres the one
thats grappled Yasha with a tentacle
 Go for it Two attacks with disadvantage
 Eight damage all righty 
 It looks like a person or a creature that
had been hit with a staff pretty hard
  just hits
  points of damage Its jaw snaps out of
place It looks like its trying to bite towards
you but its jaw is limply unable to close
 Its still going
 Ki point Two more hits
 All right roll your
  damage You crack again The jaw actually
tears off and bloods filling Its eyes are going
wide Its barely holding on
 Okay so ten damage gotcha All right
thats all right And your final attack
 Okay With the last hit as its jaw snapped
apart you grab its head and ram it into your
knee and as you pull the leg back the face is
collapsed inward and it goes limp
 Like Oh god Okay That finishes your
go Fjord
 One left and it currently has Yasha grappled
in the tentacle and trying to crush her
 Yep
 They are
 You may As the body is floating in the
water away this cold sensation takes the nearby
foot radius around it What little bit of light
is filtering through here gets darker and a
darkened spectral form emerges from its body This
ghostly wraith emerges from the corpse under
Fjords command
 Go for it
 That hits
 That hits Damage on both
  points of damage Both bolts impact
sounds into it Its damaged but its still
holding on and its turning towards
 Dash in with the blade out at the side
 Make your strike
 You do not have disadvantage because of your
armor so that hits Go ahead and roll damage with
your blade
 Well
 Dont you get to add your charisma modifier
to the damage bonus
 Pretty sure as a hexblade warlock you get to
add your charisma bonus to attack and damage
rolls right Am I wrong about that
 You have in the past Im pretty sure
unless Im reading this wrong
 It should be
 Yeah its based on your strength Maybe it
updated recently and that got reset
 Ill have to double check because
 Correct
 Well it should be an additional plus four
damage is what it should be
 Yeah right Ill fix that
 Okay After the two impacts and the sword
slicing through it its still standing but its
hurt Its still holding onto Yasha and right now
its distracted trying to figure out which way to
go That finishes your go Fjord
 Caleb and Jester youre up next
 Theres one holding onto Yasha
 That is a  on its Toll the Dead
 And the  damage
 Ooh
 As the tentacle is grappling and crushing
your body and youre trying to find a way to force
your way through suddenly the tentacle just
pulls away You look over towards it the tentacle
isnt attached to anything It is turned to chum
in the water as bits of its scattered body begin
to slowly dissipate and disseminate throughout the
nearby sea
  Magic Missiles impacting and
scattering its form Currently there doesnt
appear to be any of these creatures around you
Theres just the darkness of the tower below and
whatever the inside of it holds
 Its hard to see this low in the water when
theres so little light when its not moving Once
it shifts its like watching a shadow out of the
corner of your eye with these two faintly dull
glowing yellow eyes Its vaguely humanoid in its
shape but its almost smoky and amorphous when it
shifts and moves and finds its place nearby Its
head lolls around a bit mimicking the shape and
the movement of the creature before it was engaged
in combat
 Okay You sending it in there by itself
 Okay
 You guys watch as the specter vanishes into
the shadow of the tower below
 Oh just the entrance
 Okay It moves comes to the top
 No it does not open its maw and devour your
specter
 Fair enough Yeah it drifts in and once it
hits the mouth of it its near impossible to see
because its just black on black until you see its
head turn and you can see the very faint light of
its eyes It sits there awaiting its next
command Its making you uncomfortable
 As far as you can tell there is just the
one entrance
 If you want to try and swim along the edges
of it you can look for other entrances
 Perception check for Frumpkin please
 Okay Frumpkin having a hard time seeing
through the clustered seaweed Around its base I
mean with a natural one yeah you dont see
anything Frumpkin makes out no shapes or anything
within that period Frumpkins not used to being
an octopus okay He still hasnt quite figured it out
 Okay
 Youre not in combat right now so we can
just
 Thats true though youre getting really
close to the end of it It lasts for a minute so
 You guys have been chatting back and forth
and doing this and especially with Frumpkin
looking around like that yeah Haste has worn
off
 No you just get stunned for a round
But youre not in combat anymore
 Yeah a little heart palpitation moment
Okay Are you going to do a spiral around it or
are you going to go down one side What are you
doing Are you just stopping
 You guys are above it At this point youre
about  or so feet above the top of this curved tower
 Its at a slight angle yeah
 Okay Are you doing it stealthily or are you
trying to go for speed
 All right Itll take you a little bit but
go ahead and roll a stealth check
 Yeah Blessing of the Trickster
 All right Make a perception check for me
please as youre keeping an eye out
 Okay Make a perception check
 All right As you curl down there are
slits There are narrow peering points at
different areas You do see the occasional window
or an opening where somebody could probably
squeeze through At the very base of it there
does appear to be an open doorway
 Correct
 Okay Youre keeping an eye out from the
top As you head down you see that entranceway
look over look around and see the other faint
bits of windows You look back down at the door
and you see the very edge of something in the
door You see a yellowishgreen shape looks
almost best I can describe it at this distance
is a hint of crustacean that then vanishes into
the doorway
 Okay You wait for  seconds A minute
 Nothing but you get the sense that
something noticed you
 Okay you all join Fjord
 Okay The specter drifts down to the center
of the doorway and hangs there
 Okay The specter vanishes inside
 Make a perception check
 Yeah you dont hear anything Caduceus
just instinctually you hear what sounds like the
thrashing of water the impact of scraping against
stone more thrashing then silence
 Okay youre both now resting a distance
from it
 Make a perception check
 With a lack of light you have your
goggles which helps you can barely make out
shapes and theres a few of them Its like
looking into a boiling pot where theres shapes
shifting in different places clustered With what
little bit you can see at your peripheral its
like whatever texture the bottom of this temple
has the texture is moving
 From the top Its about  feet
 Sure
 Mmhmm
 You make out the same thing
 Do you send them in
 Its a little more than  feet tall to the
peak
 Okay As you guys are paying attention and
glance inside there are different shelves of
broken floors that have either fallen through or
stairs that have collapsed where theres you can
see where at one point this temple may have been
ascended by somebody but a hollow on the inside
towards the base of it You can see three of these
large creatures covered in chitinouslike armor
Their lower half has four legs that are
insectlike or you could say crablike if you
will and then the upper torso has two large
pincers that are jagged on the inside Their
face you dont see eyes its this smooth
surface with a series of these weird wormlike
tentacles that emerge from underneath the mouth
that curl As soon as the light hits they begin
to look around towards it and glancing up and they
have all backed into it and that shape that you
were seeing before was all three of them clustered
together and rotating and moving in the space
 Theyre not backing away from it Theyre
backtoback looking and preparing for whatever
is the source of this
 You are about  or so feet lets say If
you want to get closer
 Mark down your Bless
 All right Is everyone gathering on the
floor
 Youve all descended down to the floor of
the ocean about roughly   feet from this open
doorway that leads inside the temple As you have
your spells prepared ready to delve inside you
take a breath of the deep ocean water in your
lungs and exhale its thick cold liquid and steel

 Welcome back Last we left off The Mighty
Nein after surviving their encounters in Darktow
traveling to and from Urukayxl and managing to
release one of the gathered orbs of Ukotoas
sealing You made your way to the depths of the
Divers Grave and recovered the third of these
orbs that youve come across Two of which now
reside within Fjords person You then proceeded
on towards what you believed to be the location of
one of these temples through a series of visions
youve had by Ukotoa I knew it was coming You
made your way towards this archipelago Looked
around set your ship in the center cast Water
Breathing on the group and you all dove down
beneath the waters and found this slightly angled
ruin This partially crumbled temple that sits
there at the base of the ocean floor You saw
long straggling pieces of seaweed slowly waving
with the water and what looked to be drowned
bodies tangled in them that upon your approach
began to clamber towards you You fought off a
number of them managed to clear that space and
then investigate within the interior of this
temple tower Looking inside with a bit of light
there looked to be some sort of large mutant
crustaceanlike creatures all gathered up on the
inside Not entirely certain of the number just a
series of claws and armor and barnacles Backing
away you all just set yourselves on the ocean
floor about   feet away from the base
doorway And thats where we left off So Mighty
Nein lets go ahead and roll initiative
 Well you better hurry up quickly
 Organize yourself where you would like to be
in this area
 You said you were all together about  to
 feet away from the base of the tower
 You were clambering on top of it looked
inside and then moved off of the edge
 A little greefy Like that greefy
 What you know right now theres just this
one door here and a lot of cracked sections of the stone
 Initiatives  to 
  to 
  to ten
 All right Fjord Jester and Caduceus
 Correct
 Beau Nott You guys are up first Nott has
a higher dexterity so technically you can go
first unless you want to coordinate something
together
 You saw a lot of movement inside
   for you for one movement
 You can use your action to get over here if
you want to or you can use a ki point and bonus
because its half movement
 Okay Nott
 Thats as far as you can get
 Maybe
 You guys slowly bound along the seafloor
your feet gently pushing into the silt soft
against the base of your foot You both flank
around each side of the open doorway preparing
yourselves for any sort of physical interaction
Ending both your turns that brings us to Caleb
What are you doing
 To Beau
 To Nott Got it Finishing Calebs go
 Theres a faint pause as youre holding back
and preparing your spell Two elongated
bluishgreen hands peer through Some sort of a
humanoid looking creature but its skin somewhat
of a deeper bluer tint than the fish humanoids
you had battled on the way in You see it kind of
peeks through and glances out toward those of you
who that are currently still visible across the
way Its face humanoid Eyes a dull sunken
yellowishgreen color but where its mouth is
its two flaps of skin like a central mouth that
is vertical Peeks out you see rubbery dark
tendrils that pull off of its head like a thicker
Predator just beyond the interior
 On the inside yes
 As it peers through its jaw opens up
splits open You can see two rows of teeth on the
inside and the bony projections that holds it open
and gives it this six foot wingspan of open jaw to
each part It gives this dull screaming noise as
it begins to dart forward
 From the doorway First off immediately
Nott and Beau you were holding actions Go for it
 Correct So for the time being you are
considered hasted and Caleb you are
concentrating on Haste
 Correct
 That does hit
 Apparently it does not see you and its
adjacent to Beau at the time as it rushes past
Beau It seems more focused on the group in the
back So your attack does hit and you do get
sneak attack
  points of damage
 You got it As the creature begins to skulk
through and kicks off the stone outside of this
temple it swims at a faster speed than you were
expecting and as it darts past Beau Beau swings
but goes wide no impact with the staff You
however use that moment watch as the bolt from
the crossbow sinks into its chest It braces a
bit but keeps darting forward using the rest of
its movement to go
 Its a unique sound because you hear Notts
scream go Ah right as its voice  It
screams out this highpitched threetoned whine
that causes all of you to reach for your ears I
need everybody within  feet to make a wisdom
saving throw
 Yasha and Fjord are all right Beau the
rocking pain in your head causes your vision to go
white and your muscles seize up and you are
stunned for the next round Caleb
 You just barely manage to shrug it off no
issue Nott
 As you feel the adrenaline burst into your
system and you begin to move backward preparing
your next bolt it sears into your brain and your
scream immediately cuts to a halt as your lungs
hold in place Jester Natural one You as well
find yourself doubling over here your feet
pulling up towards your chest as you float and
drift to the side clutching yourself Caduceus
 You just manage to shrug it off It hurts
and your hands go to block it but as soon as you
shake it off your eyes focus forward Thats
going to end its turn That brings us to Fjord
 
 You guys can swim so there is an up and
down if you need it
 Go for it
  does not hit
  does hit
 The first one it sees you move and you see
its brow furrow realizing that you werent
impacted by the scream The first one it ducks
out of the way It spins around and you catch it
with the second hit
 You got it Fjord that ends your go
Jester you are stunned
 But you will have your next turn It only
lasts until the end of its next turn As you sit
there grasping at your head you can taste iron
in your mouth mingling with the ocean
 That brings us to Caduceus
 Okay so all you guys have Bless Now you
have dual Bless most of the party This is
actually a pretty good combo
 Along the ground
 Thatd put you at about there All right
that ends Caduceus go At this point you hear
this scratching sound skittering The doorway
that was right there you watch something claw and
tries to pull through and then shoves into it The
stone around the entrance breaks open and the
entryway opens slightly as bursting forth
 One of the creatures from the inside that
you had seen before
 You saw a glimmering hint of it looking
below but you see this large crustaceanlike
entity that has heavy pincer claws Its face
descends into tendrils these tiny little
tentacles that writhe and curl under its mouth It
has a pair of four legs very arachnidlike that
scurry across the ground Another one skitters up
to the top
 And another one from the inside
 They can swim too
 The one thats next to Beau is going to take
two strikes at you with its pincers
 You are so thats advantage
 No stunned is not paralyzed Paralyzed is
different than that thats a Hold Person thing
That is a  to hit You take from the impact on
that one dual sixes on two d Thats  points of
bludgeoning damage and you are grappled The
other attack is going to be  to hit
 Miss
 As you pull back even though youre
stunned it grapples you with one hand and goes to
try and grab you with the other and you just
manage while still stunned to pull just out of
its grasp However you are grappled so its
going to use its tentacle attack on you as well
You need to make a constitution saving throw
 Usually you have to try and pull somebody
out of a grapple or push it away from them
 As it pulls you in with its grappled claws
tentacles begin to reach towards your shoulders
and neck and like a jellyfish you feel the sting
hit you but you manage to just writhe enough away
and whatever toxin that is trying to release and
pour into your system doesnt actually find
purchase within your internal body
 Thats their turn That brings us to Yasha
 There you go good memory
  hits
 Also hits Both attacks hit
 All right As she swings through
 As Yasha moves forward sword swinging
and oh both of those attacks technically have
disadvantage because youre underwater
 So roll once for each again just to see
 Actually are you affected by it with your
mariners armor
 She is thats right
 Yep still hits
 Yeah already cool shes fine Sword while
still resistant against the water manages to
strike twice and carving into this creature who
had already taken the blasts from the other
members of your party The blood around it begins
to fill the area with this dark
bluepurplecrimson coloring That finishes
Yashas turn
 All right bringing us to the top Beau and
Nott youre up
 Nope You will be soon
 Thats your turn Youre no longer stunned
Bringing us to Caleb
 Three correct
 All right four missiles
 Eight points of damage total
  points of damage As its taking the
blasts from all of them carved through by Yasha
it starts trying to back away as the missiles
through the water carving these little paths of
bubbles behind them slamming into each side It
drifts there lifeless in the water next to Yasha
 That ends Calebs turn Its your movement
and action correct
 Holding on to your haste It is now that
creatures turn but its dead Fjord youre up
 Yeah
 Sure Back this way This way
 Thatll put you right up there
 You boof up in the air around it
 Go for it
 Against which one
 All right got you
 Both hit
 You got it
 Okay that ends Fjords turn Jester and
Caduceus you guys are up next Both concentrating
on Bless right
 Ill mark that for the two of you as well
Whatre you doing
 Where would you like for it to be
 Okay The range on that is  feet
 Yeah so you can definitely get it You want
it on this edge
 All right go for it Take it strike
 Its been a few weeks Add your spell
 Your spell attack modifier which is your
proficiency bonus plus your wisdom modifier
 The difference three weeks can make
 That hits No it doesnt It just misses
Oh shit sorry
 You do Youre blessed by Caduceus Oh you
did
 Im sorry It swings through It manages to
hit the side of its body and then scrape off of
its hard armored exterior
 Same one over here
 Is that its dexterity
 That is going to be a seven
 All righty
 The flame bursts around and it seems to
shrug it off That ends your turn Going to stay
where you are
 All right Caduceus
 Circle around this way
 Holding your action for that
 You got it Ending Caduceus go its their
turn This one here that has Beau grappled is
going to spin around which is going to open the
doorway This guy here both of them are going to
leave behind this region This guy is going to
double move This ones going to come down and get
into melee with you but thats its turn It moved
and dashed This one here is going to swoop down
Same thing move and dash and its going to head
towards Yasha And then
 Another one comes through the doorway here
 Yep
 He is going to attempt to move past Beau
Which Beau if you want to take it even though
youre grappled you can take your attack of
opportunity to stop it or let it go
 Yeah hes dead Youre no longer stunned
 Up to you Youre grappling You see him
running by
  hits Roll damage
 You should be You have to roll one more
time
 Six points of damage You got it We have
two of them who dashed down swimming through the
water curling through the water and then two
stuck on Beauregard You are grappled by the first
one Its going to make two pincer attacks and
tentacles against you
 Natural four and a natural two Its going
to be a ten and an eight so youre still
grappled Hes still holding you but cant quite
squeeze onto the other one cant snap at you
Make another constitution saving throw for me
please
 The tentacles  towards you and
you dodge out of the way keeping it at bay Its
barely touching the edge of your neck as youre
trying to shove it The other guy swings around
after being impacted by you and begins to make two
pincer attacks against you as well
 Natural  and natural  Not even joking
Im pretty sure that hits you
 No
 For the noncrit that is going to be 
points of bludgeoning damage Crit is going to be
 points of bludgeoning damage
 Correct I need you to make a constitution
saving throw You managed to dodge away from the
first one barely noticing the other one come up
from behind clasp on and then grapple you Youre
now grappled by each of them One of them has you
by the torso the other by the legs and theyre
almost pulling you in half As it gets another
claw into the side and it reaches in its
tentacles begin reaching toward your shoulders
Whatd you roll
 Thats okay you manage to resist the
toxins You manage to push them back and forth
Both of their heads are pulling towards you Its
closing in your space All you see is a smattering
of claws angry alien faces and red filling the
water around you your own That finishes their
turn Yashas up
 You dont know
 You got it Straight attack on these
  hits
 Roll damage for the first attack which is
doubled because the creatures vulnerable because
of Caduceus Seeing Yasha strike towards it
focuses divine energy and makes it briefly
vulnerable to the strike
 Yep
  points of slashing damage against the
first guy
 As it swims down and lands Yasha carves
into it With each strike part of its
underbellied shell cracks open slightly and bits
of dull grayishblack liquid begin to fill the
area around it Its head streaks back and its
tentacles go wild and you can see from the inside
a strange series of clear tendrils that come out
of an interior mouth Theres a brief moment of
this really creepy alien physicality but Yasha
is focused and raging and swinging the blade as
hard as she can Ending her turn bringing us to
he top of the round Beau and Nott you guys are up
 Oh buddy
 Okay Lets see here Its an intelligence
saving throw They are not intelligent
 That is cocked That is a  minus three
Nine
 Which one of these and what do you create
 Yes you can
 Well get to what it does on its turn but
yeah As soon as you complete the spell its head
suddenly jerks back twice three times You get
the sense its had effect
 You are blessed I believe right
  hits
 Yeah because its adjacent to Beau
 Is this the same one that has Phantasmal
Force
 The other one How much was that That
was
 Yeah an extra seven  points of damage in
one strike The other one thats holding onto
Beau shes still being pulled apart from the two
different claws Shes about to be bishopped The
secondary one as its not freaking out its
tendrils are trying to reach around her face
Suddenly the side of the bolt jams into where you
imagine an ocular socket would be in a normal
creature As it impacts the head jerks back
Little bit of cloud of blood pools off of it and
it looks over in your direction
 That hits Rogues man
 Nice A second bolt hits it It looks back
in your direction with a second bolt Now theres
two of them sticking out the side of its face Two
of the tentacles curl up around them wrapping
onto whatever purchase it finds on its face
trying to pull it out That ends your turn You
want to move
 You move in ducking into the mix there
Perfect That ends your turn Caleb youre up
 Oh thats right Beau
 You are You cannot move unless you break
the grapple Its an action to attempt to escape
 A successful grapple attempt would be
against both of them but theyd both get to roll
to try and keep you grappled Its only one action
to try and break from both if you wanted to break
free Up to you
 Fair enough Respect that
  hits Its with disadvantage right
 Roll with disadvantage on these attacks
 First swing snaps onto its armor Your
knuckles crack in the instance and you feel a
sharp pain through your wrist Make your next
attack
  hits Roll damage
 Constitution saving throw Its a plus
three but its a natural four Seven
 It drops the grapple The grip that it has
on you laxes as suddenly the area where you
managed to jam the fist right underneath the jaw
causes part of its throat to collapse inward and
its at the moment not sure where it is You feel
that one release The other one still has you
though Thats your action You still have your
bonus
 Yeah All grapple does is lower your speed
to zero You cant move Restrained is what really
fucks you up because that gives advantage on
attacks against you
 Where its eyes would be you imagine Trying
to look for an eye to glare at Perfect That ends
your turn Beau Caleb youre up
 thlevel Magic Missile
  points of damage against which one
 You got it Perfect  points of damage on
that Each one impacts The shell darkens from the
blasts as all six bolts you fullon
Robotechstyle missile into the sides of it
Theres a series of small dull explosion sounds
in the nearby water before it goes still Its
still moving and shifting around but its head is
thrashing about wildly seemingly distracted by
something you cant see
 Now its their go The one that is still
holding Beau releases her and begins scrabbling
towards its face It manages to strike out and
clasp nothing Natural  Critical hit on nothing
as its striking out in the direction of its face
trying to clear this little goblin off of its
visual cortex its tentacles reaching out to
nothing It moves and shifts this way to try and
scrape and get off Its going to wreck it there
Does it get to make a saving throw at the end of
each of its turn
 It does It doesnt get to save every turn
it looks like but it lasts for a minute You can
continue to do damage to it It thinks its real
but its starting to wonder as its done a few
hits that should have snatched this thing up Its
finding no purchase so you get the sense that
maybe the illusion is starting to youve gotten
a round of distraction from it Ill put it that way
 So its just a quick little goblin

 Yeah Interesting so its more frustrated
that its taking damage from this little creature
but the damage is negligible Its now like Fuck
it
 This is me rationalizing its
rationalization
 You manage to get her free of the grapple
 He did
 Go for it
 Oh you rolled a natural one
 He does move Its fine
 That one shoots past that one here towards
Caduceus Actually I looked at the wrong order
Theres a few more turns before they get a chance
to go Well say that happened if it gets to it
That was actually the initiative for the creature
that youve already killed Fjord youre up
 Same height or are you lowering yourself
 You can get into melee Ill say with this
one Technically both of them you can get to both
of them
 It is yes
 You gotcha Both attacks are advantage
against the stunned creature I believe Yes
 Correct
 Yeah that hits
  hits Damage for the second strike go
for it As you swim down quickly falchion
whack slicing across it
 On the one thats stunned
 Sure There you go Fjord that finishes
your go Jester and Caduceus you guys are up
 It can move  feet right
 Nope It floats partway down jeez I keep
dropping everything Been gone for three weeks and
I cant even function It does get part of the
way but next round it can get down there
 I know
 Youre going to swim up over the
 You can get one two three Thats as far
as you can get
 Swimming is half movement unfortunately
 Its a constitution saving throw
 That is a 
 Beautiful The area around its head where
theres an armored shell that protects its face
area cracks a bit from the impact Bits of its
shell are starting to flake off That ones
starting to look pretty hurt
 Are you going to move or stay where you
are
 That ends your turn then Caduceus
 It will make an attack of opportunity on you
as it sees you disappear It goes out towards you
It has disadvantage on the attack That is  to
hit
 You do
 Roll damage first
  points of damage nice The strength
saving throw is a six
 Thatd be your spell DC
  It gets blasted back from the
impact You see a flash from the shield and this
bubble of energy well up and then force it back
with a sudden impact as it gets pushed away You
dart around the side
 Thats your action
 Okay cool That ends your turn Next up is
their turn The one that got blasted back is going
to move   Its not within range to
actually get anybody and it doesnt see where you
are so instead the person that it sees
immediately is going to be Caleb Then it moves
the rest of its  feet to get into
 Well say it knocks you a little bit out of
the way but it doesnt have anything to attack
with because it used its action to get up next to
you Currently is in melee with both of you No I
didnt come across you It didnt quite cross your
path This one over here is going to
 This ones stunned This one here is going
to be now up against Fjord Its going to strike
out towards you twice Fjord
 You can still do damage with it every turn
and it still sees it and is considering it
actually Ill make an intelligence saving throw
 No its true Youre right
 No youre right I fucked up my own order
Cool
 It did No I had it waste its action to try
and attack the thing Yep As the two very big
attacks on nothing its starting to not worry
about it The other one is stunned That ends its
turn The one on Yasha is going to attack twice
Thats going to be a natural 
 You were using you reaction to hold your
 When youre holding an action it uses your
reaction to release it
 The other one is a  to hit
 All right Critical is  bludgeoning damage
to her reduced to  and the second one is nine
points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four
Shes grappled by it It has her held in both of
its claws holding her there in front and then
tendrils begin to move towards her face She needs
to make a constitution saving throw please
 Shes dealt with harsher toxins than this
She doesnt even duck out of the way She just
takes it and it doesnt have an effect It burns
and nothing I got that one and that one Yeah
thats their turn Man that stun That stun and
that illusion That ends their go Yashas up now
  just hits
 Misses
 But the first one does hit
 The first strike goes through so its full
damage times two
  points of damage How does Yasha want to
do this
 As she drags it down the side of its body
she puts her foot up and using that she pushes
to the side and watches it tear in half You see a
bunch of internal purple sinew and muscle tear
open It gives this horrible dull squeak sound
before it goes limp and begins to float and slowly
sink to the bottom
 That finishes Yashas turn She has
movement yes
 All right One two three She gets into
that one there
 Yep
 All right that finishes Yashas go Beau
and Nott you guys are up
 That one is still stunned because its
until the end of your next turn
 Go for it
 No attack of opportunity from the one thats
stunned so as you flip through the water
 Go for it
  hits You can roll and extra d Its
still going to hit
 Yeah so the first one hits Roll damage for
that
 Okay How much damage was that
 Natural one So now hes stunned Monks
man
 As you dart over remember the place right
under its jaw where youre seeing its tendrils are
trying to go towards you you jam the staff right
into its throat there and as it does it pulls
back unable to really get its bearings
 Second attack
 These are both happening in the air as
youre arcing
 Correct
 Damn The luck on this round
 Six points of damage All right
 You still have your bonus
 Technically theyre both stunned but which
one do you want to do
 Okay the one that was stunned first Got
it
  just hits
 Ten points of damage all right
 Thats the only time Ive ever seen a cocked
d On the edge yeah
 I know its impressive
  hits
 That is two impacts as you bludgeon that one
whos stunned and arc on the other side Its
looking hurt but its still in the fight That
ends your turn
 All right Beaus done Nott
 Okay
 Those creatures are all stunned and theyre
within your short range so you have advantage on
the attacks
 Okay so they all hit
 Sam
 Now you do All right first attack
 That hits
 That hits
 That hits Against which ones
 The first strike is against him Roll your
sneak attack on him
 The bolt gets lodged in its throat and it
just managed to shrug off the actually no that
ones not stunned anymore because it was the end
of your turn Oh man I got this all confused My
own fault go ahead That first one probably would
have hit anyway at this distance so that damage
does take it out
 Right
 All right The first one wipes it out How
do you want to do this

 Three weeks Getting rusty
 Correct
 It slowly crumples to the bottom of the
ocean
 Take your next strike The other one is
stunned so those two other strikes would have
hit so youre fine
 Yeah roll damage for the other two
 All right so  total Got it
 Correct
 It takes the impact and spins around trying
to look towards you and it sees you but then
youre still on its face Its very confused
 Yeah Its not having a good day
 That finishes your turn Nott Caleb youre
up
  points of damage
 Probably That ends your go Caleb The
impacts in the front of it Parts of its chest
blacken from the blast of the Magic Missile but
it shrugs it off This one seems relatively
comparably unharmed to the others Its taken a
few hits but its doing all right That finishes
your go Caleb Fjord youre up
 He slams the falchion into the ground
Theres a blast of electrical energy and this
force wave immediately sucks in and theyre
missing Theyre gone Where are you guys going
 You got it
 Does it get a dex saving throw against that
to try and reduce damage
 That is going to be a 
 So does it take damage Half damage
 Got it
 Ten damage As the water explodes and then
sucks in the creature is stunned and is looking
very hurt but its still 
 Correct The creature is ten spaces wide
 You can Fuckstick has been Hexed
 For which one Oh for Hex
 No Hex was the other one that had died
 Sorry
 Thats all right That finishes Fjords go
Jester Caduceus youre up Caduceus you
reappear in your space
 Go for it
 It has advantage because its stunned
 Its a Spiritual Weapon Its not material
so its not hindered by
  hits
 How do you want to do this

 Eventually it jams itself into this
creatures maw repeatedly as it backs away The
back of its shelled head begins to crack before it
splinters at the back The Spiritual Weapon
emerges from the back of its skull and it crumples
to the ground
 Over here All right
 All right Because of Calebs position you
do have flanking bonus so you have advantage on
the attack roll
 Technically its considered a melee attack
so you would have disadvantage on the strike but
it give you advantage because hes there so its
just a straight roll
  hits
 d Ooh Roll some damage
 As you reach out after flipping over and
landing behind it you grab the back of it and
you see the divine energy pulse through this dull
grayishblue energy arc down your forearms hit
the shell and these sparks of dark energy break
through causing these small bits of its shell to
break and flake off in areas Its shocked from
the impact Did a pretty decent bit of hurt to it
That the end of your turn I believe it does
Caduceus what are you doing
 Its going to make an attack towards you
 Thats going to be  to hit
 Okay You take eight plus six points of
damage thats  and you are grappled so you do
not move
 You do Also make a constitution saving
throw to see if you can maintain Bless
 Nine Bless fades Those who were blessed by
Caduceus you no longer get your d bonuses
 Dex saving throw Natural one
 You got it After it grabs and pulls you in
you actually blast it from inside its claw You
release the spell from your staff and the flame
burns up the outside blackening the outside of
its crustaceanlike armored shell Ending your
turn Caduceus correct All right Its now its
turn It has Caduceus grappled in one claw Yep
Yeah its going to continue its path It releases
Caduceus and its going to go all in on its
original quarry which is Caleb Its a natural 
plus six thats  to hit
  points of bludgeoning damage and you are
grappled
 Second attack Thats going to be  to
hit
 That is  points of bludgeoning damage As
it slams both of its claws into you its grabbing
you from both sides of your torso and legs
pulling apart as the pain hits in It grabs you in
towards its face and its tendrils lap around your
head and neck area Make a constitution saving
throw for me
 As the venom pulses into your body you feel
your entire torso legs arms seize with searing
pain You are paralyzed and poisoned
 Why would you have had to change it
 I trust you on that  would resist it
Its a DC 
 So yeah and that would be enough to resist
it
 As the poison begins to pulse into your
system in the moment the pain begins to hit the
back of your skull you immediately glance towards
the transmuters stone that youre clutching in
your right hand and with that you feel the
energy pulse through your body and shrug off the
toxin from entering the deep parts of your
system
 Perfect Ending its turn Yashas up
 Sure
 She looks inside and there skitter no
Im kidding

 Looking through the interior of the now
partially jagged broken entrance to this temples
base you can see this very heavily covered
seaweedinfested interior that wraps around the
inside and one central big knotted tangle of
seaweed
 Is that Yashas turn
 Top of the round
 Beau and Nott
 Yes it will Its where Notts been the
whole time Hiding right over there
 Excuse me
 You scoot around and jam it
 For your second attack
 Unfortunately no Your first strike is
prodding it with the staff You still have your
bonus action
  misses unfortunately Doesnt miss you
impact and reach through and
 That finishes Beaus turn Nott youre up
 There you go
 All right roll your sneak attack damage
 Yes you do
 How do you want to do this

 Theres a brief bit of warm hot sharp pain
on the outside of your earlobe
 as the bolt enters the base of the
creatures skull You dont see it protrude You
dont even know where it went You just see it
vanish and the creature is standing there for a
second As it falls onto its back its legs all
curl in like a spider and its claws close in
 Thats right
 This time you with the falchion rake it
out of the air
 A few moments pass as you guys glance around
the area to take in whether or not theres some
danger You manage to pull off the pincer from
around your body
 She looks back from the inside and goes
 The lip quiver

 She looks back and goes Theres a cluster
of seaweed inside Steps into the interior
doesnt enter the entire structure but steps in
the middle waiting for any sort of direction from
you guys
 Make a nature check for me if you dont
mind
 Looking at the seaweed in this interior it
is of the same variety as that which is clustered
around the rest of this tower It is not similar
from what you can tell to what you encountered at
Dashillas lair in the Divers Grave Youre not
certain if it has any interest in you guys but it
doesnt seem to be reacting to your presence
 Make a persuasion check
 Life needs love to live
 What are the rest of you doing
 As you guys take a short rest you can use
your hit dice to heal up
 Sure Make a perception check at first
 Okay Then make an investigation check
 Thats better Looking around the interior
there doesnt appear to be any trap doors or
anything thats hidden amongst the space Theres
the heavy clusters of seaweed that fill up along
the walls and it largely obscures when you look
up you can see because its dark inside aside
from the light thats there At the very top of
the tower where the light tends to fade you see
the open circular top where the faint bit of blue
light from the sky above comes through the ocean
You can see all the different slowlywaving
tendrils of seaweed cluttering up a lot of that
space The center area you glance over and you
can see where that big mass of seaweed and
underwater plant life is Along the edge of where
it is you prod it and it softly gives a little
bit past the floor
 The tendrils that are from its head that you
saw trailing behind it are as long as the length
of its body Theres about  of them that drift
behind it though theyre all limp now and it
just lies there destroyed Its wearing an old
slightly tattered robe who knows how ancient
Thats as much detail as you can make off of it
other than its jaws limply hanging open these
dull lifeless flaps where you can see the toothy
interior of its mouth as it hangs
 Make an investigation check
 Look at that Change your group name to The
Mighty Four here today
 I know Well youre all a little busted
about that previous battle No pockets no
keepsakes It looks like its pretty plainly
adorned
 You go over and look A lot of this is
theres roots around the edge of it where some of
the plant has rooted itself to the stone floor of
this temple but theres large portions of it that
go beyond those roots Upon pushing on it it has
some give below that central area It looks like
theres some sort of opening or a space below the
center
 No
 Its pretty gross
 Make an investigation check
 As Jester said no pockets no trinkets
Nothing on it but the tattered robe its wearing
and its weird somewhat almost dolphinlike
rubbery flesh
 You guys drag its body back over to the
tower base
 Thats okay Whats up Whatre you guys
doing Youve taken a short rest
 Okay The seaweed itself is pretty knotted
and tangled and twisted around itself As the Mage
Hand gives and pulls it very softly releases its
hold on the other tendrils and pulls apart like
someone sweet talked a bit of it Its still
tangled and still a lot of it there but its not
holding taut You imagine that someone could
probably climb through it
 Okay As you reach out and your hand grasps
the edge of the seaweed it moves with your touch
and drifts a bit Its seaweed
 Okay You dive in and pull your way through
Reaching up youre now in an inverse state What
is up is down as you pull yourself below and
upward sifting and yanking through and finding
sections where you have to pull and find a space
Thankfully youre the smallest of the troupe so
its not as hard for you You begin to descend
ten   feet or so and the seaweed isnt dissipating
 Its just dark You have darkvision but
right now all you can see is clusters of seaweed
Its very Poltergeist in a way as youre pulling
your way through
 About  feet down your hands reach
through The small tunnel that youve been
clambering through below opens up on the sides
You glance and look inside and you appear to be
in some sort of a spherical chamber roughly about
 feet across side to side
 Youre at the top of it looking down There
are clusters of seaweed All around it theres
plant life thats embedded in aspects of it A
bunch of the seaweed is all coming up and tangling
towards the center to create this upward column of
plant matter
 Make a perception check
 Taking a moment very carefully eyeing the
space no signs of life Oh
 Two little fish
 Roll initiative against the death minnows
Yeah the place looks relatively empty beyond the
plant life that exists there
 There you go
 Everybody follows You all head down Its a
slimy climb Since youre all a little larger than
Nott especially Yasha theres a bit of
difficulty in pulling through At some points
Yasha angrily tears bits apart and starts making
her way down
 You all eventually manage to clamber
through slipping into the lower chamber All of
you get to see this large spherical chamber where
the wrapping seaweed spirals upward to fill that
space The structure is semifamiliar in size and
design to you Fjord
 Light fills the space You can now see
 Are you looking in the space Make a
perception check
 A lot of plant A lot of plant matter A bit
of stone
 Make an investigation check
  Ukotoa
 What did you roll
  investigation A few things catch your
eye As youre all having this conversation Caleb
dives towards the bottom and begins rummaging
through the base of the seaweed to look on the
base The first thing you notice is theres a
skeleton
 Yes A skeleton that is wrapped in leather
armor The bones of the skeleton you could see a
lot of mineral deposits have gathered around it
where the skeleton looks weirdly swollen A lot of
buildup on it like youve seen those sunken ships
that look lumpy You find that The leather armor
is pristine but the skeleton is fucked You also
see clustered around the base there numbers of
small shiny bits of material that the light that
gold platinum copper silver You look and
rummage in the one side You find a glass vial
that is tangled in weeds that has a dull
swirling bluegray color to it thats thick You
pull it out and its still stopped and kept You
fullon Terminatorscanned the base of this area
You glance over and other people are watching
Caleb as he starts rummaging through and finding
there is a collection down here There is a
sixinchwide thick glass sphere that appears to
be empty thats resting on the ground as well
 Yeah It was rolled into and wrapped around
by some of the local plant life You do see as
well a small green piece of stone carved to look
like a feather almost but its made of a deep
jade or green stone and a small piece of agate
stone that catches your eye mostly covered in
grime You rub off and polish it You can see the
agate stone from beneath it
 Agate stone skeleton
 Ill show you
 And plenty of coins As you are rummaging
through the coins and you shift through where the
glass sphere was it rolls off the side Beneath
where it settles with much of the coins you can
see a lot of coins are filling the space but
theres a little bit of a divot roughly about the
size of half a fist in the floor
 No The sphere that you found is larger It
wouldnt fit It was resting in the space It has
grime around it You rub it off a bit
 Its a seethrough glass
 The skeleton as well
 Okay You guys start gathering and shoveling
coins into your pockets and pouches and
everything Both of you guys make investigation
checks for me to glean how much you can find
amongst the tangled seaweed
 How long are you taking Are you going until
you cant find any more It would take you about
 minutes to do it Its a lot of coins
 Okay You guys keep searching What are the
rest of you doing
 The armor is studded leather Its well
made Theres a bunch of black sediment and
general slime and grime from the red plant life
thats gathered around the various plates of it
that are fastened together but it rubs off
relatively easily Its well made
 Make an investigation check for me
 It looks fairly plain As you pull it up
the bones snap and the skull tumbles off of the
neck and spinal cord As that happens you glance
on the inside While it looks plain on the
outside on the inside of the shoulder and the
back of the plate you can see faintly pressed runes
 Not really
 Make a medicine check
 Yeah Youre the one whos asking
 Ill give it to you
 You each get to roll as you take a look at
it Game the system
 What did you roll
 Okay Looking at it the lower parts of the
ribcage on the inside as well as the hips and the
pelvis of the skeleton are crushed You look at
some of the crushed bones and you pull it back
you can see scrapes across the bone like edges of
something sharp that had crushed through it also
had some sort of an edge to it
 Yeah
 Oh youve grabbed the leather armor Okay
You guys all make your way up and begin to clamber through
 I do
 All right As you all ascend and vanish from
sight leaving Fjord and Frumpkin behind you look
down upon the base of this interior chamber the
same recess that you had met before at Urukayxl
beneath the temple of the yuanti You can see
now that youre surveying it by yourself standing
over it the hints of the same spiral grooves that
all emerge from it in the similar pattern as the
one you previously saw carving up the walls and
meeting the upper area with the faint bits of
runes occasionally visible along the same form of
prisonenchantment placed on this chamber as the
one youve already seen
 Okay As you place the sword pommel down
into the center of that recess the eye glows
glows Your vision goes dark and dark to black
Flash of bright yellow light Your eyes wince
though you force them open Looking ahead of you
you can see a bright yellow eye the size of your
body staring towards you emitting this painful
glow the singular dark slit from top to bottom
focusing and twitching in your direction before it
finds you Watching You hear a deafening crack
and though your eyes are still adjusting to the
light before you and focusing intently on this
eye on the peripheral around it you can just
barely make out shifting shadows like tendrils or
movement Something serpentine beginning to shift
It seems to be resisting some sort of binds
 Making gains on them Adapt A
loosened tendril curls behind you You dont
change your focus looking at the eye You feel
like an icy blanket this scalylike tail almost
as large as your body begin to wrap around you
The touch is freezing ice cold and you feel your
back arch It begins to envelop and squeeze you
Reward The cold sensation overwhelms your
senses Your entire body goes numb and your vision
begins to blur once more The light of the eye
begins to fade as the cold sensation and the grasp
of this tendril becomes the entirety of your
awareness You hear a distant sound of muffled
cracking again As the blackness claims your
midnight before you Waves curl against this
shore this long protracted beach with just a
faint bit of starlight in the night giving you
just the basic outline of it Along that beach
you see three points of light different from
what your previous vision was Theyre not bright
singular points but three focused gathering of
dull lights You glance over Theyre cities
cities at night three of them along the shore
Beyond that a faint bit of yellow grabs your
attention Beyond these three coastal cities you
see a forest jungle You cant make out the
details from this strange elevated vantage point
You feel like youre flying above the sky The
light grows brighter and its the same tint as
the eye that summoned you here as the spheres
that youve claimed through your journey Above
that forest you see looming the peak of a
mountain range As that light grows brighter and
brighter in the heart of this jungle you hear
once more Release The light gets brighter
until it begins to hurt your eyes Youre trying
to focus on it trying to will yourself towards
it and it gets too much and you force your eyes
shut The minute you open them youre back in the
chamber Your body is pins and needles as the
numbness begins to fade You glance down The
yellow sphere that was at the base of your sword
the eye is just the dull lifeless metal that was
there when you first found the falchion All the
runes suddenly begin to glow with that same
yellow faint light The spirals all around you
The stone shifts again and cracks and you see
bits of stone and leftover sediment begin to
release within the inside of the chamber
 Okay The rest of you up top all of a
sudden you feel this seismic activity around the
base of this
  A second one You can see now
previously these very difficulttofind runes
that were filled in with bits of dust and sand and
muck that had gathered begin to burst up and
reveal the same yellow runes that you had seen
previously in the temple light up the chamber
around where the hydra battle took place
 No apparent connection from what you can
tell However as the second impact hits the
tower 
 Yeah
 Okay You guys all begin to leave What
order Whos going first
 Okay youre next
 Doesnt matter youre being pushed
through
 Jester and Beau I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws and you as well Fjord
as you make it going through the top
  points of bludgeoning damage as bits of
the stone knock you around You take half of that
so you only take seven Whatd you roll Fjord
 You rolled a seven so you take the 
points as well As you manage to move through the
space and just as Fjord you emerge and the rest
of you begin to make your way outside of the
temple you hear this low rumble You watch as
some of the rubble that was tumbling inside
suddenly begin to push upward The current of
water around you begins to change in an odd way
like theres a sudden suction you werent
expecting and all of you begin to be drawn
towards the temple once more All the seaweed
begins to tear loose and be thrust upward There
is a geyser bursting from the chamber below where
you once were and its causing this vacuum thats
pulling you up with it All of you make strength
saving throws please to try and grab something
in the vicinity
 You can if youd like to
 A lot of you may be yes
 Yeah you guys are being pulled back towards
the temple
 Okay Ill allow that Dont even have to
make saving throws As you all begin to be pulled
into it this vacuum as the geyser is tearing up
you watch as the temple that was collapsing is now
being pulled up and bits of the stone are being
thrust up into the sky above it into the top of
the ocean All of you feel the immense drag and
then it laxes again and you turn around and see
Jester sitting there arms out forcing the will
of the ocean around to hold tight and still around you
 All of you begin to rise up at a rocketing
speed towards the surface of the ocean As the
water passes by you manage to all emerge from the
top The speed that youre at now that you know
its coming you manage to do your best to slow
your descent and land carefully I wont make you
roll for any damage As you all land you hear
this  sound as you glance over in the
direction off the side of where that temple top
would have been There is a geyser shooting a
hundred feet in the air Bits of rock are being
thrown like volcanic bombs in different
directions and then  it loses
its force and power eventually coming to rest
and the ocean is no longer spraying into the air
 The ships maybe a few hundred feet from
where you were
 You guys jog your way towards the ship You
see somebody off the side notice you and start
shouting to the rest of the crew at which point
the sails are unfurled a bit and as you guys make
your way towards the edge they throw the rope
ladders and you all begin to climb your way back
onto the Balleaters deck
 You sense that lingering pinsandneedles
hasnt quite faded entirely Theres a buzzing
energy about you
 Its something connected to the ocean
Something connected to water
 Borrowing from the imagery that youve seen
with Avantikas attempts at shaping and
manipulating the waters that surround her
 Correct As you will the water to follow
and you guys watch this as well it extends in a
tendril and wraps up to the edge of the ship and
seems to be awaiting a command
 Orly at this point has rushed up and is
like Captain where we going
 All right and begins shouting out
commands and you hear a voice shouting out from
the crows nest Marius LePual Captain Ship
sighted and you see him pointing off to the
side You guys glance towards the southern
archipelago island and at the edge of one of the
cliff sides where there is a waterfall and a bit
of the forest gathered there the front of a boat
is emerging from what is a previouslyunseen
seaside cave
 And thats where were going to take our
break

 Yes you may
 All you saw was him place the sword in the
spot there was a flash of light from where it
was and he was immediately There was no time
passage
 Correct Well be right back here to see
what happens here for the next bit

of the fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway tonight is
Drinscorpio Drinscorpio congratulations Well
get your info and get that sent to you ASAP but
well done
 Oh no
 Does it smell like durian
 You ever see those super spiked Asian
fruit
 All righty As you all get onto the ship and
Orly begins to make the course you hear Marius
LePual shouting from the crows nest that there is
a ship emerging You turn it and look towards the
southern island of the archipelago and see
emerging from a seaside cave that you had not
noticed upon entry the front of a ship the bow
piercing the edge and making its way towards you
 You dont know You can wait and find out
What are you doing
 Okay All right the sails begin to drop
begin to pick up the wind and make your way which
direction East north
 Northeast would be the way
 All right Making that route youre giving
the direction the sails pick up and the ship
begins moving As the ship turns around the corner
and youre glancing as it makes its way in your
direction no colors flying Similar size if a
little bit smaller than your ship
 Correct
 There is a spyglass on board as part of the
equipment
 You may Make a perception check with
advantage
 Mmhmm
 Yeah with the spyglass
 Okay As you glance off to the side you can
see the ship There appears to be a crew waiting
on deck scattered amongst the edges of it
looking over Maybe six people you can see
Theyre all dressed in drab dark grays and blacks
and greens Sails fully open at this point and
you do notice that there are gunports on it four
gunports on the side that you can see that are
being opened currently
 Correct no flags
 At this point from what you can gather as
youre turning around and heading in that
direction because you were towards that southern
island for the place in between the three of them
where you found its maybe about at this point
 or so feet away from you
 You are taking down some of the crew to
begin manning the guns
 All right You have the special officer
action on the lower left area
 Theres also one here for the captain and
the first mate
 With the statistics for your ship As we are
currently
 The cannons you have here are  short
range foot long range
 The top two The only person that gets the
bottom action is you because youre the master gunner
 Are you guys fleeing or are you engaging
 Your crew takes care of the loading for you
but you as the master gunner every round can
give that benefit to one of the cannons that are
being fired
 Its hilarious how that game came out this
year and this has been our adventure
 Its helped me learn a lot
 You have seven There were eight but one of
them got damaged
 It should tell you you have
 Right now because youre perpendicular to
them youre going to have to turn to make that
motion which is how theyre able to start gaining
on you You do have some lead time
 Right now no Youre facing where the ship
was when you got on in a southeast way so youre
going to have to turn to make your way that way
but you can You still have a little bit of gain
on them
 Right now they are on the starboard side
yes Starboard bow
 Each of you can do one of these on your turn
for the round once we engage in any sort of
shiptoship combat but right now you guys are
too far away You choose now you can either
choose to engage or you can choose to try and
outrun them
 All right so are you giving the Full Speed
Ahead action essentially
 Okay The sails unfurl the ship begins to
turn making its way towards port side arcing
northeast to try and pick up the wind and begin to
gain slow speed The other ship has turned and is
making its way in your path and is gaining speed
rapidly It was prepared for your arrival and it
took you guys a minute to get everyone engaged to
go ahead and start shoving off Its closed the
distance to about a thousand feet over the time it
takes you to start get everything ready to go
and head in that direction Like I said it is
smaller probably faster and its crew are looking
to try and catch up and engage
 Well find out Lets go ahead and roll
initiative guys
 For all of you and the boat has its own
initiative
 Yeah you could just hang out if you want
 Thats true
 Oh the ship did well with a 
 You guys however not so great Thats a
six for you guys
 All right  to  guys
  to 
 All righty  to ten
 All righty
 And then whos left its Yasha But yeah
she
 All right Anyway
 I did
 No their ship is  you guys got a six
 Their ship had a  All right anyway
The ships are moving Theyre too far away for you
to fire In giving the orders to move you guys
are managing to stay pretty neck and neck as far
as travel for the moment
 Maintaining a fair distance As you head
northeast just passing beyond the island to the
east side of you pushing outside of the
archipelago the wind begins to die a little bit
and your speed slows So does theirs it seems
But it doesnt Their sails maintain up
 Their sails do
 Its been more than ten minutes since you
guys shoved off though
 Ill show you
 Well say for the purposes of distance Im
putting this down because its more interesting to
look at than just a table But well say
 Well say this is them Well say this is
you guys about a thousand to  feet away Let me
see what can I use here for landmasses Sure
thatll work Well say as youre coming around
here this is the island You guys are heading
this is north this is east and youre coming
through this space here Well use this here as
the other island as youre moving past well say
 Okay As you guys maneuver and tend to hang
in close making your way in towards the island
they do gain a little bit of distance I need you
to make a survival check as you are currently
leading the ship to try and avoid any sort of
heavy rocks and things along the side of the island
 Hes the captain unfortunately yeah
 Ooh That puts you at a thats a three
total
 Yeah so three Okay Heading towards the
side there pushing a little close in to the
island Immediately you hear  Not
enough to damage the hull to a serious point but
it does suffer two points of slashing damage
well say across the hull
 It is
 Moving forward it manages to dislodge from
the rock suffering another six points of slashing
damage You manage to pull off the rock Noticing
this jutting the other ship rolls better and
manages to avoid
 No They are still gaining though Theyre
about  feet away
 Are you guys continuing straight
 All this shifts over this way As you guys
continue to hug the side they gain to about 
feet  feet
 What do you do
 So Control Water Youre too far away from
the beach to push them onto the beach itself You
have  feet from them but theyre still about
 or  feet out from any sort of sandbank that
would impact them There are rocks in the
vicinity so Ill consider that a little bit of a
benefit to the chance of capsizing
 Youre attempting to capsize the ship 
percent chance Ill make that a  percent
chance Roll a percentage die for me if you dont
mind As you guys watch as Caduceus concentrates
 The first one
 Yes so roll what Yeah
 You watch as the ocean  swells up
and slams into the ship The ship collision and
rumbling capsizes and scrapes onto the edge of a
bank of heavy rocks
 Im going to get rid of that initiative
order thats not going to do anything now
 Set aside all these great
 Yeah You gather as you begin to turn the
ship around and watch their ship they do not have
anything to right it from being capsized against a
bunch of jagged rocks
 Yeah For the purposes of brevity
 No dont apologize Thats what this shits
for That was a  percent chance for an immediate
win and you did it
 As you turn around and prepare the cannons
you see the top half of the sideways ship begin to
sift over to where the actual base of the hull and
the cargo hold is now visible at the top Bits of
the masts have snapped and are now floating with
the sails in the ocean You can see a few people
that are starting to scramble out from underneath
as you let loose a volley of cannon fire on it
You can roll those attacks if youd like to
 Three attacks but the first one has
additional damage
 Is it all to the hull Thats most of what
you can see right now Was it    you said
 The first two  The
third one slams into the hull Roll damage
 Thankfully most of this was available as an
Unearthed Arcana in DD and I did my own tweaks
About an hour wasted
  points of damage You splinter into the
hull which has already taken a shitton of
damage Yeah the ships fucked Sorry Mike
Mearls We tried to play with it a little more

 Nah

 You can see shards of wood all scattered in
the area around it and the boat is sinking
Between the impact of being capsized by the wave
the blast of the cannon fire and the fact that
youre so close to the edge of the island put it
in a position where it cant right itself
 Make a perception check
 There are seven swimming survivors
 Well let me put my papers away
 Dont apologize That was awesome Thats
how you do it
 As youre shouting over the edge the ones
that you can see theyre mostly raggedylooking
human neerdowells They look like theyve
probably been at sea for a while skin tanned and
burned in places There is one tabaxi among them
that is the only one thats actually responding to
anything youre saying She goes Bring us
aboard Show mercy Shes swimming and trying
the water is thrashing her around
 Do you bring up all seven survivors
 I dont know how many do you have
 Are you firing the cannons
 Everything that was on the ship aside from
the cannons
 Yeah you got one
 One by one you pull the waterlogged
wayfarers that were on the opposite ship They all
get back onto the dock and look particularly
frustrated angry They seem to be sizing each of
you up with their eyes as they all take a place a
begrudgingly subservient position until
eventually the tabaxi gets up climbs and shakes
this widebrimmed black velvet hat that looks
stained and fucked up from the sea water There
was a large feather plume on it that looks like
its snapped in the middle and hanging Shes
like Ugh Well done You cheated the hell out of
that but what do you want of us
 Well because you wandered into the middle
of the archipelago and seemed to be easy pickings
What else
 The tabaxi which wears a very calico fur
coloring head turns to the side and goes The what
 One of the other pirates goes up and puts a
hand on the shoulder and goes Its okay
Captain We got taken out by the Balleater

 The tabaxis eyes narrow Are you the
captain of this vessel
 And your name is
 I am Captain Serack Feng
 Feng
 Well you have managed to sink the
 the Salty Criss
 The captain looks back over and it is gone
Its beneath the waves Well not anymore but we
have our lives and a third of our crew
 A third of our crew
 Theyre not here are they
 It caught our attention
 They all wince at the idea Could you maybe
leave us on the island
 What do you think small one
 Aye aye captain The ship begins to make
its way towards the edge Since youre not in the
middle of a rush here you take some time to find
what looks like the way to get close to the beach
Are you lending them a rowboat or tossing them
into the ocean
 
 The tabaxi turns towards the four men who
havent jumped overboard yet Hey Levar Youre
up and then jumps off Hes like Oh
 Theres a fair canvas of varying levels of
faded tattoos that mark shoulders and forearms
Theyre all really wellmade
 Thank you
 You can see the soaked ratty gray shirt
He pulls it up and the entire body is tattooed
from wrist
 Put it right there
 Sure fine do it Just get it over with
 Roll a dexterity check
 You produce a fairly successful clean
tattoo of your intended design
 
 He jumps off the side of it  At
this point now its starting to get closer to
dusk They all swim to the shore Theyve begun
assembling whatever scraps they can from the
nearby tree line to start building a small camp
for the night What do you guys want to do
 Aye aye Captain If I might ask what
business are we looking for in Brokenbank
 No stopping
 If anyones sick
 There seem to be decent supplies You
stocked up at Bisaft Isle and you have magical
means of creating food if you need it
 Are you asking Orly You know Brokenbank
Its the first
 For many of the shipping lanes its the
first port of entry to give your paperwork to
show what youre bringing in to make sure its
all approved and going through Its part of the
process of things making their way into port
 Fair enough He goes ahead and starts making
his way that direction From the archipelago to
Nicodranas without stops looks to be between five
and six days travel
 Thatll bring you down to about four and a
half well say Yeah between all of you guys
being able to juggle that around Okay
 You may
 My Jester youre coming back Well I
dont know specifically but there does not appear
to be a manhunt Just be careful
 Okay Yeah because you rolled really high
on that investigation check What are the five things
 Correct No coin from the ship However you
did manage to muster in the time that you
gathered beneath there  copper pieces
 Overall You can divide as you see fit If
you choose not to divide I can give you
individual amounts
  silver pieces
  gold pieces
  platinum pieces
 In the background from over the side
 No you see this little turtle head go
Heh
 If theres any other business you want to
take care of during this fourandahalfday journey
 Wuyun Gorge
 Nope everything was removed at Darktow
 You look and see there is still the single
eye thats always been in the middle of the hilt
since your encounter with the merrow that first
found it
 That glass sphere that you found beneath
you watch as Caleb speaks the command word
 It rocks and lifts off the ground and hovers
and gives off a nice soft white torchlightlike glow
 Yeah its probably evening
 Suddenly it gives off this extremely
powerful vibrant daylight The entire ships deck
feels like its suddenly midday
 Just once
 foottall tree yeah
 Or fuck up somebodys ceiling really bad
 Yeah whenever you want to it can transform
to any outfit you want
 Anyones melee attacks any of your strength
checks For an hour someones strength becomes badass
 No
 No lasts for one hour
 For this add your proficiency bonus for the
forgery kit as well as your dexterity to attempt
to actually for this Use intelligence This
isnt copying documents this is forging
documentation that seems to
 Were doing intelligence because this is
trying to create verbiage and documentation that
you think will seem officious and believable
 He can aid you and you can have advantage on
the roll if he wants to help
 It gives you a mote of possibility but it
is the dodecahedron
 Crystal box whatever you want to call it
 Intelligence and proficiency bonus
 Correct
 Okay you roll one more d
 Using Calebs aid and the time you have on
the ocean waiting for periods of relatively calm waters
 Its all good You do manage to create a
number of documents that both declare the
ownership of the ship create a false log of
various journeys that youve taken in the ship as
well as forging a few signatures of individuals at
Brokenbank that have checked in the ship in the
past Whose name is it under
 Mmhmm
 Captain I couldnt possibly You see him
really wrestling with the idea I can certainly
caretake it in your absence You intending to
mmmosey on northward right
 He thinks for himself and goes Mmighty
generous I can claim ownership by name only but
we all know who the captain of this ship is If
youre going upward to the Empire I can put the
crew to work Earn a little bit of money for us
and you When you come on back may be a little
bit of gold in it for you But the ship is always
yours
 Mmhmm
 First name doll
 Skiffback
 Anyway goodnight He turns around makes
his way
 You hear the heavy footfalls of him turning
around and slowly coming back to the chambers
Mmhmm
 Well you need the supplies
 I told you
 Baseline Then depending on the kind of
tattoo the cost tends to increase
 When you do happy to help
 No worryin Turns around and makes his
way back out
 The warm soft comforting voice like a
breeze drifts past your ears as the hot wind
unexpectedly through a cold night drifts past
your shoulders Staying out of sight Making
amends Thats all
 All right
 Okay Is there anything else you wish to do
during this travel or are we going to bring us in Nicodranas
 Okay Well go ahead and keep that in
consideration Itll take you a little bit most
of the trip Itll help you for a while You might
want to keep it with you just as a reference point
 All right cool You spend the rest of the
trip working together to try and memorize it to
the best of your ability It is a complicated
b Theres layers to it but you manage to get the
broad strokes of it and you can keep that with
you if you want to
 All right
 Yeah no worries
 Okay Go ahead and make an animal handling
check for me
 Okay Sprinkles still a little skittish
after some of the experiences on the seas but
seems to have gotten a little more comfortable
Thankfully there isnt a lot of chaos since you
guys left the archipelago Over the next few days
Sprinkle seems to take to it for the button and
the bits of food and treats that you provide so
you seem to have taught a simple trick to your weasel
 On the Balleater Anything else
 After a few days journey tending to your
various bits of business eventually the familiar
sound of seagulls gathered near the coast meets
your ears on the warm sunny morning As you wake
up and glance up into the light of day past the
stairs that lead to the deck you can see the
familiar sight of the harbor of Nicodranas There
the familiar visual of the Mothers Lighthouse
greeting you in towards the bay Caduceus you
cant help be but overtaken with that comforting
welcome sense and you swear for a minute you see
her glance in your direction but you blink Hmm
that was strange You prepare your papers and make
your way in towards one of the various openings
across the harbor Well pick up there next week
as it is getting late
 That was funny
 No Ive been sitting on that rule set while
you guys are at sea
 Mike Mearls at Wizards he did this
Unearthed Arcana a while back in November for
those whenever it comes up I did some adjustments
will no Well maybe if they no Well see if
Avantika escapes and they chased No she died
Okay well theyre going to the archipelago and
there is okay cool No Okay well Were back
in Nicodranas You guys get to try out the rules
and tell me how that went Its funny Anyway
welcome back I missed you guys I missed the
game We missed you guys Well be back next
Thursday Then well see some of you guys at the
art exhibit here in LA next weekend as well
 Its going to be a crazy week
 If you arent by now Laura youve got no
excuse by now Well see you guys back here next
Thursday Until then have a wonderful week We
love you and is it Thursday yet Goodnight

 So last we left off The Mighty Nein after
finishing their journey to the secondary temple of
Ukotoas sealing managed to deliver the second
of the collected orbs and bring him one step
closer to his release You then exited back to
your ship which another ship was found to be
giving chase apparently notified by your presence
from the large geyser that erupted from the ocean
due to the unsealing A short chase then
commenced leading to a much shorter battle
 Yeah All said and done hearing rumors
about possible dangers continuing to push deeper
into the empire from the Xhorhasian hordes you
begin to make your way back towards the direction
of the empire Getting your things in order
youve made your way back through the Swavain
Islands and you are just now entering
the port of Nicodranas
 As you approach Mighty Nein what would you
like to do Theres a person on the deck right now
whos waving down and bringing you in bringing
out a spyglass to check your banner your ship
name It looks like youre probably going to be in
the process of checking in shortly
 Wharfmaster Ignus
 Okay all right Anybody else changing their
appearance upon entry
 You got it
 What different color
 Okay All right
 Understood
 Yasha accepts does not really care to see
what it looks like but just trusts your opinion
  Avantikas coats
dont have sleeves
 You guys are pulled into the Restless Wharf
You are brought into the side the ship is brought
up against the dock a couple of dockhands start
to go on and help get the ship pulled in tied
off Planks are put down Ignus eventually comes
back over and goes All right so tell me
what is your ship Paperwork please
 Captain Tristan
 At this point behind Orly leans in
Captain wasnt there a plan to run
business in your stead
 Orly takes it Here you are Hands it over
to the Wharfmaster Steps away for a minute goes
and checks everything eventually comes back
Thats the Wharfmaster Misfires finally
 He comes back Paperwork is all fine All
right we will be talking He points to Orly and
Orly gives him a nod Looks back at the rest of
you Well you all be safe Even if you got some
of that fancy mmmagic word stuff right
 I can too probably
 Yall travel safe
 You watch as Marius off the side hands
something to Orly and Orly looks off to you all
Dont worry I fully intend to
and puts a captain hat on
 Marius makes a note With that you guys
have made your way back to Nicodranas The
bustling streets are there Its early afternoon
There are a bunch of people currently dealing with
shipments being taken out of ships put back into
ships As when you were coming in theres a
number of naval vessels in the outskirts of the
harbor as well Its a busy time of the day but
no one seems to be paying you too much mind The
zhelezo are present havent gotten thicker
immediate arrival but youre still nervously
keeping an eye out though you have no real
conspicuous presentation other than Beau
So what would you like to do
Where are you off to
 Okay
 You can make a history check As you
however have not spent a lot of time traveling
around Nicodranas as much as you grew up here
you stayed indoors most of the time
 You know of a really good one in Zadash
 Make a history check
 You have not been to a bookstore
necessarily Most of the books that you had were
brought to you by your mom but you could probably
wander around and find one eventually
 Okay are you guys beelining it to a
bookshop then
 Whos going to the blacksmith Team
blacksmith you begin to wander through the
streets asking questions around Eventually some
of the local zhelezo lead you over to the place
called Ingots and Hammers It seems to be a humble
size but this isnt a very big smithing town
necessarily In fact one of them you speak to
goes like Port Zoon would be more the place to
go if youre looking for good brawny blacksmiths
but there is Ingots and Hammers maybe They head
you over in that direction The exterior of it
most of it the heavy stone base of the building
its a standard rectangle most of it open on the
side facing the street so you can see the smoke
from the forge itself pouring out It doesnt have
a specific chimney built more than it billows out
in two places to create these two drifting streams
that head up As you walk up you can see there
isnt immediately work being done It looks like
perhaps there is a midafternoon break and you do
see a tan skinned heavyset burly looking fellow
human smooth bald head a split lip that healed
back and it has this big scar piece that gives him
a little bit of character and he sits there in
the middle of eating a bowl of fruit and glances
up at you Hello Can I help you
 Let me see it He sets down his bowl and
walks over Oh Just a second hold on Sets it
down and rummages through a small shelf unit in
the back and pulls out a few books and pulls out
one tome opens it up and sets it down and begins
thumbing through page to page Takes about five
six minutes to find something before he stops and
goes My apologies This is not really a form of
forging that I can repair This is Uthudurnian
 Its a very far north very isolated
people Dual society dwarves and elves together
 Merger of the two styles of forging make
for very unique weaponry but a little bit
out of my skill range My apologies
 Its north of the Empire
 Up in them Wildlands
 Yes thats the place
 Happy to help Wish I could be of
assistance I could use the coin but good luck
 Three gold he goes Thank you very much
You are very generous thank you Thank you all
 Dreef
 Dreef Whats your name
 Beau
 Do you use staffs
 No itd be really funny if you used
them and you do so thats quite funny
 That is what Im talking about
  Yeah
 Wait He turns around and rushes off
real fast to rummage in the same cabinet and
comes back with piece of ribbon then
leans in to tie it around the bo
  Youre not into this Im sorry
 The ribbons for you I suppose
 Anyway Have a good day
 Good luck He sits down and takes his bowl
back on his lap and watches you intensely as you leave
 All right Bookshop farers
 About then you pick up a visual on a
cornershop thats called Front to Back and has
books hanging underneath that
on a little wooden placard
 You step inside Its a smaller building and
theres no other customers its actually pretty
quiet in there The only sound you hear is a
silent purring from the owners cat Its curled
up on one of the shelves and its  As
soon as you enter and make your first creaking
step against the floorboard one eye pokes open
 stretches out stands up and looks at
you all and then turns around
and just walks away
 Oh the cat was a calico All splotches of
brown dark brown black Halfandhalf nose
Theres three shelves on the left side the right
side is just a window its open and what little
bit of light is in there is the daylight being let
in its filling the space of this warm interior
There is a desk towards the back where you see a
scrawny scrappylooking man in his late s or
early s His hair is combed back slicked but
little pieces of it are falling in front of his
eyes He has a little bit of scruff on his upper
lip not enough to actually be considered a
mustache He glances up from a book that hes in
the middle of reading and goes Hello Look
around anything you want Im Rusan Anything
that you may require let me know Pay at the front
 
 Rusan
 This is a lot of questions Hold on He
sits there and has to file through in his head for
a second There is paper of course We have
very nice parchment for presentation for events
parties invitations if thats what youre
looking for As far as books we have all sorts
of it The front shelf here is mainly discussions
on various cultural philosophies There is also
a number of cooking manuals if youre interested
in that There are an entire part of fiction that
deals with fictional accounts of the various
gods of the various Marquis the Empires rise
That seems to be very popular among the visiting
crownsguard I mean theres a lot of things
Are you looking for something in particular
 That is a bit specific unfortunately We
do not have anything in particular for that
 I do not unfortunately Most of that is
organized by the guildmasters under the Marquis
The Concord generally deals with things that are
of particular price points and interests I mainly
deal with people who come to travel in and out
people that want something to read when they are
going on a boat for a very long time Theres not
a lot of business to be made from the books you requested
 Have you been published
 Keep at it
 Hey He leans forward and pats you on the
shoulder Everyone starts somewhere right
 Correct
  gold I mean to equivalent
to fill up that much ink
 Correct Yeah He has a fair amount of
paper Some of it he seems to have to leave for a
few minutes and then come back with it He seems
to be going off and probably buying it from other
friends of his Like the time I remember as a kid
I ordered a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant
and it took  minutes to get there
and I realized it was because
they went up the street to get it
 I was a dumb yearold Anyway
 With typical ink or magic ink
 Okay Just checking Okay You find one
fictional piece that talks of a sailors tryst
Two sailors two separate ships that continuously
meet up at different island ports throughout the
Swavain Islands eventually finding themselves on
Revelry and one that is part of the Clovis
Concords naval fleet Yet these two sailors
eventually come together and find that this conflict
was not enough to keep their passions apart
 You find a book about the history of
Nicodranas and Ill email you information after
the game I dont want to sit here and
 Yes Ill send that to you
 Which one There are many types There are
ones that focus on various ways of steaming and
spicing vegetables from Marquet There are ones
about the actual coastal tropical fruits that can
be prepared in a way that is more savory than
sweet What is your preference
 A pastry book That can be done of course
That will be He goes and looks through his
ledger goes and pulls one off of the shelf comes
by This will be two silver pieces
 There are a few that contain
mushrooms Im sure I can look around
 Any preference I mean there are
locationwise
 Okay Ill pick one All right
that will be four silver
 There you are Your cinnamon pastry
and mushroom book Enjoy
 No worries Well good luck
and keep it up my friend
 Thats right Each book is two silver
pieces so thats four silver pieces for that For
the total amount of paper that is going to
run you about well say  gold pieces
 Its a lot of paper
 Its like feeding an endless printer
 or those dollar counter
machines that go 
 Mark off another level one spell slot
 I love it Its so good As you guys finish
your business you all eventually come and
reconvene Unless you have other business you want
to attend to while youre out and about
 Plenty of patches of dirt I would
say in the streets
 If you go a little bit out of your way
yes you can find a patch of
 As your fingers dig into the dirt and you
squeeze it and appreciate it you glance over to
the side Theres a sevenyearold boy
whos sitting there looking at you
 He reaches down and grabs a big handful of
dirt too and squishes it in his fingers
 Yeah
 
 A strange little pink creature with
fairy wings just threw dirt in his eye
 If it pinks the knife sinks Eventually you
guys reconvene outside of the Lavish Chateau You
see Tyral the young man who had helped you with
your cart but does not recognize any of you
really Nods as you walk into the establishment
Its still early enough where the clientele
there is no presentation It is mainly a
relatively quiet midday dining experience There
are maybe three people in the interior and
theyre probably having business meetings There
might be merchants who are using this space as a
location away to have more hushed conversations
in a less public environment You have arrived
What would you like to do
 Make a perception check
 You do not see Professor Thaddeus
in the rafters
 I am sad theres a little part of me that
when you first got that owl and you made your
first animal handling check I was hoping you
would roll a one It would be like Go do this
 I was praying so hard
that would happen

 It would have been so on brand for Beau
 It just took a little longer for it happen
You head upstairs You make your way up the
staircase to the second floor then make your way
up towards where your mothers room is There as
you begin to step up the way you hear the heavy
footfall of Bluud who sits in the middle of the
top of the staircase towards where your mothers
room is Looks down towards you 
Leans back and folds his arms Are the rest of
you going up with her or staying down there
 You all head up Bluud puts his hand out this
 Leans back again his shoulders hitting
the wall as Jester does the classic
international symbol for let us through please
 Yeah You come to the door
 Knock on it Nadine opens it up Glances
recognizes you and goes Ah right Pulls the
door open Lounging in her fainting couch in the
far corner is your mother with a small book open
Her hair is pulled and tied back tightly shes in
her casual space She doesnt look like shes
expecting any clientele any time soon
She glances over and looks at
 Jester Oh my goodness Jester She puts
the book down and sits up and runs across and
picks you up with a big swinging hug
Starts showering the top of your forehead
Jester youre back
 Oh these are your same friends
 Right Welcome back friends welcome back
Thank you so much for taking care of my little sapphire
 Everything was fine I was a little worried
from the message that you told me so I inquired
around There was a disturbance Apparently
there was a ghost story so thank you for
letting me know But now you have a ghost
story in Nicodranas
 Apparently Be careful with that wording
you guys Best not to have too much attention
Especially in this world it can be
very dangerous
 No not what I could figure out at least
It was more of a marauding band of murderers on
the ship side of the docks that stole a ship but
apparently killed a number of other illegal
peoples and so they write it off as illegal
people doing illegal things to illegal people
 Just be careful Anyway
 Oh She goes and theres what used to be
your room with the double doors that close She
opens it up and pulls it open You can see all
these scratch marks on the inside of the wood The
immediate smell of dog shit and pee hits you
Nugget  All of a sudden right there
in front of you you see Nugget but larger Over
the weeks that youve gone the tiny puppy is now
a fairly decentsized puppy Halfway to full
grown and even thats the size of a fairly big
dog Nugget  and jumps up into your arms
and you fall back onto the ground as 
 Ive been training him as much as I can
Hes been a bit of a handful but is very adorable
 Hes slobbering on the chest of your armor
But are you taking him
 Wonderful Wonderful I am so happy to hear
that Hes missed his mommy havent you Havent you
 No No its quite all right
 Hes adorable but it is meant to be
It is destiny kismet Please take him
 Of course Of course I mean here
 Yeah oh of course Hold on a second She
pulls Nadine over and they talk a bit and Nadine
checks and comes back up and says that there are
only two rooms available for the evening that
arent already checked out She goes If anyone
needs to they are welcome to stay in this room as
well and the other two are at your disposal I
put them at my tab do not worry
 Just for the night
 Its not an imposition I just need
to make sure that there are rooms
available for each progressive night
 I mean I would not argue
 It is welcoming Well tell me
how was your time Apparently you
left under interesting circumstances
 I have heard of it There are stories
but I have not been there of course
 Oh wow Are you being serious right now
 I had one client from Darktow once
told me a little bit about it
Sounds like a very frightening place
 I cannot tell
 No
 No but that doesnt narrow down my
clients necessarily either
 Thats okay
 I assume that youre referring
to the Tidal
 Tide Peak Yes I have not been there
of course but it is a mysterious place
 Well as far as I know there is a very
wealthy mage who lives there who is responsible
for the organization of the Open Quay who is
kind of a hermit from what Ive heard but is
supposedly at least looking out for the benefit
of the people who live there so as not to be
completely under the control of the monopoly
of the Concord Thats as much as I know
 As an expert I would say yes Anyway
 You have been at sea for quite some time
I can tell
 It is all right Well take your time I
will ask to see if we can have a special dinner
prepared for you when you come back tonight
and Im happy to have you home
 At this point its later afternoon Id say you
probably have about another hour or so before dusk
 Make a perception check
 Really really great for the DM
 Sure Its called Hireling because that was
the first word I saw on the back of my DMs
screen Who knows what that storys about
 The first chapters called Obscured Areas

Lightly obscured has the effect of creatures

 If youre looking for general shops that
have things that are useful in travels like that
Healing potions I dont really deal with those at
all There is The Seafloors Bounty in the Open
Quay If youre planning to go by the strange dick
tower then that is a possibility If not there
there is also Meandering Treasures in the
Restless Wharf is a destination of interest
if thats what youre looking for
odds and ends maybe
 There is no specialty stores in healing
potions in Nicodranas
 All right Good luck
 You beat me to it Siri
 
 The dog immediately they both port in
opposite directions as he ports right up next to
you and pushes you over
 Frumpkin comes over slowly 
Frumpkin leaps up and perches around your
shoulders taking the territory and staring at
Nugget
 All right The rest of you where are you
going
 You have two locations you go to
 Heading to the Seafloors Bounty it seems
to be a fairly decent general store It
specializes in pawning scavenged goods and loot
and things that are found at sea or people come
upon through whatever means they come upon them
near the wharf There is a female gnome who runs
it Older looking the equivalent of a human s
which means shes been around for quite some time
but very crotchety and nasty As you walk in
theres one other customer who as soon as you
enter looks nervously and then exits immediately
brushes past you and disappears into the now
setting sun as the gnome turns around to you
Yeah can I help you
 Hello
 Hello
 She leans over the top to look down at your
alsotiny frame over the top You need potions
you said
 Oil
 I can get you some oil sure
 Maybe
 Thats the secret password Ill be right
back
 She leaps off her stool and vanishes behind
the counter You hear the footsteps walk away and
go into a back chamber and youre left alone on
the floor in the room for a second
 Theres all sorts of interesting Decorative
scabbards containing what you assume to be a blade
decorating the walls you can see large conch
shells and various sea trophies that were taken
from people making the journey all across the
Swavain Islands
 Make a perception check
 Theres a few shiny things
 Okay
 You cast Detect Magic
 Looking around in the room you get some
faint magical glow or a sense from behind the
counter Nothing on display Theres probably a
reason for that
 Are you going to look over behind the
counter
 Okay You glance over and look and tucked
underneath there is a small wooden case Its
closed currently It looks maybe about two foot by
one foot maybe six or seven inches high and
thats whats giving you the faint magical aura
 Okay A few moments pass and you hear some
more footsteps come in and another  onto
the stool again She steps up and she has a small
satchel that you hear the clanking of crystal or
glass on the inside Okay I have three healing
potions I could muster Is that what you want
 What
  gold apiece
 All right Pay up
 Just the three basic potions
 Theres oil How much do you need
 All right thatll run you  gold
pieces
 All right She jumps off the stool and
this takes a while You start hearing heavy
clanging of metal and things dropping in the back
You glance around the corner and theres a slight
curtain and it looks like shes just emptying out
lanterns into a vial Just pouring one after
another after another into this small jug and
eventually corking it Comes out Careful now
 Youre welcome Thank you
 Sheila
 Sheila Bobsnopper
 Bobsnopper
 Whats your question
 Nothing for sale sorry
 Not for show
 None of your business
 Trust me you dont want to be the kind of
person that comes in here and gets a chance to see it
 Maybe
 I dont play this game missy
 Are you casing my joint
 I said are you casing my joint
 What
 Are you 
 Yes I do What do you have something to
sell
 Oh Show it to me
 She reaches down and takes a cloth and
starts cleaning off the bits of grime and stuff on
it Takes a few minutes to inspect it the
interior seeing how it fits together and belts
Thats a good set not too bad For sale Let
me look at the price here  Studded
leather armor
 Ill give you  gold for it
 All right here you go
 So you take  gold back She goes and
throws it in a pile in the corner Is that it
Anything else She narrows her eyes at you
 Narrows even harder at you
 Im always tired Im just tired of you
coming in here being nosy Get your friends out
I like you You you can all piss off
 Bye bye
 Bobsnopper
 I love the prospect of you finally coming
back to Nicodranas and immediately just fucking
everything up again
 Do what you want mind you
 Why not embrace destiny
 Yeah Easy to find the tower is visible By
now at this point in time the sun is in the
process of setting so the sky has transitioned
now into its vibrant oranges and reds and across
the way on the other side of the horizon the dark
blues and purples are starting to take But there
it is the dark shadow of the monolithic tower of
Tide Peak visible The closer you get the taller
it becomes and the taller it becomes until what
looks to be maybe hundreds of floors up Its
absurd how tall it looks from the base floor
 Id say its maybe no more than  feet
across  feet wide
 That balcony is not visible
 Yeah
 Okay Yeah you go around and where the
balcony was last time theres nothing Its
solid In fact there are no windows for about 
or so feet up and then you see a balcony similar
to the one you saw but it is shorter like
truncated on each side
 About  or  feet up
 Dimplewood
 Its Whoa whoa unless youre watching
it the whole time So its like Oh well head
that way and you walk and all of a sudden
youre at the base and you look up and youre
like Whoa why is it so tall If youre
watching it which I imagine you probably were as
you were heading through the Open Quay its
pretty immediate meaning within about  feet or
so the transition really hits From any distance
in the city it just looks like any other large
tower though it looks like one of the more
visible and apparent ones across the skyline It
isnt until you get within  feet that all of a
sudden it drastically seems to grow
 Correct
 Metal is funny when it conducts heat Oh
Laura you okay
 I mean unless you havent gone with them
 Okay you knock on the wall
 It sounds like youre knocking on hard
stone and it hurts your knuckle a little bit
 At the moment nothing
 There is one that looks to be a small fish
market Its not huge by any means it looks like
its open but its probably going to be closing
fairly soon probably when the sun goes
 As youre doing that you hear a door 
on the opposite side on the tower
 All right As you hear it slowly open up
this little hand curls around the outside Short
maybe around kneeheight for you Fjord As the
door peeks open you see a male goblin really
well dressed in a tiny little accountants outfit
where its doublebreasted to one side
with a nice lapel Has small spectacles across the
bulbous and pointed nose No hair The
teeth which characteristically of a goblin tend
to overlap and protrude have been really
wellkept Very wellgroomed goblin Pokes around
the corner Hello
 Can I help you
 Do you have an appointment
 He relaxes a second after the chest is
puffed up his presentation relaxes and the
gut  underneath the outfit as he no
longer feels that he needs to put on a
presentation He goes Well let me take a
look at the book Hold on just a second
He closes the door behind him
 You can see the door yeah It wasnt there
when you walked around previously
 It looks like a standard door Its circular
at the top It looks like its wood slats metal
crossbars hold it all together Theres no handle
or knocker It appears to only open from the inside
 Oh yeah A few moments pass The door
opens up again and he has a tiny leather journal
and he All right soonest that weve got here pulls
it back The soonest weve got here lets see
about  months three weeks and four days
 Whats the emergency
 Well come back in a number of months
 Make a persuasion check Actually no make
a deception check because this is
 But youre pushing that this is an
emergency Do you consider it an emergency
 Im going to call you on that
 
 Not to me
 Yes
 Ill tell you what Yussa has bedded down
for the evening You want to come by tomorrow
morning maybe hes in a particularly good mood
and could spare you a minute or two of his time
but as of right now I cannot force a meeting at
dusk with a few unknowns with no particular truth
to their purpose wanting to bypass our entire
system of entry So have a good night and hope for
a better tomorrow
 Door closes
 Yep
 The fishmonger at the fish mart right now
is going like I know its fucking weird right
It scares me I dont like it
 Yeah It does when they come in and out but
then its gone Its really creepy I dont like it
 I want to help you I can say that there is
a very nice special on red snapper
 Well for the entire fish were looking at
least three silver
 Well there you are Its a sizable
snapper
 For the extra silver you get paper
 Wraps it up for you
 At this point the door is closed and you
guys look back and Fjord approaches holding a fish
 At this point as you guys are all talking
and you look back the door is not there anymore
 Thats a true artifact to be fair
 So you guys return to the Lavish Chateau
 Well it depends if you guys are going back
Are you
 So theyve been gone for roughly Id say
two hours
 You have a standard healing potion Caleb
 Do you still have the fish or did you eat
the fish
 The chef offers to prepare that as your
dinner is already being set for the rest of the
group at the request of the Ruby
 By the way Calebs hair is this cowlick
mess where its perpetual dog tongue
licking the entire time that hes been having to
concentrate on his business
  Then jumps towards you but
from ten feet and then appears right in front of
you and knocks you into the wall
 Marion comes and greets you guys Dinner is
prepared Meal is enjoyed and you all prepare
yourselves to bed down for the evening and take on
your events of the following day

excluding Quebec but between that well have a
winner of you guys when we come back here in a few
minutes See you then
 And welcome back So before we get back
into the story our winner of our Wyrmwood
giveaway this week is Sasudo Sasudo
congratulations well have that sent off to you
ASAP After an evenings rest in the luxurious
rooms of the Lavish Chateau and a fine breakfast
what would you like to do for the day
in Nicodranas
 Well I mean do what youre going to do
just try not to get us killed by a wizard please
 The Clovis Concord is a union of all
the various citystates that make up
 Correct
 Yes While each city is locally governed in
and of itself for the marquis that run all the
various merchant guilds Its very much a
guildcentric government
 Kind of
 Yeah in a way But all the marquis work
together to maintain a generally consistent rule
of law and maintain peace and order through that
 You dont know how they feel about him
but from what you heard from the Ruby is that
he seems to be the one person who wont
sell their house in the neighborhood
to get the train tracks built you know
That kind of thing
 There you go
 As you guys have been walking and talking
towards the tower in the early morning hours
 All right as you guys make your way to the
Open Quay you approach the tower All right you knock
 Theres a pause Can I help you
 Youre hearing it around you
 You see about  feet up that balcony that
was there originally is there and standing at the
edge of it you see a figure Hard to see at this
angle and this distance but a figure is there
with long dull golden robes holding a
small teacup and a saucer glancing
over the edge and looking down
 You just happened to approach and
knock for an audience
 Did you make an appointment
with Wensfeld
 Both of you make persuasion checks
 Well it appears that you have not
made an appointment and you do not
have the tea that you are promising
 Then please would you be so kind as to
present me with this dangerous information
 You dont have to shout it You
notice that his voice is a whisper
even though hes  feet away from you
 Youre safe Theres some sort of
amplification to his voice and its placing it
omnipresent around you at this low volume
like hes right there
 Make a perception check
 Glancing up he appears to be elven a
darker complexion which is different from the
elves of Bysaes Tyl up in the Empire which come
from the north near Uthudurn which was mentioned
before so this is probably an elf from Gwardan
which is one of the coastal cities here which
originated from Marquet long ago like
a lot of the Menagerie Coast did
 Some people have hobbies I stay
at home and write this
 He takes a second Im sure that
its crossed my path but it is not in my
immediate peripheral
 Choose one and enter
 You look down to talk amongst yourselves
and theres a door on the wall that wasnt there
when your attention was faced away from it
 And you punch Fjord for no reason
 He was telling him to choose one
and enter so there is a plus one
 Probably
 Yeah
 As you reach out theres no handle for the
door you place your hand on it and it opens
inside As soon as you look within and the rest
of you can see around the rather hulking form of
Caduceus which you have to duck to get through
the doorway on the inside it looks to be a very
simple sitting room a den You can see two
couches facing each other at an angle with a deep
redbrown maroon upholstery to it
a velvety texture
 Youve got to do that now
because youre walking in
 The door is closing behind Caduceus
 You enter behind Caduceus On the inside
there is a singular staircase that spirals down
from the upper floor maybe about  feet up
Theres this set of two couches a small table
theres already a small platter that has a couple
of small teacups and a teakettle of some kind
 You dont know The rest of the chamber has
no windows its all locked off There is a
chandelier above very simple metal ring that has
these glass baubles placed in six different places
along it that give a soft pulsing similar to
firelight a warm orange glow Its a nice dark
comfortable den atmosphere What do you guys do
 There is no tea brewed
 All right As you begin that process you
hear the soft footsteps beginning to descend the
stairs and there you see the figure come down It
is a male elf lightbrown tan skin The hair is
short cut very short in the back and it curls
up into this side wave Jet not jet Jetwhite
is not a thing Stark white hair and very
chiseled features but you can see the crows nest
wrinkles coming in From what elves youve seen
this is a very old elf Of what age begins to come
through there are a lot of years on this elf
Shorter than most elves that youve seen probably
comes to about maybe five feet maybe a little
under that The robes themselves have a golden
shimmer that looks like the threads themselves may
actually be gold or something that very much
mimics the properties of gold As he steps down
the rest of the robe drags down the spiral
He comes and sits on Are you both sitting
at the same couch
 All right He goes and quietly sits in
the one across Sits back There is a stoic
emotionless face there head cocked to the side
out of curiosity Well while you finish your tea
you have promised what is this emergency
you have brought to my attention
and interrupted my morning routine for
 And at whose behest have you been
hired to deliver this information to me
 He eyes you very closely
 So part of this is requesting
alliance with the Cobalt Soul
 Very well Is the tea ready
 How wonderful Pour it if you
do not mind Thank you
 It is quite good
 Id appreciate it Blooming Grove yes Is
there a name to this one
 This I recall since you brought it up
yes Thank you Continue please
 Well offer your information and if
there is something I can offer that seems
relative or involved I will be happy to
pass it along as well
 This was the assault on
the TriSpire correct
 Word gets around in certain circles
 Ive heard this as well
 The ocean seems a strange place to
seek for information when the Xhorhasians
are fighting in the East
 Ukotoa is a mythological entity in the
history of the KiNau the people who were of this
coast before the Marquesians came So Ive
heard of it but it has been long gone
 You think this Ukotoa is connected
to this war in the east
 There are strange things happening all
across Exandria at any given time To find the
threads that truly tie them that takes
an insightful mind Continue
 Well to be honest there are many jungle
landscapes on this coast I have not heard
anything of Ukotoas location nor is it of
any particular interest to me at the moment
 Tell me of this thing you found
 You see his fingers trace a few small gestures
in the air speaking very quietly under his breath
 Interesting
 How did you come about this
 How does this connect to the war
in the east
 You are not wrong The individual
who this belongs to however
has been missing for quite some time
 Well there is no confirmation of that
but has not been seen in many many years
 Interesting
 Is this related to the corruption
from Malaismere
 If I recall this Blooming Grove
exists in the Savalierwood correct
 The fact that its been able to resist
the corruption of the forest this long
is in itself a testament to its guardians
 I do not think that is my specialty
unfortunately I am not a purveyor of faith
 I could not tell you Perhaps it was an
imperfect enchantment or perhaps the magic that
holds sway over the Savalierwood is
growing stronger But that would be
 It would but unfortunately
that is beyond my specialties
 It is on the borders actually of the
Greying Wildlands in the north It is closer to
the Empire than it is Xhorhas so it would a
bigger threat to the King Bertrand Dwendal than
it would be to any of the Kryn Dynasty
 But it seems to only spread through the
forest and seems to be proximity to Malaismeres
ruins so it has been that way for a number of
centuries If there is a sign of it expanding into
the Pearlbow Wilderness then that is something you
should definitely let the king know but I do not
know of any signs of that Once again
I do not mean to rush you but
 I saw something I do not know
the nature of it
 These are radical claims that you make
 How much capability does it have How did
you come upon it These are now two extremely
powerful things in your grasp that you seem to
not have a full understanding of its capabilities
That is dangerous
 And you bring them to me why
 So you are from the Empire You are of the
Cobalt Soul in Zadash but you are not aligned
with the Dwendalian Empire yourself
Where are your allegiances
 And you
 So you have no allegiances You can be
bought any which way depending on the offer
 That does not inspire trust
 I want to know the individuals that
I would work with can be trusted
 What are the terms youre offering
 But she says she has no loyalty unless
the world pulls her in a direction
 But that is indeed a loyalty then
 At this point a voice comes around the
corner from the staircase above that goes Sir
Just got some sort of a and the goblin
starts running He goes Not now Wensfeld
Turns back up the steps
 So what you are saying is you are a band of
unaligned roving mercenaries in search of
alliances outside of the political interests
of this current conflict
 Then what do you hope to gain
from my alliance
 About
 And eventually what favors
would you be asking
 Make a persuasion check
 You see his right eye just and both of
you being relatively insightful people you see
just this faint twitch at the corner of the right
eye at the mention of the Concord He goes
My loyalty is something that is gradually earned
This is as much as youve earned And he looks to
the room There are many floors in this tower
With more loyalty earned perhaps youll see more
of my tower But for now and he looks over to
the door The door opens up The rest of your
friends can enter Lets have a conversation
 All right As you guys enter again
the rest of the group
 No the goblin is gone Literally
hes still sitting on the couch
the door just opened and hes waiting
for you all to enter
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay So you got a marching order on this
All right So you go out to retrieve them
You stayed on the couch
 So you guys are staying
 All right At this point Yussa closes his
eyes for a second whispers something Welcome to
my chambers So now that weve gotten some
conversation underway I would like to know who I
am speaking with You are all what Who
 Very well
 Dont even attempt You are
 Fjord
 Yasha just gives a nod Yasha I am Yussa
Errenis I am the owner of the Open Quay and I
have been a practitioner of the arcane arts in
seclusion for over  years You carry with you
something that is very dangerous and I would very
much like to stay here because the longer its on
your persons the larger chance there is you
misuse it and destroy yourselves or it falls in
the hands of someone who should not have it
 Case in point
 Yes
 Should you wish to come and discuss
or see it or we can compare notes
on our experiences you know where it is
 This was something that did not belong to
you to begin with that came into your possession
from a third party and you are just the current
custodian of it and nearly got yourself killed
I am doing you a favor I will study it I will keep
it here where its safe If you have need of it
if you need to come look at it or wish to
learn of its secrets do so in my presence
where it can be done safely
 You
 It looks like within your coat you are
holding tomes Are you a practitioner of the
arcane arts yourself
 Have you the capabilities to transport your
compatriots via circles of arcane nature
 Yes
 I may perhaps have something like that
but at the very least I do keep such a circle
reserved for the select friends I keep
 Yes So as part of our trust of me
keeping this sphere you would be granted the
capabilities once you are able to make this
journey to return here with your friends You
would have an anchor here on the coast and you
would be under my protection when you arrive
Does that seem like a fair trade those
who seek friends and allies
 Okay He takes it and lifts it
inspects it
 He wraps it into his robe
 The robe you watch as he places it over the
sphere and the shape beneath just dissipates
 Of where this leads I do And
the mage it once belonged to
 No I do not know him personally but there
are few in my circles that have not heard of his
exploits in the past
 At a certain level of arcane practitioning
morality becomes a bit ambiguous but to the
common man I would say probably
not a very team player
 And yes I do have access to various
spells but Ive earned them Im willing to share
knowledge based on the development of our
friendship and proven loyalty
 By not fucking me over
 You did and I made a trade of information
and a safe haven When you find more information
like this and more items like this bring them
back to me There may be times where perhaps I
could use some help in doing things that Im not
comfortable leaving my tower for Maybe you could
be of aid in that case There will be
opportunities Im sure to earn more trust
 Sad one
 But you have to earn
 I would like very much to see this
other thing that you have come across If this
is a powerful artifact I am very curious as to
what other geometric shapes youve come across
 You are not incorrect
 Well might I at least possibly inquire as
to what it is capable of You may not know the
dangers you carry with you as you obviously
did not understand of this sphere
 Very well
 You have a geometric shape
that makes babies
 I am generally uncomfortable in
making deals regarding passing glances at
worldshattering artifacts if that be the case but
you have blessed me with some fine tea this day
 You have my assurance And if it is indeed
such a dangerous item and you wish to carry it
with you then woe be unto you
So Let me see it
 Takes it and begins to cast a spell
that you recognize as an Identify spell
Casts another spell that you dont recognize
 Takes a moment and concentrates on it
and you watch his face go slack a familiar
expression that many of you have seen
your friends as they concentrate on it do so
 Aww itll be so disappointing when
they pass through the illusion
 You dont know You think a mage lets
people into his living room unprotected
are you kidding me You dont live as long
as he has without some sort of backup
 About a minute passes and then the muscles
in his face tighten back into his neutral
expression This is I have studied much and
this is new to me Id be worried if this was
something dangerous that I knew and understood
well I find it far more concerning that this is
something I know nothing of Where was
this found
 Very interesting  Whatever magic
this is it blends elements of arcane and divine
but is outside of what I know can sense
Its very alien
 I mean if there is any sort of dominion
to hold you take what is available I mean
everything as far as Vasselheim to Emon to
AnkHarel Anyone in power has their threads and
eyes out for what could possibly help them
maintain their positions in power and what dangers
there are out there That is beyond morality that
is just simple intelligence to survive in a world
that is continuously beset by darker powers and
things beyond our control If this was taken
from Xhorhas then god knows what they
were attempting to do with it
 Make babies
 Then very bad people will be after you
 That does not necessarily mean youre
protected Just be careful
 I think that is probably the best method
you have Remove it only when absolutely necessary
and for short periods of time That will protect
from divination on this plane but only this plane
 I did not say Im on the side of good
and right I am on the side of maintaining
a balance in which society can exist
 No
 I have no idea what this is
 Hes glancing to you all like
 Thank you
 Im sure
 Then I will do my best to do what I can on
my end of things Well thats been my morning tea
 Well we have one more business to attend
Follow me The rest of you and he waves his hand
across the table and on the side of
the platter where the teacups were
this conjured plate of biscuits appears
 Enjoy
 He walks away gesturing for you to follow
 You head up the stairs Doesnt say a word
to you It curls around and around for a good two
minutes No windows very little light The
occasional similar sparkling globe emitting a low
torchlight until eventually you come to another
door The staircase continues upward in a spiral
but theres a doorway to the right and a small
landing It opens He enters and you enter with
him This chamber it is a small domed room
maybe about  feet across and it is
circular on the base It domes to the top
and there is no other exit
 Mmhmm You enter
 The door closes Darkness All of a sudden
you see a rune above you that emits a bright blue
light that lights the chamber Everything is in
shades of blue He gestures to the floor and as
you glance down you can see now where the
blue light hits this large runic circle that
encompasses the entire chamber is now
glowing in response You recognize it This is
a teleportation circle This is a receiving
teleportation circle He looks to you
 He says There are transports I have in
other parts of this tower to different places
Earning my trust perhaps you may gain more
access But for now you have a place to return to
How much time do you need He gestures
to the symbol To memorize it
 I believe its thlevel
 This isnt the spell this is the
receiving rune When you learn the spell
you can use that spell to return here
 Do you have access to the spell
 You can either choose it at a higher
level when you decide to go up
 Then there you go When you finish he goes
A quick learner Good to know Where did you train
 Impressive You have a talented eye
for picking up arcanic sigils and glyphs
 That they are
 It is designed to keep people like
you out but sometimes tenacity makes
for interesting breakfast conversations
 It was But you came anyway and
look where you are
 That might one day get you killed
Or may one day get you what you seek
 Ive lived quite a long while and the only
reason Ive lived this long is I have made allies
I followed them into sometimes stupid unnecessary
circumstances Many of them died helping me Many
of them I outlived But I wouldnt be where I am
today if I didnt at least trust in the power of others
 Use who you need to but know everyone can
be useful if you can mete out their skills
 Im sure you do as well The
door behind you opens up again
the light turns dark and the stairways
behind you
 Eventually you find your way to the staircase
the faint light below guides you to the exit
 Yeah eventually leads you back down to
the chamber You guys are down there waiting
 Uniquely each biscuit tastes different It
is specially designed for your personal interests
 You guys exit the tower closes behind you
 All right In the rest of the day that comes
about lest you have any other particular plans to
deal with you get to spend the remainder of this
day and the evening with your mother You guys can
pick out your food and supplies for the road If
youre wishing to purchase things well say for
the bulk of your journey I mean making stops
along the way at least to get you from Nicodranas
to Trostenwald Well say if youre heading
are you heading by way of Zadash
to Felderwin or are you crossing over
from Alfield to Felderwin
 You can do that
 All right As you complete your
business and have another
 Yes
 Bryce is in Alfield
 Yes they are
 Thats okay You gather your things the
next morning comes after a day of comparative
relaxation in the city which has been not too
bad The next morning comes the cart has been
fetched you have the rest of your things Your
mother catches you as youre about to head out
and goes Jester would you like any of your
things from your room before you leave
 All right no worries She goes off and
begins packing a few things in a little bag and
she comes out with the rest of you You guys
are getting things in the cart and she steps out
and theres a little bit of hesitance as she steps
beyond the threshold of the Chateau Takes a deep
breath and then takes a few more steps Takes
like the  feet to the cart and goes Here
 I had something made for you while you
were at sea She pulls out of a small pouch
that she has on the side this thin golden chain
with about the size of a raisin a little ruby
set in with really pretty filigree and places it
around your neck This way no matter where
you are no matter whats happening
you always have the Ruby with you
 What did you get me
 Aww Thank you so much Pulls you in and
kisses you on the forehead and rubs your cheek
Im going to miss you
 Aww
 Please do Every day if you can
 Take care of her
 You know not the vengeance I will
bring upon you and the army of men
and women and inbetween that
will do what I tell them to
 Not possible
 She puts the honey back in the pouch
Be safe everyone
 I love you too Jester
  Jumps into the cart
 You feel Sprinkle starting to back up
around your neck
 As the cart takes off making its way to the
northward streets to exit Nicodranas Marion
Lavore watches you all leave and gives a quiet
wave as you all disappear into the streets As she
disappears around the bend and you turn around in
your seat to look ahead you can see the open blue
sky above you and looking towards the distant
Cyrios Mountains in the path before you you make
your way northward So this is quite a few days
travel Ill put aside my Nicodranas notes
 Its about four and a half days to the
Wuyun Gates For the sake of brevity because
weve done this once before The guards that
are posted at the Wuyun Gates theres much
more of a force of security here As you
approach there is a back up to the caravan
more than you previously experienced exiting
Each person coming through is having to
provide paperwork that says where youre
going who youre going to see Its customs
essentially Its getting close to your
passing through what do you do
 Okay so there was Yedaka whos the guy who
runs the actual event and helms the Victory Pit
if thats what youre talking about If not then
youre referring to the Starosta of the city
 That was Starosta Wyatt Fedar
 Do you have any pieces of paperwork
that have his handwriting Or his signature
 You do have paperwork
 Kosh was his name
 So would you like to go ahead
and attempt that
 All right what would you want it to say
 Kosh Clearbarker
 Clearbarker
 All right Go ahead and make a d roll
with your proficiency bonus and your dexterity
 All right so go ahead and make your roll
 Correct
 You feel pretty confident about your
piece of paperwork you presented The DC was
definitively lowered because it was something
that you had existing paperwork as an example
of handwriting on so upon passing through you
present your paperwork and the guard there gives
you a look All right You are returning to
Alfield what is your business in Nicodranas
 Okay and you are returning to the
Empire Youre not staying in the Empire
 All right and whom do you pray to
  Make a deception check

 Yeah
 Hold here for a second And makes
a whistle and some the other guards
begin to circle and theyre going to do
a full inspection on the cart
 They just look through it and go and
he reaches in to go and rummage through
and passes through the illusion
And you explain how it works
 Let them through They go ahead and wave
you though The highrolling paperwork helped you
 All right Now the open blue skies
of the coast give to the winter gray of the
Marrow Valley You have four days to
Trostenwald Is there anything you
wish to do in that four day period or no
 Make an animal handling check
 Nugget hasnt spent some time with you
And occasionally will listen to you but mostly
just seems excited that things are around and he
gets to go out You get the sense that the entire
time you were gone he was cooped up in your old
room and is just like  looking at
everything around and occasionally leaps out of
the cart after something and chases it down
and then just bamfs back
 Its like a tether teleport You
make your way to Trostenwald
 I dont think you got a name for it you
just got a description of what it contained
 The Salty Sea
 Do you have your alchemical supplies
with you
 Okay go ahead and make This will
be proficiency plus intelligence modifier
make it with disadvantage because
youre on a moving cart
 Yep
 Okay Id say if you focus on it
entirely from your trip between Nicodranas
and Trostenwald you could probably
prepare half of that amount
 So as far as the vials of oil what would
be considered a singular vial the whole
amount that you purchased could make four 
you have two completed that can be used
Theyre prepared as Alchemist Oil
 All right you guys make your way
to Trostenwald
 This is perfect As were moving along if
at any point you want to interject just jump in
 Wait is this Sending
 Sending they can respond to you
 Yeah Thats how its done in the past
 I will say roll an intelligence check Beau
 Yep
 Okay yeah You are particularly
descriptive in your ability to recall
details about Dairon because you are not
familiar with this individual
 Yeah you give a very specific
detail about them
 Ill allow it
 All right hold on Let me finish up here
while this conversations happening You hear a
voice but Im familiar with this magic I am
recovering in Bladegarden but am safe
Thats all
 Caleb
 Yeah
 As you get to a higher level and travel
further distances its less and less fun to make
you roll survival every night you camp
The general roadside issues that would
come your way are less of a challenge
 Yeah
 All right Do you have any business
in Trostenwald while youre there
 Perfect
 Two incongruent conversationalists
I love it All right cool
 You get some more supplies for the
next leg of your journey if youd like to
To get you to Alfield well say amongst
the whole crew maybe lets see here
 If you want to create food and water
then you dont have to pay for anything
All right cool You travel
this would be two days
 You want to ask around
 Okay while youre there go ahead
and make an investigation check
 Asking around No sign of Gustav
 The few people that knew of him only
because of the conversation and local talk about
 that terrible circus
that came through town
that carnival that killed all them people
 Gustav fucked off as soon as
he was let out
 Youre going to Alfield and then
bypassing Zadash is what you were saying
and then going straight to Felderwin
 You make your way two days to Felderwin
Im sorry to Alfield Any business in Alfield
 Okay As you approach the city the people
here go about their business per normal though it
does look like there is a presence of Righteous
Brand soldiers maybe a hundred or so that have
been stationed here on top of the crownsguard The
crownsguard were here before and you see
Righteous Brand patrolling the major ins and outs
and doing passes around the vicinity General
protection to this city has been increased in the
presence of this war You approach the city and
ask around Bryce is both available though
looking a bit harried They approach
My goodness its been some time friends
You look traveled
 What can I do to help you
 Well best that we can best that I know
at least were just being as careful as
possible We didnt expect things to press this
far east this quickly From what I know is
Felderwin just recently took an assault from the
brief missives that have been sent around to
various lawmasters in the vicinity
The attacks came from underground
 It wasnt a direct assault Apparently
and this put us in a bit of a tizzy recently
they managed to just appear
in the city from underneath
 They burned some of the fields and
destroyed a few buildings and then left
I dont know the exact number of dead
youd probably have to ask
 Im a bit worried yes Were all a bit
worried We dont want to alarm the populace but
 rumors spread and we do our best
to quell them
 Its more of a we dont have any of the
fancy subterranean sewers as cities like Zadash
to the north Its mostly a digahole
outhousetype scenario
 Good Were just hoping that there isnt
much of a reason to stop in Alfield At least we
know that Felderwin supplies most of the Empire
with its food and crops and such so there seems
to be some strategic reason for that assault
though I dont see what purpose Alfield has in the
larger spectrum so Im banking on that
 Where are you off to
 Well good news is theyve already been
attacked Hopefully the lightning doesnt strike twice
 Hi yes we met briefly when you
passed through here earlier
 Pleasure to see you again as well
 Thats all right If theres anything that
I can do to aid you if you need to pass through
again just let me know You know
where to find me
 Good to see you as well Travel safe
 Theres not much I can really help with
Im not really involved in the red tape of most
things If its another lawmaster youre going
to speak with thats one thing but
 No I dont
 I am indeed and that would be illegal
 Wonderful thank you for the opportunity
to prove my virtue
 To be honest weirder come through
here fairly often especially these days
 Yeah The direction youve grown is
curious but in all sincerity its good to see
you all All right be safe
 Jinx indeed All right back to business
 They head to the rest of their days work
 Okay Ill say from Alfields about a
threeandahalf days travel Gathering your
supplies there making your way eastward
towards Felderwin is there any business
you wish to attend to on the way
 Okay
  There you go
Ill send you an email later Congratulations
 That my friends
is the sound of history
 No Ive been defeated Curse
your worldly understanding of trade
 Take your orange piece Thats not even
an orange piece Anyway in crossing the bridge
to cross the Eistus River cresting the hills before
it you can already see the low haze of gray and
brown thats gently fading over the region As you
reach the peak and look down upon the familiar
sight of the oncegreen farmland that you had
passed by when you were heading north toward
Shadycreek Run you can already see a fair patch
of the Tillage lies black and ashen Probably a
quarter of it As you begin to make your way
towards the outskirts of the city you can already
see small squadrons of Righteous Brand patrolling
the fields I mean a dozen small squadrons of
about  soldiers each
 You can see quite a few military has been
relegated and probably sent southward from
Bladegarden since this incursion a few weeks back
As you come upon the outside of Felderwin which
is built not too far from the Eistus River you
can already see there are a number of buildings
burned and blackened on the opposite end of the
fields The fields are on the northern side of the
city On the southeastern side theres a section
of the town that appears to have burned or burnt
down to varying degrees depending on buildings
 Okay Anyone else
 Okay lead them to the city You see that
there are crownsguard a little more than usual
Definitely on the perimeter of the city you can
see bands of ten to  Righteous Brand set along
at fairly intense positions to look outward
Theyre doing their best to lock things down as
this investigation is still being completed
as to what transpired here
 You make your way to that part of the city
Glancing over towards the first main plaza
intersection of this part of Felderwin theres
a few people talking A blue flash catches
your attention out of the corner of your eye
You see three Righteous Brand soldiers that are
standing with an elven woman in fine
flowing clothes of green and black
She angrily gives a few offhanded orders
at a distance while it looks like the
source of this blue flash a male figure
is standing where previously was not
 This figure that apparates is wearing deep
blue robes and appears to be elven with very long
white hair Also an elder elf though of pale skin
in comparison to the one you met previously
Approaches with haste towards this woman They
begin to whisper for a moment before he shoos off
the rest of the guards and the two of them begin to
walk together the pair of them having a conversation
 Make a perception check
 You see them You dont recognize them
 Meaning it was a male elder
elven figure but
 Just like Yussa but Yussa was of Gwardan
descent This appears to be of northern elf which
most of that bloodline stems from Malaismere
and what split off into Bysaes Tyl
 Theyre talking amongst each other and
then walk and disappear around a corner
 Youre too far away
 Yes Do you continue on
 You recognize both of them
 The woman is Lady Vess DeRogna the Archmage
of Antiquity at the Cerberus Assembly
 Lady Vess DeRogna the Archmage of
Antiquity of the Cerberus Assembly
 Antiquity
 The man the elder elf is Martinet Lunidus
Daleth
 Martinet Lunidus LUNIDUS Daleth
DAapostropheLETH
 This wont come back to bite you
 Archmage of Domestic Protections
 Domestic Protection
 DeRogna
 You guys continue on
 You head down that eastern thoroughfare
passing by a number of homes and businesses You
start coming upon the ones that were damaged You
see one looks to be a warehouse that burned down
There is an inn called the Glassy Grass Inn
that youre familiar with Nott
 That has burned to the ground There
is another building next to that There is
the Brenatto Apothecary that is also burned
to the ground There are people rummaging
through the rubble through some of their
homes still looking and pulling out
elements of whatever they can gather
of their former life
 You can see there is a crownsguard a
pair of crownsguard that are walking this way
 For anything in particular or just trying
to make it look like youre looking around
 Make a perception check
 You glance around looking through the
visible rubble moving a few things Dont appear
to be any signs of life nor any signs
of death immediately
 Make an investigation check
now that youre poring through
 Unfortunately in this scattering of
rubble I mean you can still see the frame of
the building standing with an element of the roof
thats still there but most of it has fallen
inward This was a place of business that appeared
to have a few rooms of homestead attached to the
back of it but all that has burned and fallen in
The crownsguard walk by and stop One of them
a female looks over and goes Hey
you looking for help
 Its terrible isnt it
 We dont get this kind of thing this far
west Were not supposed to I dont want to
fight those things
 The cricks The things that came in
and did this
 Yeza
 I dont know They havent found a body
so thats something His boy Luke was found safe
and is staying with whats her name
Looks over to the other guy The other person
the woman looks at him and goes
At Old Ediths house
 You know of Old Edith yeah An older
woman a few buildings down
 Yeah Lukes okay
 From what I heard they just burned and
slashed Just under a hundred crownsguard were
killed a few of my friends  civilians died
in the fires It was the weirdest thing
I watched friends of mine begin
to slow down Anyway
 Yeah Thankfully not on the front line
 They went back where they came through
the tunnels and collapsed them behind them
 There Between the city and the tillage He
points in the direction where those two were walking
 Did you know them
 Im sorry for yours too The two
continue walking
 This would be more of an investigation
since youre looking through rubble
as opposed to peering through
 The ones that you were just speaking to
 Theyre walking off now
 Lets make an investigation check
as a group One of you helms it
 With their help you have advantage
on the roll
 You find a bunch of shattered alchemists
different kinds that all have charred elements to
them You find in a back room elements of bedding
that are mostly burned away some childs toys
wooden that have been charred and burned
to a crisp No signs of any bodies You do
find the basement which you do know of
The basement door is locked
 Go ahead and make an attempt
 Its not moving at all
 Make a strength check
 Its not budging
 Yashas going to get extremely angry and
rage and attempt to make her way through
At advantage strength check
  Its not budging That lock is holding
tight far more than it should for its design
 Okay Yeah thatll do it The Arcane Lock
on it dissipates and the pressure that has been
placed on it well say the lock falls open
Do you open the basement
 Stepping down the stairs underneath its a
small chamber no more than  by  feet The
room is tossed not like you remember Theres
a pile of broken table shards in the far right
corner Theres additional shattered glass all
over the floor here Theres an iron chest
roughly three feet long by a foot wide that sits
in the far left corner A single chair holds the
center of the room Thats what remains inside
 Make an investigation check
 It looks like there was definitely a
struggle in here Looking at the walls it looks
like there are blade scrapes against bits of
stone A lot of the furniture in here has been
destroyed as part of that from heavy impacts
But the center chair seems perfect
 There is not an invisible person
 It looks like the room
 Based on your investigation check
you gather that the chair was probably
placed here after this whatever transpired
in this room
 There is no other exit from this chamber
 Make an investigation check
 Make your separate rolls here
Oh are you helping
 So you get advantage on this
 Theres an iron chest
 As you guys are inspecting all this you
and Caduceus are giving a fair play on the walls
No doors no other exits Its just that
stairway from what you can find
 It is locked
 That breaks the Arcane Lock on it
In spite of the resistance the spell
you  and see a brief  as the
Arcane Lock is dispelled and unlocked
 You open it up Make a constitution
saving throw for me please
 A brief puff of what looks like a dull black
gas  in your face and you pull
out of the way and inhale a little bit Its a
weird dizzying sensation that comes over
your body for a second but
you manage to shrug it off
 You see inside a retractable silver tripod
of some kind The apex looks like its set to hold
something Its three of them that come together
and you imagine where itd open up theres
a little platform beneath it They all dont
meet really at the top Theres three things
that are set to hold a device of some kind
 It doesnt look like it has similar
characteristics or metal per se
but you can try and fit it in if you want to
 Yes there are three empty vials One full
one that seems to contain it seems like its on
the verge of liquid and gas There is liquid in
there but a lot of it seems to be this heavy
foglike condensation a dull gray color
 There appears to be a conglomeration
of notes that were destroyed burned
Most of it looks like shreds that are piled
up in case someone were to attempt to try
and do something with it later There are two
pieces of paper that appear to be still legible

 You do not
 You do not recognize any handwriting
 From the investigations that youve
already put through that seems to be
most of anything of interest Everything
else has either been removed or is just
broken furniture and whatever
this laboratory once was
 The chest is a little big for a haversack
 Its a threefoot by onefoot
 Actually threefoot by you might
be able to fit it in longways into the
Bag of Holding The Haversacks pouches
arent large enough
 You do have a Bag of Holding from
 You found it under the bed of
 My brains not working
The Iron Shepherds with Lorenzo
 Make an investigation check
 Its a chair that was probably
placed here after this attack
 I mean Ill say based on the chairs
placement the chest and the fact that it was
locked when you left people had to have come back
in and back out since this attack happened
Probably whoever locked this chest put this chair
here and then locked the room as they left
 Ill allow it Its simple enough for
you to do with your hand if you want to
Its not Arcane Locked but its locked
 Appears to be a chair
 Yes Its a chair Its a standard chair
 Correct No you gather that whoever came
down here last brought the chair with them to
probably lock their things and leave it here
and then lock the basement behind them
not expecting anyone to make their way in
in the interim
 Caduceus has been cleaning it
 You exit the basement
 Okay The lock is pretty rough now
You think it locked It got bashed open
by Yasha and between that and the Dispel
its probably not going to hold
 Okay You look around the vicinity It looks
like there are some people who are looking over
seeing you in the ruins Theyre other civilians
a couple farmers and townsfolk Theyre not
staring theyre just walking and noticing you all
standing in the rubble They keep walking
 Like a five minute walk
 Okay You roll the cart along Its
not even a five minute walk actually
Its a few houses down Its very quick
 You come to the humble hovel of thatched
roof and stone walls where Old Edith lives
The door is currently closed
 Okay A moment passes and the door opens
up and an elderly human woman comes to the door
Gray hair that goes past her shoulders Its a
little wild and unkempt and wiry at the edges
There are wrinkles that scrunch the face in this
perpetual smile and the eyes are almost beady
behind the folded forehead and lids that have
fallen with time Hello Can I help you
 Ah I thought you were dead
 My goodness Luke Luke You see a small
halfling boy maybe no more than five years old
peek around the doorway Shaggy
light brown hair blue eyes Yeah
 Daddy said the goblins killed you
 Edith says Daddy went away to help the war
but I think shes lying Hes probably dead too
like I thought you were
 No Daddy locks me away when
the mean lady comes by
 He stiffens up Hes overwhelmed
and untrusting of this scenario
 But you still pick him up The mean lady
with the pointy ears
 Mmhmm
 Daddy would put me in my room
 That was the night when all
the loud noises happened
 Daddy pushed me out of the house and said
go so I ran to Edith Everything was on fire
 No It was just a lot of scary
people in armor
 Mommy where were you
 I get presents but he just says
theyre from somebody
 Is Daddy alive
 And youre alive again
 Then dont die He turns around
and walks back into the house
 Im just happy to see youre okay Ill
watch the boy Is there anything I can do to
Im real sorry
 My husband passed away seven years ago
and its just been me
 Look Veth wherever you go let me know
how I can help If you need us to leave
well leave I mean youve given me enough
to at least get out of town for a while
 I can do that
 Okay I can do that
 Hes a good boy Veth You did good
 Take care of yourself
 She closes the door At that point
back where you rode from walking across
the street are the two figures that you saw
when you first came towards the plaza
Walking and quietly talking to each other
heading towards the rubble of the apothecary
 Thats where were going to
end tonights episode

 Pick up next week
 It was
 For a while
 Hey I mean look at it this way If you
guys had come here instead of Nicodranas
you would have been here when
all this went down
 Anyway I know RIP ears at the
end of the episode
 Yep All right guys Well pick up here
next Thursday Its going to be a hell of a week
for all of us Well see some of you guys at the
art gallery this weekend Well see some of you
guys at the live show on Saturday Super excited
to have everyone step back into their
Vox Machina shoes Well pick up at this
crazy point next Thursday
 Well see you then We love you very much
Have a wonderful week and is it Thursday yet
Good night


 Welcome back everybody Last we left off
The Mighty Nein had been returning from
Nicodranas They had made their way northward from
the Menagerie Coast left their ship in the care
of their favorite tortle to earn money
at sea while youre away
 You made your way northward past the Wuyun
Gorge back into the Dwendalian Empire Passed
through Trostenwald and Alfield and met up with
Bryce for a bit to catch up and then made your
way toward Felderwin Upon arriving you
discovered the city was still visibly scarred from
the recent assault that it had seemed to suffer at
the hands of the Kryn Dynasty from Xhorhas
Upon perusing the streets you came to discover that
the location that Nott was leading you towards was
vicinity you did not find a body but you did
find a basement where you found ruined furniture
a few traps a chest and a mysterious chair that
has grabbed the nations imagination
 Yall going to die You thought the gazebo
was bad Anyway So
 However you also found that apparently the
person who previously had lived there was nowhere
to be found and the son of that individual was
being held at a nearby home of another person who
lives here in Felderwin You went there with Nott
Nott took the form of a halfling and proceeded to
speak to this child as her son After a bit of
interesting conversation and curiosity you said
goodbye and you turned to find these two powerful
magic users that Caleb had identified as members
of the Cerberus Assembly were walking their way
towards the ashen ruins of the apothecary deep in
conversation That is where we left off So
Mighty Nein what would you like to do
 Yes I can do that We have Lady Vess
DeRogna Yes Shes an elven woman in fine flowing
clothes of green and black deep green with black
designs across and around the edges of the
billowing sleeves Jewelry around the fingers a
number of rings and a series of necklaces
They each contain some sort of a circular gem 
that dangles from them like a little collection of
colors She has short medium brown hair and
appears to be of not a young elven age
necessarily but not as old as her current
compatriot which is Martinet Lunidus Daleth
who is the Archmage of Domestic Protections 
He had long white hair
 Also elven They are both elven
 Yep keeping tabs on that Thats really the
extent of what you can see at this distance
You are currently a few houses down standing 
outside of Old Ediths house and in the moment
of the tension of the conversation you had just
had and the intensity of Notts disposition
glancing and seeing them walking up and stopping 
right at the cusp and talking to each other
 Yes
 From where youre standing here not
terribly far maybe a ten minute walk
 You could loop around a bit probably
go southward Youre not that far from the
Samir River You can scoot a southwestern
direction in an arc probably make it
 minutes to avoid them entirely
 All right Moving past the handful of people
in the city that are noticing this strange band of
adventurers that have wandered through you make
your way past the outskirts and you can see the
river itself cruising right along It would be a
beautiful landscape if there wasnt this intensity
of emotion and the distant haze of longgrayed
smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the
partially burned farmlands Nevertheless Nott
leads you over towards one of the shaded banks
under a few trees and you come to a stop
 Make a perception check
 Glancing about you do not see anybody
keeping watch What you do notice however is
that a lot of the patrolling Righteous Brand the
small bands that have been keeping tabs are all
gathering towards the southern edge where the farm
fields of the Felderwin Tillage hit the town of
Felderwin Where as they were scattered
theyre all amassing in one space
 Correct Thats as much as youve heard
 Make a perception check
 Your emotions are transfixed
and even though you look around
your attentions still focused on Nott 
Nothing catches your eye
 So youre casting Lesser Restoration
 Okay
 Technically alcohol is a toxin
 Yeah so Ill allow it
 You feel this warm glow emanating from
Caduceus hands and then in that moment the fuzzy
numbness that you are accustomed to sitting in
especially in places of great fear or emotion fades
And everythings back to being crystal clear
 Theres not much in the way of a waterfall
unfortunately Youre in the center of the valley
so what hills there are are just hills The river
here continues cutting through the valley but
youre probably a good off the top of my head
 or so miles from any elevation to cause
a major waterfall
 Youre next to the river and what
little noise its making Its nice
 There was that one inn that burned down but
there is one inn you know called the Goldfield
Tavern and Lodge Thats one of the more traveled
inns A lot of people that come in and out of
Felderwin thats one of the more popular
destinations
 Theres northeast and southwest Northeast
would be more in the direction of the fields and
clearer view Southwest would be further away from
civilization
 Theres little clusters of trees
here and there
 Cast it twice
 You have two more
 As the sporadic phrases make their way
through the arcane weaves of the various magical
ley lines that invisibly traverse the exterior of
Exandria they make their way towards Bryces ear
somewhere in Alfield and they respond a
moment later All right Ill do my best
Please dont send too many more

 That was it
 Through the city
 Okay Itll take you a while
 Okay Make a perception check for me
Caduceus as you guys are passing around the
southern edge heading towards the
western side of Felderwin
 Okay Keeping an eye out the main thing you
notice it seems like a majority of the Righteous
Brand have gathered and are heading northeast
They are leaving Felderwin
 Correct
 You dont know youre too far away You
havent really asked any specific questions to the
local crownsguard
 Best you can see here the flames have been
long out What brief cinders and wisps of smoke
that had been slowly burning themselves out over
the past couple of weeks or so are on the very
tail end It looks like Felderwin has fallen to at
least a semblance of temporary neutrality The
people are going about their lives the Tillage
the damage that has been done has been done
and now its just trying to pick up and move on
 Youre in the wagon Youre now on the
western side of the village where you can see the
northward Tillage all around
 Caleb roll an intelligence check for me
 On the notes where it mentions beacons
 It seemed to be the case yes
 No Not the people that are currently with
you now no The people that are in the city
 There isnt a uniform robe There is no
and you would know this too Even mages in a
union arent like Lets all wear similar
uniforms They all very much see themselves as
individuals in a circle
 Hmm
 Oh right yeah No For students and
everything there would be uniforms but as far as
members of the Assembly proper theres no
consistent uniform amongst members of the
Assembly As is the nature when you get to a
certain level of arcane capabilities even working
with other mages theres a general for the most
part an idea of Well Im still better than them
 Okay You guys make your way towards
Felderwin proper Through this conversation the
majority of the Righteous Brand has moved on
heading northeast towards the front lines
Crownsguard are still present and there still is
definitely amongst those that are here and Nott
you can say that there are more crownsguard
present here than there usually are Probably just
to keep an eye now that the military has moved on
You make your way towards the center of the city
leading them towards the Goldfield Tavern and
Lodge Heading inside its fairly empty You
place the cart outside for the time being Towards
the bar on the far end you see the familiar face
of Simone Deepwell Hes the halfling the
barkeep and owner Dark brown skin short
graywhite hair Very cheerful demeanor he seems
to be excited at the prospect that folks are
stopping in with all the chaos thats happened as
he leans over the front of the counter and goes
 Okay Just a gnome The rest of you keeping
it as is
 Most of the illusions you had in the city
have faded at this time since youve been
traversing the exterior
 You got it Anyway Simone leans forward and
goes Why hello there What can I do for you
You looking for rooms for the night
 How many is that Book a room each
 How many
 Three Three rooms all right Well we got
plenty of space with events being as they have
been Thatll put you back about lets say one
gold one silver for the three
 All right no worries
 Fumbles through some keys and passes them
out to you Feel free to distribute as need be
If you need anything let me know
 Yeah you could say that You could say
that I mean ruckus is a word
 I certainly hope not Weve kind of seen
kind of the craziest thing Felderwins ever seen
in most of its history since war with the
Dominion So I sincerely hope not I mean its
one less competitive inn but poor Jer I just
feel bad for everyone that lost their homes and
businesses in that affair Its not good
 Yeah theyve been here a few weeks just
walking around Just in case they came back
 No They came in without warning Just tore
through burned things and left
 Yeah see the only real alchemist around
here was one of the homesteads that
burned down unfortunately
 But theres the Crossroads not too far from
here big trading post in the middle of the
Marrow Valley Which youve been to before
Thats probably your best bet
 Oh that was the Brenatto Apothecary
 Last I heard Brenatto went missing Could
probably ask the crownsguard I dont think
theyve updated anything But
 Most of the folks here got killed in the
fire so might best ask them
 I can imagine
 No worries We have two meals here
 one
shortly after dusk and bright and early in the
morning right after sunup You got about an hour
window If you miss it well theres plenty of
Should be plenty of food amongst the city to find
so good luck
 Nah youve still got a few hours before
sundown so just come on by and go ahead
and get me and my wife cooking
 You mean herbs and spices Yeah I mean
theres Felderwin General has all manner of
various flavorings if thats what youre looking for
 Yeah Felderwins not known for its
excitement necessarily But keep your eye out
Who knows what youll find with the right
questions I dont know Ive seen some wild folk
come in these doors in my days Ill tell you
that much Not all as colorful as you though
So cant say my experiences are a good basis
of comparison if you catch my drift
 You and me both Now all them soldiers are
out of here at least Im going to miss the
coinage but I aint going to miss the riffraff
 Yeah no worries Ill see you around
dinner time then
 If youd like to make an investigation
check to wander about the town to see if
you can manage to muster some supplies
 Actually you would yeah Take some
advantage on that
 Felderwin would be one of the few places in
the empire where the Wildmother would be very
popular if she werent outlawed and you get the
sense that there might even be an unspoken worship
to her amongst this very rural farming community
 You manage to go to both Felderwin General
and with Notts help sneak into one of the
elaborate specialty herbgrowing boxes
specifically for the purpose of various medicinal
herbs Well say over the period of the next 
minutes or so you gather what would be
about  gold worth of
 Okay Anyone else got anything
 No but youre getting closer
 You do know there is a female human
physician in the town Theres a number of
physicians and people but there is one named Demi
Leric who is the altruistic member of the
community Doesnt charge but accepts donations
and is often the first to try and help out those
of the more meager lifestyle in this
farming community
  More or less Sure
 Easy enough to find as youre glancing
around because theyre fairly present and
conversing You see one set of three that are
walking past The one seems most energetic in
conversation is in the process of regaling the
other two with some inane tale
Scrawny humanlooking fellow looking like
hes mids or so chin scruff but cant
quite grow a full beard Like me apparently
 Im still getting used to it
 Hey Yeah can I help you
 Cant say Im too familiar with hair
tonics per se
 If youre looking for anything too fancy
Id probably recommend heading on to Zadash
 Not anymore unfortunately
 That was one of the buildings we lost to
the cricks a few weeks back
 Hell if I know Cricks ran in here and
started killing people left and right and
left in the same hour they arrived It was like
a swift nightmare tearing through here
 Let me tell you did you ever have one of
them terrible dreams where something comes out of
the darkness and tries to grab at you and cut at
you Its burning eyes of evil and dark armor of
shadow and nothing
 Well imagine a bunch of them popping out
of the ground and cutting down your friends
 Hell if I know A bunch of grounddwelling
weird dark elf folk
 Well I fought a number of them myself
trying to protect my buddies here but
not everyone was so lucky
 Oh no Just
 Im just doing my job maam
 The one that was here
 Thats right over you go head down two
blocks and to the right follow that on for about
seven eight or so buildings on the left Its
hard to miss Its the second one on the left
thats burned down
 Heres to hoping
 Indeed
 Is there anything else youre looking to
find out
 Youd probably have to find somebody who was
a little more in the thick of it
 Anyone else want anything
 Okay It takes you a little while Not too
long with Notts help guiding you in that
direction but finding the right building
because the sign itself that has Demi Lerics name
on it is itself smokecovered from its across
the street from one of the buildings that was
damaged by the fire As you walk over towards the
edge the door is partially ajar
 Wait just a minute Now sit down Its
going to hurt a bit longer Come in
You open the door come inside Its a very simple
establishment Immediately the smell hits you of
various smells like medicinal herbs and very
strong chemicals You see four five cots that are
set up two of which have recovering townsguard
that are bandaged up and currently laying down
One of them appears to be asleep The other one is
sitting there with a fresh set of bandages put
over burns You see Demi turn around Human woman
maybe late s early s or so heavyset bright
smile bright eyes but sleeves rolled to the
elbows and all business She turns around and the
fingers are hit with whatever material was used to
apply the burn bandages to the one soldier She
wipes her hands this viscous oillike substance
and wipes them on a cloth Well can I help you
 All right
 Certainly Feel free to go and ask
 Incongruency all right
 Well I mean theyre pretty sluggish right
now but thats for obvious reasons
 Weve had a few strange complaints maybe
about a month two months ago Just a wave of
general a nauseous I assumed it was maybe some
bad food that got through a bit Wasnt too serious
 It was a bunch of people complaining about
the same thing in a very short period of time
I assumed maybe it was related
 Yeah they were all in a cluster right in
this region which is why they all came to me
 Yeah no worries
 I mean the town was attacked and people
were killed and burned Thats strange
 Yeah he was right down the street
 No To be honest I was busy trying to
treat who I could That was not a good day
 One night really Around midnight
Suddenly buildings were up in flames people were
screaming I looked out there and there were
cricks running through the street
 Be my guest
 Great Well if you think of any other
questions feel free to ask
 What was the part where she then goes And
one more thing
 For our younger audience
 Columbo was a
television series
 Okay there is one that appears to
be asleep who looks to be a little more
combat wounded The one thats 
semiconscious is mostly burns
 He seems to be Hes sitting there going

  What is wrong with you
Who are you
 Great
 Jeff

 Hes got two apostrophes between the Fs
 Look man Not everyone in a fantasy setting
has awesome names
 Yeah when Im not laid up like this
 Yeah no Thats why I was really
appreciating your entrance there
Very thoughtful
 I accept your recompense
 At this point Demis like Wait wait
wait No no no
 Hes already had enough
 Yeah Thats where I got all this
 Was trying to get people out of the flames
Managed to get his son out it seems
 Yeah Cricks got him and ran
 Yeah
 Back to the fucking hole They headed
northward
 Yeah Was four of them
 Yeah I saw the fire they pushed me into
when I tried to stop them
 Well me and two others but they didnt
you know fare as poorly as I did
 Yeah Yeah it is I mean it was crazy
They came in quick
Fires were set before we knew what was happening
 I guess The last place they lit was the
apothecary
 Thanks
 His eyes go wide
 So youre from the Cobalt Soul
 Perfect
 Anybody else doing anything before
you guys reconvene
Is there anything else you want to look
for or are you ready to gather
 No Im just curious If youve completed
your investigation
 Theres no escape Taliesin
Theres no escaping
 You can go look if you want to
 Jeffs a great name thats why I used it
 Okay So you heading to the tunnel first
 By this point you guys gathering yeah dusk
has happened You can eat first or miss your meal
 The meal is actually quite fresh
Being a farm town its nothing fancy but
everythings hearty and quite delectable Heading
your way outside of Felderwin to the northeast
side where it begins to border on the Tillage
itself theres a group of about eight crownsguard
that are circled around three what would have
been the exit burrows From this distance you can
see its like a sinkhole Its caved in a bit
From this distance you cant see any further than
a few inches to indicate that that seems to be
where it was and the guards are keeping a
perimeter just in case anything were to return
 As you approach hes like Hi
can I help you
 Yeah thats what I hear too
 As far as I know Im just stationed here
but theyve been looking this thing up and down
for two almost three weeks now
 The guard the Righteous Brand Some of
them fancy folk from Rexxentrum
 Yeah I mean theyre all fucking fancy
from up there but some of them elvish people
 I dont fucking know They dont talk to me
 No
 I certainly hope not From what I can tell
wasnt just the cricks Then one of the
other guys one of the soldiers goes like 
I was here I saw it
 Yeah no I mean they didnt dig them
Something dug it for them
 It was a big old mouth made of teeth just
carved out of the ground and then withdrew
and then they poured out
 Yeah yeah I hate this job
 Fucking ran What do you think
Im going to do
 The other guys look at him like 
 and hes like What
You wouldve done the same
 Something like that yeah
 No it broke through but just came out a
few feet and then it pulled back in
We were like What the fuck is that 
Then the cricks came running out
 I mean its possible
 I dont know it was big From what I saw
it was maybe I dont know ten feet wide
 I was over there He points off maybe
a hundred or so feet away
 Yeah
 At this point the other first guard you
were talking to goes Hey whats your
business here anyway
 Make a deception check
 He nods for a second and goes All right
so I guess have a look around Its already been
given the onceover many times 
so take a moment if you need it
 He points over the third one and he goes
Theyve been digging that one for about
two weeks but eventually gave up
 They collapsed them behind them and theres
only so much you can go If they dug all the way
from Xhorhas do you have any idea how long those
tunnels would go for
 Dont really have that kind of manpower
here in Felderwin The soldiers all left so
Im not going to keep digging
 Eh go for it How many you got
 And youre all investigating
 All right just no funny business
Ill be keeping an eye on you
 I would say if you were attempting to Blink
into a solid space it would shunt you out of the
space and you would take a little bit of force
damage General rules for shifting out of
ethereal space into matter
 You approach and see there are three
tunnels and theyre scattered maybe  feet
apart from each other approximately Between 
and  feet The first one youre at here sinks
in about ten  feet and it looks like crumbled
stone and earth with patches of fresh dirt and
the roots that were upended as it tore through
folding over onto the pile It looks like its
been left as it was You go over and inspect the
other one and the same guard and few others walk
with you to keep a close eye The one in the
middle this is the one thats been dug out
Its just pitch black below
 Okay you cast Light The soldiers take a
step back as soon as they see you make a gesture
and brightness seems to appear
 Yeah The tunnel goes straight down Well
close to straight down It comes at a fairly steep
incline There is a rope affixed to a heavy wooden
pike thats been banged into the ground
Do you head down inside
 Your walk technically can only go
something thats five feet inward
You cant just glide through stone
 There you go You head down inside and off
to the side of it theres a small pile of dirt and
rock It looks like a lot of it has been moved off
of the premises for the time being As you head
down and continue to walk it evens out It
probably descends to a depth of about  or 
feet below and continues at a steady decline on
for about another as you continue to walk
continuing to walk you get to a full close to 
feet in before it comes to an ending point
Theres a few carts at the base carrying dirt and
rock up You can see shovels and pickaxes and all
sorts of materials that have been left behind by
the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel
 Looks to be yeah
 Make a survival check
 Okay There are all sorts of footprints in
here There have been soldiers and crownsguard and
all sorts of people in and out of this tunnel You
can see cart tracks and everything but you can
definitely tell that the edges of the top of the
tunnel have a smoother natural carving to them
whatever creature it is definitely burrowed With
that roll Id say you do make out a few footsteps
that resemble more armored boots that are more
unique against the profile of the general
crownsguard andor Righteous Brand soldiers
 In both directions
 Okay Nothing in the vicinity catches your
attention unfortunately
 Okay Nothing catches your attention there either
 Just so youre aware Thunder Step as 
most teleportation effects you have to teleport
to a location you can see
 I mean if you want to get real crazy
roll the dice
 I see what youre doing
 Thats interesting Its a cantrip so
theres definite limitations on its ability
 Ill say two things
 One roll just a
straight wisdom check for me
  okay You close your eyes and focus
feeling your feet connecting with the earth below
you letting the Wildmothers power suffuse your
torso your abdomen your legs and your feet into
the earth below as you begin to release that low
vibration The hum carries through your body and
into rock below and the vibration carries into the
ground and due to the nature of this cavern youre
in it echoes pretty loudly in this space You all
can gently feel it and the guards in the back
start looking around a bit nervous not quite sure
whats happening One of them runs off afraid
Hes like Its going to collapse
 Youve run it for awhile youve cast the
vibration into the rock What are you going to do
to try and listen for
 Make a perception check
 You immediately rush up to edge of where
the stone is the most solid piece of it thats on
that side and listen You feel like you can very
vaguely hear what might be gap a ways in at some
point Youre not sure how far away it might be
and youre not sure how big the gap may be
It could be just a small pocket it could be a
continuation of the tunnel but there does appear
to be some minor element of vibration that carried
through with some differentiation
 At the full end of this tunnel Id say
youre about  or so feet deep

respective chambers What would you like to do
 Jeff
 Weirdest use of Prestidigitation
Ive ever seen
 Mysterious Merrie Melodies like 
 You guys get an evenings rest in
your respective rooms
The morning greets you with the smell of food
being prepared as you head downstairs
As all of you and two other patrons
that are couple of other farmhands
 They look like farmhands
 Their names are Chair
Together they are Chair
 Youre a chair
 Good I love it You have your meal
The day is yours What do you wish to do
 Okay That would be probably either on the
Tillage itself or some of the small grove clusters
along the river that you guys were talking
earlier I assume youre casting Divination
 A reminder it is a specific question
concerning a goal event or activity to occur
within seven days
 Whatever youre trying to ascertain it
needs to be involving a specific goal an event
or activity within the next seven days
 I let it go a little bit last time only
because it was a question of what were they
doing right now Its like well thats an 
activity that they were doing I guess
Choose your words carefully is all Im saying
 An event or an activity I mean
thats a broad spectrum so be specific
 You close your eyes and concentrate
Its a beautiful morning actually
Its a chilly morning but this far enough south
in the empire hasnt hit snow yet The full
winter hasnt come into effect so its still
green fields and mostly blue sky with bits of
clouds As you concentrate the chilled wind
picks up a little bit Across the wind it begins
to form words through your ears
  Ghor Dranas
 Anyone here whos proficient in history
make a history check if you dont mind
 Yashas with you guys
 What did you roll
 Im seeing how much detail you get
 good Yasha first pipes in and goes
Well Ive heard the name Its far further north
than where I lived and we avoided it because
a lot of the beast folk live that way
 Meaning the others who wander the wastes
There are men who are like bull warriors as well
and bugbears and other goblinoids Some are wild
and angry and hungry and we had to protect or
raid them first Others they work with the Kryn
Thats farther north but Ive not been there
 I have not
 No you would not But with the history
checks you guys did pull on Ghor Dranas
Ghor Dranas is important to the history of the
Age of Arcanum When the gods walked the earth
both Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods there
were various areas that were considered their
realm of influence on the mortal plane outside
of their home realms in the different inner and
outer planes A number of these citadels of the 
Betrayer Gods were concentrated around Xhorhas
and the surrounding landscape Thats where the
most intense battles took place of the Calamity
was on Wildemount Ghor Dranas was the name of
the center of their tenuous union Essentially in
the final years of the Calamity it was where all 
of the Betrayer Gods would go to plot the undoing
of the rest of the free people and their creators
in Exandria What remains of Ghor Dranas is where
the Kryn have established their empire their dynasty
Its essentially the capital city of the Kryn dynasty
 Yasha pipes up and says From all that
I know people in my clan saying that
that area up north is perpetual night
 From what I hear yes
 As a note just to remind you if youre
thinking of distances and times The attack
transpired weeks ago so youre not right on their
tail Consider that in what youre planning
 Mind you your options are your options
 There are many possibilities here Many
 You dont quite know where Ghor Dranas is
You know its east Right now the war is right here
These are the garrisons Put that in the center
there By the Brokenveil Bluffs these are
where the two the Ashguard and Rockguard
Garrisons are One of the garrisons has been lost
to the Kryn and they are currently holding it at
the border Bladegarden right there is the
foremost front of the military now The conflict
right now is being held from what youve heard
so far Your information is dicey at best because
youve been gone for a while The last you know
this is where the focus of the conflict is
There you go
 You get a very clear image of the last
memory that Nott has of Yeza
 Okay What message do you send
 Theres no response and then a very faint
one Hello I dont know Its very dark
I have to be quiet but thank you Thats it
 Do you change your form or do you
show up as Yeza
 You find your way to the exterior
of Ediths house
 A few moments pass a door opens
Hi can I help you
 Yes
 Hello
 Right yes Can I help you
 Why are we heading to Alfield
 Oh okay How long are we supposed to be
staying
 Okay
 Oh thats nice
 Does Alfield do they have Ive never
been to Alfield so Im just wondering
never mind She turns around
 Bryce got it She turns back to you
and goes Thank you
 You too
 All righty You guys go and search for
 You find Jeff there as soon as you walk into
the door Demis off to the side reading a
leatherbound journal that shes either reading or
making notes in She looks up and she goes Aye
 No she pulls it back
 You look over to Jeff whos like Oh no
 Yeah what about them
 I mean they cant abandon
 Thats no What are you asking
 What for
 To Alfield Thats easy
 My friends can probably do that Its just
to Alfield and back they can say its under business
 No you still have to pay them This is
under the table technically
 Hold on  He sits up
and stands up slowly
 The two of you limp down to one of the
tiny little seedy bars that doesnt even have
a name on the front
 Im going to put it out there
 
you dont have a trustworthy face
Theyre not going to talk to you
I need to introduce you
 Dont you touch me
 Ill take that You guys make your way in
 Theres a handful of folks here You see
three very very old farmertypes that this is
their retirement is coming here everyday and
complaining and drinking themselves to an early
earlier grave You do see two crownsguard that
are working their way slowly through an ale and
chatting to each other As he walks in Hey and
Oh whats up hey buddy Youre walking around
thats great Hes like  Yeah Ive
got a job for you Whats your name again
 Beau this is Jordan and Jay Theyre going
to go ahead and help you out with this
How much are you paying
 Its to Alfield and back Its an escort
 You see the gentleman who was introduced as
Jordan goes Well to and from Alfield thats a
number of days travel including night camping
costs board staying there in Alfield Id say
for the each of us roundtrip puts you at
about  gold pieces
 Youre a hard negotiator I respect that
Its a deal
 Okay
 Where did you meet this woman Hes like
Look shes been this way but she pays well
apparently and I want to help you guys out Im
going to go lay back down
and he starts making his way back with your stick
 I missed the deal who are we escorting
 Edith
 All right I got it No worries we got it
taken care of We got you taken care of
Were good Were just going to finish our drinks
and well start getting our stuff together
 Geoff has made his way partially back
to Demis place with your staff
 Oh jeez Okay
  What is wrong with you
 Huh
 I dont like you
 Okay He makes his way back Youve hired
some crownsguards under the table to keep an eye
and escort Edith and Luke over to Alfield to meet
with Bryce where theyre going to take care of
them to some degree
 Yes what do you do
 Make a perception check
 Fjord
 Your head turns to the left and youre like
Where are those that cloud looks like an eagle
You Caduceus do a pretty fair look around
You do not recognize anyone that resembles
the figures in question
 There are elves around but maybe two or
three since youve come here
 There arent many elves in
Felderwin Most of the Empire elves
are further northward in the Zemni Fields
Youve seen a few and a handful of
half elves but none of the type that
you are looking for
These are not the elves youre looking for
 Okay Would you like to buy more pockets
Or pouches
 I mean unless youre walking around like
Rob Liefeld character
 Yeah and you grow more and more teeth
 Your feet vanish
 Easy enough You head over to the Felderwin
General helmed by Dupont Briggsman this young
dwarven salesman Tanned skin light brown hair
a bit of a chin beard He says
Are you looking for pockets you said
 Well belt pouches Ive got money belts
if thats what youre looking for
 Ive got something that you could probably
affix that would be similar maybe
 So just the two
 Lets say eight silver
 All right there you go Passes it over
 Make a sleight of hand check for me
 He is happily picking out and handing over
belt pouches as you completely disorganize his
probably very carefully and intentionally placed
system Well done
 You sense a faint smile over your shoulder
 All right making your way oh
 Oh yes You see each tunnel has somewhere in
the neighborhood of five to six guards stationed
to each Some of them are just sitting down bored
with their posting Theyve been told to keep
watch but not a whole lots happening until you
guys approach Youre heading towards the center
tunnel which is the one that already has the
fairly deep dig and as you approach the guards
all stand up Some of them are holding spears and
are using them to get to their feet They look
over in your direction These are not the same
guards you spoke to last night
 The width of the tunnel as it is 
the carts going to be a very tight fit
let alone getting two horses to pull it
for you underground
 They all look at each other and one of them
who looks probably to have a little more authority
who has probably been assigned to be the head of
the rest of the crownsguard steps forward
and goes Yeah what of it
 And by whose guidance are you assigned to
do this
 Theyve signed authority
 You make a deception check you make an
intimidation check
 Made in Felderwin
 Yes The guy looks at both of you and his
chestpuffed moment of bravado begins to slowly
deflate and goes Right okay What are you
looking to do You just inspecting
 Yeah yeah I dont really
 No
 Oh just do your thing
 He steps aside The other guards theyre
eyeing you close they still have a job to do
They dont trust you implicitly but at least
theyre stepping out of your path to let you
go about what business youre attending to
 You can climb down because it starts off
pretty decent Wheres the cart being left
Or are you bringing it down with you
 Okay The cart has been set at the inn then
Are you prepurchasing board for it
 I mean it can stay there as long as youre
renting rooms there but if you just want it to be
kept there its a little bit cheaper but you
still have to pay in advance for how long you
intend to leave it there for storage
 Right You come back and talking to 
Simone Deepwell hes like
All right so three weeks youre saying
 A month Okay Just the cart and the horse
All right Ill go ahead and talk to Babs about
holding the horse we can go to
 Oh okay Well for board on that its
going to run about three silver a night
Well say for  nights itll be
 Thats  silver so nine gold pieces for
the month
  Back up to the point
You guys make yourselves down into the tunnel
Three guards do follow behind at a distance just
keeping an eye on what youre doing
 Oh shit Into
 Okay hold on here
 A beast of any challenge rating that is
equal to or less than the target
So it can be a CR seven or lower
 Actually technically because as you guys
rested for the evening and youve completed your
journey here and youve begun this next venture
technically for the night you guys would hit level eight
 This is a heads up
 Well deal with that shortly but for the time
being a CR eight or smaller beast you could be
 You go to Monsters and you would choose Beast
 Then for the CR range you would put from
Id say for safety one to eight
 Welcome to the world of the druid
 Look up from levels one to eight
 You know what Laura make an
intelligence check
 Okay There are beasts in the wild There
are wolves there are cats there are bears
Youve run across a number of larger versions of
these more dangerous and ominous ones like when
you were in the Savalierwood briefly you came
across a few dire wolves Use your creative mind
on what other possible dire creatures might exist
 You can try it
 Whether or not one exists the creative
imagination of Jester creates a Polymorph form as
you watch her body expand and extend into a
massive honey badger maybe six feet from nose
to tail tip with a series of bony protrusions
that run down its back like two spines
Large teeth and claws that definitely arc and
curve outward to about five six inches
beyond the center of the paw unretracted
 You watch as the guards take a step back
like Uh
 How long does that last It lasts for an
hour
 No you are a dire honey badger
 All right I will say go ahead and make an
athletics check for me adding what would be the
honey badgers strength a dire honey badger
Ill say plus three So roll a d add plus three
 Its going to take you its a good period of
time here of you carving through and taking a break
 You wouldve had to cast it in advance but
Ill say in watching this happen Bless only
lasts a minute but for that time period you get
a little further and well say you start getting
more and more exhausted and then you reach a
certain point where the spell expires and your
form reverts to a very sweaty exhausted Jester
Youve carved quite a way Youve pushed probably
an additional in the past hour Oh man
Another hundred or so feet into the tunnel
 Im going to go check right now for you
 At level eight you get a second thlevel slot
  Back into your dire
honey badger form
 Go ahead and make another athletics check
Add plus three plus a d
 Ten Okay
 Anyway
 You push on for the next  or  or so
minutes getting an additional   feet
before eventually one of your paws goes through
You carve through and you reach
the other side of this collapsed tunnel
 As the molten l No Im kidding
 No
 Weve all made this mistake Taliesin
 Granite granite
 Make a perception check
  As you look past theres no light
source in there and the hole is only large enough
for you to kind of fit your torso through as you
glance in But in the distance you can see
What is the distance on your darkvision  feet
 Pretty sure its  feet Its a pretty
standard  feet for
 Got you The tunnel widens and drops off
like a cliff You hear a very very faint sound
It sounds like running water
 Theyre behind you yeah
 Dont want to run into that CR creature
 Youre not there
 You guys are all back in the tunnel Its
been dug through and all of a sudden Jester
creates a small hole and then plugs it with
herself You just see the back of Jester halfway
stuck almost like Winnie the Pooh trying to exit
the domicile
 Okay globes appear By the way Im trying
to remember Did you guys take the gray vial
with you or did you leave it behind
 Got you Cool
 Before we moved on I just want to make
sure
 The globes appear Are you on the other side
of the chamber
 Did you go through the hole
 Correct
 All right You step through and bloom
bloom bloom the orbs appear and it illuminates
the chamber And it is a chamber What youve
stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern
About  or  feet ahead of you it drops off and
looks to be about a tenfoot drop before it hits
another straightaway As it curves to the left
youve already smelled the minerals and the
hard water smell of the interior of this chamber
You glance over to the side and let the orbs drift
over a little further and you can see a river
Its an underground river and it seems to have
carved its way through this lower portion of the
chamber It vanishes further below into
 Make a perception check
 Coast looks clear
 But you also notice as the orbs move
through there are crystallike I want to say
like quartz crystals that jut from certain
portions of the ceiling and elements of various
 Ive taught myself a million times since I
was a kid and it always transposes
 I know Im always like Ugh never right
Stalactites that come down quite a bit from about
a foothigh ceiling from where youre standing
that almost reach the floor where you are
But over this point where it hangs
Or where it ends and goes further below
Do you send the orbs out further
 Are you all going through
 As youre doing this the one guard is
Oh hey uh
 Make a deception check
 Its riding a line Ill allow persuasion
Only because youre being vague enough with it
that youre riding the line
 He goes Okay I guess just give us a
holler if something goes down
 Give a loud holler Were going to probably
scoot back this is a bit creepy
 
 Well good luck
 Okay He turns around the guards start
leaving You hear this very faint echoing voice
going Theyre fucking crazy
 So you guys make your way through the tunnel
and join Caleb
 As you all step into the interior you can
also take in that smell of longsealed underground
water hearing the rushing of the small river You
can see where the path continues on and with the
dim glow and the darkvision where it curves
forward you can see a faint natural arch that
looks to be a continuation of the tunnel
 Make a nature check
 Seven Probably
 Make a perception check
 This is perception because youre looking at
things in the distance as opposed to
carefully checking whats on the floor
  Does not appear to be trapped
 As you guys begin to step forward into the
darkened subterranean shadows of this newly
discovered tunnel system and wherever it will lead
you eastward were going to go ahead and
end tonights episode there
 Yes you should
 Thats what I want out of my
Dungeons  Dragons experience
 You take a d die Sam youve played this
game for
 You reroll ones
 There you go thats better
 Man Six six six Oh oh
 Its six plus your constitution modifier
but when you level up it should add that
automatically in DD Beyond
 Yeah So you just add the number you rolled
 Yeah you guys get to choose to either
add plus two to one of your ability scores
or plus one to two different scores
or choose a feat
 Thisll give you a week to consider
you dont have to consider it right now
 Spell Sniper
 Yeah your melee attacks do
additional poison damage
 It does not help your healing distance
unfortunately
 Its attack spells
 Spells that have an attack roll thats the
but it doesnt affect your healing
 Correct
 It doesnt break the game its
just slightly OP
 Well see what people say Anyway you guys
have a week to decide Put some thought to it
And for the rest of us thank you for tuning in
for this emotional rollercoaster of a fucking episode
Well see you soon enough Until then have
a wonderful week we love you and
is it Thursday yet
 Good night guys


 So last we left off the Mighty Nein had found
their way back from the Menagerie Coast to check
in with some friends and the general chaos
brewing based on the conflict between the empire
and the Kryn Dynasty Upon traveling making your
way towards the city of Felderwin a city involved
with Notts history you discovered that this
apothecary that had burned to the ground belonged
to a male halfling who has now gone missing and
discovered that Nott had a little boy
After learning about Notts history learned more
than that You learned that Nott at one point was
indeed a halfling Through a vengeful plot by the
goblins that stalk the southeastern regions of the
empires Marrow Valley she managed to help her
family escape but was drowned and then
reincarnated by some sort of a hooded power figure
that had an alliance with these goblins it
seemed Brought back as a goblin and has been
living as such for the better part of two years now
Upon asking around the city and getting some
information you discovered that the husband of
Nott or Veth if you will has been apparently
taken by the Kryn and had some involvement with
his alchemical studies with the Cerberus Assembly
and this study of dunamis You acquired a few
objects from a subterranean basement laboratory
that was mostly trashed apparently in the razing
of the city
You then decided to go and inspect the tunnels
where these Kryn emerged from One of them
apparently was still somewhat intact Deciding to
not be balked by a sheer wall of stone and rock
Jester proceeded to twice Polymorph herself into a
dire honey badger and burrow her way through
hundreds and hundreds of feet of rock emerging on
the rest of this uncollapsed burrowed tunnel of a
large worm creature they had used to attack
without warning the city of Felderwin
As you the Mighty Nein had made your way beyond
that boundary and began to step into this
subterranean cavern system stalking and seeking
the path that these individuals took here beneath
the surface we begin tonights game First off
how would you like to prepare What is your
marching order Let me know what your plan is now
going in to the sheer dark underground beneath
the Marrow Valley
 Not frustration
 Theyre not knives
 Well first off a marching order These
tunnels here can range between brief bits of
cavern and open chambers to following this carved
worm tunnel which is about ten feet wide and is
cylindrical You can have at most two people
shouldertoshoulder going through each place I
would like to know for the majority of this
journey and tell me when you want to change it
up at any point I want to know what your
marching order is traveling through here
 We have Caleb and Caduceus towards the
center
 Go look
 There you go Yasha and Beau at the front
Behind that Caleb and Caduceus Whos behind them
 So Fjord and Jester at the front Then
Nott youre taking the back
 So then wheres Yasha
 Dont apologize Its okay were figuring
this out
 Okay yeah if you would like to have taken
your
 I dont have the mini on me at the moment
I can do that at the break However as youve
worked out your grouping traveling through these
tunnels you go on for an hour two hours
Those at the front which would be you two Id
like you both to make a perception check please
 So youre helping
 Keeping a watch as you guys progress the
faint perpetual decline goes deeper and deeper
beneath the earth The rushing sounds of the
underground river that seems to be walking
alongside this passageway slowly fades as you see
the river now pass beneath stone the cavern come
to an end and the entrance of the next portion of
the tunnel where the worm creature had to burrow
into this chamber There are natural pockets of
cavernous areas here but a lot of them arent
connected except for by this particular burrowed
tunnel So thats probably going to be the path
youre going to be looking for
wherever youre traveling
 Yasha stares ahead for a moment and goes
Having been to places like the coast
its not very nice
 Rolling your perception you dont see
anything aside from the natural formations
Theres the smell of hard water and wet earth that
permeates the entirety of this chamber and
continuing on for quite some time The natural
chambers and pathways here are chained together by
these tunnels but within them it doesnt look
from anything youve seen so far is lived in You
dont see signs of any other creatures making
homes or nests You do see bits of quartzlike
crystal forming from gathered minerals over time
 A series of stalactites and stalagmites that
find their way through the see Thank you guys
for your help
 Yes Just keep giving me suggestions Really
figured it out Its not condescending at all
 Make a survival check
 Yeah the previous tunnel
 Yeah based on looking at the ground here
which is mostly packed dirt and general loose
pieces of pebbles and things that were pushed and
ground around by the creature that made its way
through the area In its wake you can see familiar
footfalls similar to the shape that youd
previously seen that didnt match the rest of the
crownsguard andor the Righteous Brand that
existed in the vicinity of Felderwin You do
notice the trail the tracks of the Kryn warriors
that had exited and it does lead and follow the
burrowing path of the worm
 Its about ten feet wide Eight to ten feet
wide
 No roll a nature check
 You have no idea if sheeps pupils are
square
 All right
 You push on What little light you have
shoving back the darkness via the dull orb that
Caleb is carrying in the center of the heart of
your traveling troupe you leave that first
winding cavern and begin to continue down the
burrowed hallway created by this worm It
stretches on for a mile two miles five miles
 Sure Make a perception check
 Walking along the things you do notice is
the stone and earth seems fairly smooth the way
its pushed through but getting up close you can
see tiny little scrapes or hooks where you gather
is probably how the creature manages to break
through and push its way through through
expanding and contracting muscles within its long
body and these spine or scalelike protrusions
that dig in and pull it along rather quickly
underground Beyond figuring out the locomotion of
this entity this creature you dont along this
part of the journey at least yet see any signs of
purposeful markings essentially Continuing on
for the next five to six hours still following
this tunnel starting to get a little tired
 If I recall it was somewhere around midday
a little after noon
 Id say at this time its probably close to
dusk on the surface Fucking feat
 I know its in the book
 You passed water in the first cavern that
you went through That lasted for maybe about a
mile or so The bulk of it weaving through where a
lot of the water passing through that river carved
through the rock over time but then eventually
that trailed off and this burrow was the only
other path to take Youve been there for a number
of hours now
 You keep pressing on All right A few more
hours pass People at the front roll perception
checks for me please
 Good to know You had a question for
Caduceus you said
 You continue on for another hour or so You
do come to another chamber but its only about 
by  feet wide and its a heavy geode It looks
like there are a locked piece a pocket of old
stale air that was opened up as this worm burrowed
through You can see broken crystals of many
beautiful colors a lot of them milky white
quartzlike a few that are almost a purple
amethyst tint to it
 Its a beautiful prism As you see the
entire room is a scattering of shades of purple
pink and strangely orange It refracts the
light in a way you havent seen before and for
the moment this dark ominous space becomes this
beautiful disco
 Make a perception check
 Just a perception check
 You take a moment and listen to the quiet
No sound No vibration
 Yes on the edges of it However where the
worm had burrowed through theres a part of the
ground thats digging into a divot The interior
of the geodes been carved out in that space
 There are small bits maybe like two or
threefeet pockets but a large portion of this
little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal
 Yes Quite a bit of it has been cracked
and broken
 Make a nature check for me
 A lot of this appears to be natural crystal
Its not a particular gemstone or anything really
precious per se Youre sure you could probably
there are uses for it Some people like to use
them as focuses for healing and for general decor
Simple cheap jewelry can be made from this as well
 Yeah there you go
 Okay Youre not sure what the worth is
You havent delved in the realm of selling or
purchasing crystals in the street before but you
imagine depending on the person you could
probably get a little bit of coin for it
 What are you doing
 Yeah You couldnt cover the entire dome
but you could definitely create a portion of it
thats in a shell
 You essentially diffuse element of that
rock away from it to create the shell on the
opposite side Totally doable You create a hut
 You guys take your evenings rest
 Theres a pause Then the voice comes
through Well I would say it is not advised to
give it up to pull it out of your bag But
who am I to keep you from taking an artifact
into the heart of danger
 You have a high enough wisdom to know
that there was a hint of biting sarcasm to his
statement but interpret that as you will
 Now is everyone taking a comfortable
evenings rest within the hut
 You do have a pretty decent setup between
the Tiny Hut and the Alarm threads
 Okay You guys all find yourself to rest
here deep beneath the surface of Exandria For
some of you dreams come For some of you no
its a clean sleeptowake experience until
eventually you slowly come to consciousness
feeling rested though strange to not have a day
or night cycle Nothing has changed from your
experience You feel like youve rested but have
you It could have been an hour it could have
been eight hours Being this far beneath the
surface for an extended period of time is going
to be a little strange for those of you who have
not had that experience which is all of you
 You would know thats a good question
Let me look it up real fast
 You always know the number of hours left
before the next sunrise or sunset Id say yeah
youd be able to tell everyone Even just
informing everyone of the time its still
 You can say it and be like
 Oh yeah guys
No issues Nothing has changed Frumpkin did not
notice anything out of the ordinary As the hut
comes to a close and you step out from behind the
somewhat created stone shell placed by Caduceus
the tunnel is yours
 You got it As Frumpkin keeps you
warm in the throat region
you all continue onward Same order
 Those helming the charge at the
front either each take an individual
perception check or you may
help for advantage
 Mage Armor yeah good call
 Nice A few more miles of winding tunnel
continue before you and its a very trying
monotonous experience where its lengths of
time and travel where theres no real change
in topography Slight variations as it winds in
this natural shifting with the physicality of the
creature that burrowed it but its this
cylindrical of stone and earth for hours
and hours until you catch the next first glimpse
of another chamber opening before you
 You do not see any movement As you get a
little closer you can begin to see the interior
of the chamber near where it opens up inside The
air here is already pretty chilly here beneath
the surface The air has more moisture to it than
the tunnel youve been traveling through
You can smell a bit of that heavy mineral
subterranean water scent You listen in for
a second and you can hear the subtle dripping
of condensation probably from the ceiling
which means theres probably a nearby water
source somewhere in the vicinity
There is a chamber that opens up ahead of you
 Roll stealth checks for me please
 Pass Without a Trace Good call
 Did you roll for Yasha as well
 Moving into the chamber as it opens in
you can see this area has quite a heavy clustering
of stalagmites and stalactites all across the
interior of this chamber It opens up maybe
 or so feet wide and it seems to curve around
this large bend Elements of it rise While you
do not see a river looking up at where the
waters dripping from you get the sense
there might be a large body of water not that
far above Elements of the groundwater are
trickling through and elements are gathering
to create the interior of this chamber
 Yes You know where north is
 You dont have a GPS per se but
you know where north is
 Right so you have a vague idea Youve
been traveling for a day from Felderwin right
So its about say  miles in a day
Youd be about there This vicinity here
so youre right in this vicinity
 There are the heavy stalagmites and
rock protrusions from the ground that
litter the interior of the chamber as it
curves off to the side
 You cannot see where the worm went through
 Cant see the other side It looks like
the worm when it entered this chamber
you dont see in your vicinity where it
may have continued to burrow
 You get the sense that maybe this creature
and the people that were steering it
were leading it through whatever open
chambers were possible and then only
burrowing when there was no continuation
 Make a survival check
 Youre looking for
 Okay so both of you are looking for
essentially signs of things
 Okay Perception check and then
survival check from each of you
  Okay
 Thats better All right Looking around
you continue to see the footfalls the footprints
along the patches of ground where it seems like
dirt and dust has been settled in areas that are
a little bit wet from the moisture in the air You
can see some of these grimy recesses in the muck
and the dirt that is similar to the footfalls
youve already seen in previous chambers of what
appears to be of the Kryn You can see some of the
stone formations in the ground Two of them appear
to be broken and pushed over where it looks like
the creature may have shoved its way through
It goes around the edge and then curves up out of
sight You can try to continue to look in that
direction but from what you can see the
vicinity thats the path its taking
You were looking for
 Holes in the wall All right Looking around
the vicinity you dont see any holes in the wall
You do see there are elements in the rock where
there are cracks and you can see where small bits
of water are slowly dribbling through and then

 Theyre pretty decent
 Perfect So you paint a little figure
of the
 So youre watching the entrance
 Okay So yeah as you walk over there
there is an area where it curves in then rises up
a little bit To the left you can see a
small pool of water where its gathered
and created this little tucked in the side pool
maybe fivefoot by  feet
 Go ahead and get close to it
it looks clear It looks very
 You can see the bottom it looks to be no
more than have five six feet deep You can see
where it continues up off to that side
Jester finishes painting the statue
You look around for somewhere to place it
There are a number of these larger
rock formations five ten feet tall eightfoot
tall little squat ones What do you want
 Okay
 Perfect All right Shes writing that down
You were at the front
 Whos watching the back
 All right Perception check both of you
guys just to make sure youre keeping watch
 All right you watch the distant path the
dark that continues curving up off to the side
You look over there No movement Youre looking
towards the tunnel where you guys came from
No movement You hear the chuckles and look back
at what theyre doing You see one of these
stalagmites these tendrils 
Need to roll initiative

 Actually only you need to roll
initiative because they
 Get a surprise round
 By this little tiny squat one
 You were over on this side
looking off this way
 Nott were you helping them out
 Beau is right there
 Yasha will be keeping an eye not noticing
Caleb where were you
 All right then
 So Initiative orders  to 
 I just said roll initiative
 Just so we have it
 Okay  to 
 Its fine
 All right  to ten
 Then we have Jester at the bottom
 So Fjord You go first
 Youre the only one who noticed them in
this scenario Because you were the one whos
closest to the actual Caduceus is facing on the
back side of the chamber What are you doing
 Yep Two of them You see that one and go
Shit Shit And you see them both go 
 All righty
 Go for it Roll attacks for each
 It  just dissipates without
effect across its rocky armored surface
 Sure
 Which one This one
 All right
  No effect You watch as
the Eldritch energy the green burst just
scatters across its rocky exterior
No impact
 You all of a sudden heard a  and
you heard him shout as you turn around and saw
Fjord shout Big trouble and then vanish behind
a nearby rock Like a hero
 I know In this moment of realization
of whats happening these two large
stalagmites suddenly have a single eye
that opens in the center this burning red
orangeish eye with a vertical slit The
center of it opens up into this large
gaping mouth of sharpened teeth and a
liquid tongue on the inside thats
slimying around These four tendrils
that unravel So its now their turn
Its going to move there Five ten
 They shift it looks like theyre
gliding but theres thousands of tiny cilia
underneath that just cause them to glide
across the ground This one on this end is
going to go ahead and make three attacks
Each can make four tendril attacks
 Yes So
 Jester that is a  to hit
 All right You are grappled
 While youre grappled you are restrained
and have disadvantage on strength checks
Theres one now to Beau Thats going 
to be a  to hit
 Against Beau again thats going
to be a  to hit
 So you are grappled
 Yep
 Well say youre grappled Beau
Youre also grappled Im putting
restrained there because you are technically
restrained as well Against Nott
 Yep As it  out that way
that ones going to be 
 Misses You just duck underneath
The fourth ones going to swing out
towards you as well Thats going to be a 
 You are also grappled
 Correct
 You can try and escape it Its an
action to try and escape from the grapple
You can still attack but youre restrained
so you have disadvantage on your attacks
 Its your athletics or acrobatics
you choose
 Now its going to go ahead and make
a bite attack against Jester because
youre the closest one to it Since youre
restrained it has advantage on the attack
Its a natural  and a three So natural 
it is So thats going to be Ooh oh no
  points of piercing damage from
the critical hit as its tendril pulls you
in towards its mouth shoves your shoulder
and the side of your neck into it and it
grinds down onto you The armor pulls in
and you can feel it piercing the back of
your neck Sharp pain arcs through your body
 This one here is going to go ahead
and go for Caleb for an attack
 Thats going to be a  to hit
 Shield  It actually almost grabs
you and in the last minute you throw your hand up
and an arcane barrier flashes in front and
the tentacle gets knocked off limply Yes
 Yes you may
 Go for it
 Hes got three more tendril attacks
 Each round they get four each
 Yep
 Havent encountered adventurers
in a while buddy
 I admire your creativity
 d damage As it bites into you
you angrily focus
 And whats its save
 Dex save Haha a two
 The damage definitely takes
 These ice crystals suddenly
apparate around its mouth where it bit into
Jester and it seems to pull back a bit
its eye closes and winces with the impact
Now its other attacks Its second attack
against you Caleb Thats going to be
an  to hit
 Because the Shields still up
 Deflects the second attack
 Third ones going to go for Caduceus
 It has a foot range on its tendrils

 Reaches out Thats going to be a 
 All right
 Now you are also grappled
 Well you are considered grappled but
while youre grappled you are restrained
which means you have disadvantage on
attacks You also have disadvantage on
strength checks and strength saving throws
 You cannot move your speed is zero
 Its fourth and final tendril its going to
go ahead and shoot for Caleb again Natural 
 Yeah
 Well it still hits but it doesnt
 Right it doesnt do any damage
The tendril is just a
 Right it gets one bite attack per
turn but it grapples each of you
Just letting you know you probably
want to hold onto that
 Thats okay You are also grappled
there Caleb and restrained
 Its going to use reel
 Pulls Caduceus into it
and Caleb into it
 Its going to make an attack against
you As you are restrained attack rolls
against you have advantage A two and a one
motherfuck It goes towards to bite you
and the shield is still holding and its
pulling you in towards its mouth but
you see the barrier pressing and bits of
its rock exterior are cracking
being pressed up against this shield
 All right surprise rounds done
Top of the round Beau youre up first
 You are currently grappled and
restrained You have no movement
 Well technically you are adjacent
to it because youre both right there
and its in this space You and
Jester are both adjacent to it
 Yes you can hit it Nott it did not
reel you in that turn because I forgot
it can do the reel as part of its action
 Your attacks have disadvantage
by the way because youre restrained
 Miss That two attacks so far
 The first attack you cant quite get
your hand free You manage to get it free
for a second attack and it hits the rock
No impact Still have your bonus action
 She rolled low
 You can disengage but you still have no
movement You have to escape from it to gain your
movement speed back Right now youre wrapped
up by its tendril and you cant go anywhere
 No Disengage prevents attacks of
opportunity but you cannot get away
from it to even trigger one
 Fjord youre on deck with Yasha
after that You can use your action
to try and break free yeah
 There you go Flurry of Blows get two
more strikes on it each with disadvantage
  just hits The first one doesnt
even get out the second one hits the rock
and hurts You get your other arm free and
 into the stone again This time
you look down as the eye opens up and you
see the eye and go  right into the
center of its giant glowing eye
Roll damage on that one
 Thats the end of your turn
 Cool That brings us to Fjord
 You can do stunning strike if you
want to but thats up to you
 Yeah even when you attack on your
Flurry of Blows as long as you hit with
an attack you can do that
 All right spend another ki point
Constitution save its a natural one
Motherfuck
 Well take this stunned token
and put it on this one
 Thats Hex
 Correct Now Fjord you can take
your turn As you take your turn you look
over and watch as Beau plunges her fist into
the eye of this living stalagmite and it
starts suddenly wriggling in place
It looks like its having a rough time
 Your attacks have advantage on it
because it is stunned yes
 That hits
 Got you  just barely misses
unfortunately
 You rush up with one attack carve
across with the scimitar and you expect it
to completely deflect the blow but the blade
does cut through the rock Where it splits
where the blade was there is a muscly
fleshy interior The creature is heavily
armored by the shell its created around
itself but its definitely mortal Your
second strike however glides against the 
outside of its rocky shell and makes no damage
 All right Right there
 I would say because you can only
Misty Step to places you can see you can
go there but you have five feet of
movement left so you move there anyways
Just as a point of reference That ends
Fjords turn Yashas up
 Go for it
 All righty
That is a natural  for the first one
and the second one is only a ten
 That first hit all the impact and
might smashes into this creatures face
and she pulls back and Thats all I had
 Times two you mean
 Any bonuses on top of that
  points of damage from that first strike
as the Magicians Judge carves down through it
One of the tentacles gets damaged and you can
see it still holding tight but starting to wear
this thing down Still looking okay
though That finishes Yashas turn
 Theyre after the ropers Theyre right
before you guys Theyre squeezed right between
Yasha and your trios turn This one here is
going to reel in Nott Now you get pulled
 Oh that ones stunned so it cant Never
mind That one right there is going to attempt to
ensnare with one of its free tendrils
Yasha That is going to be a  to hit
 It hits She is also now grappled
and restrained Its going to make
a bite attack against Caleb
 You have to break free
 Thats another natural 
 Reaction from Caduceus to whats
the ability called again Channel Divinity
 Was it once per short rest
 Grave clerics man Thats awesome
 Well be thankful he reduced
that critical  points of piercing damage
as it jams your entire arm into its mouth
and its starting to pull you in from the
torso up The other one is stunned and does
not get its turn That brings us to the trio
 Hes already going Hes already on it
 Whats the save
 What is it wisdom
 This is for the guy over there
 He is slowed
 That guy is a 
 Theyre both slowed
 Yeah a fan sent those actually
 Youve got it Caleb thats your go
 Casting frantically with the offhand
Their whipping tendrils that are wrapping
you all of a sudden go 
Its chewing on Caleb is like 
 Jesters still part way in like
Oh god Slow chews Nott or Caduceus
 Whats the save
 Charisma Oh they are not charismatic
 There is a  and a zero
 Yeah youve got it
 Caduceus is pulled in manages to
curse them both with this divine power
pulled from the Wildmothers darker side of
nature and then holds the staff up through
A burst of insects beetles then fly out
of it clouding around this central
stalagmite and begin to assault
the opposite side of the creature
 It is still stunned so you have
advantage on your attack
 Its stunned until Beaus next turn
  just hits because of the Slow
spell Their AC is reduced by two
 No its just d
 Ten is the average damage
 Ten points of damage The beetles are
now biting into the side of this entity
That finish your turn
 Youve got it
 It is stunned yes
  misses It ricochets off of its
rocklike hide The bolt goes scattering
off into the shadows somewhere
 Go for it
 They appear to be of similar material
They have a similar look to them
but theyre flexible so theyre
probably not as
  does hit and it is adjacent
well its stunned anyway
so you do get your sneak attack damage on it
 All the dice
  points of damage nice As the first bolt
ricochets you see a spark as the rocklike
exterior shoots it off As its sitting there
 with its one eye open its jaw still
chewing on Jester Jester manages to wedge herself
out of its mouth just in time for you to aim the
bolt into its throat It begins to cough a bit
of its own blood Its looking pretty hurt
 That ends your turn Nott
 Jester youre up
 Oh shit
 It rolled a natural  minus two

 This guy vanishes The tendrils are no
longer around you so none of them are
 Youre all of a sudden released from it
and the creatures just not there anymore
 Right because youre still
wrapped up by its tendrils
 Beau youre up
 It is stunned until the end of your
next turn I believe right
 You still have advantage on the
attacks You have disadvantage
because youre restrained so its just
a straight roll for you
 Go for it
  misses Youre punching a rock
and its hurting
but youre going to get through
Looking for those soft spots
 Yes that hits
 Seven points of damage
 That is an  so it resists it
 Thats minus two to it so its a 
Whats your DC
 Yeah so it resists it
 I saw it
  points of damage on that strike As
you jam the staff into the middle of its mouth
and are prying it open you get down and
see where its eye is trying to keep closed
and the moment it flicks open to be aware of
its surroundings you whack poking it right there
  just hits because of the Slow spell
  points of damage Oof this thing
is not having a great moment
 Fjord youre up
 Both hit Damn nice It is no
longer stunned Actually did you roll
with advantage or did you roll regularly
 Good Its no longer stunned so you
do not have advantage on the attack
 How do you want to do this

 You see Fjord holding the pose there
for a second as Beaus holding its tongue
and the tongue comes out You look past
and watch as its eye goes limp
and it shifts off into three separate pieces
 You guys book it
 Ropers man
 Yep
 You can add a roper tongue to your
inventory
 There you go Thats the other inventory
 Its pretty tough
 Strangely salty Its the minerals
As you guys are rushing up around the edge
the cavern ends about another  or  feet
up front It just ends
 Jester make a perception check
 Youre looking around and the tracks
that you noticed earlier you guys pick up on
and you see that it is still traveling this
direction You can glance at the area
though the wall itself is this surface of
loose rock and stone formations there
 Following the tracks there is an
area where it looks like the stones are
just loosely there Part of the wall fell
in and covered the interior
but you can pull stones out of it
 Okay so you start pulling stones
out and passing them off Some of them are
pretty heavy Yasha is helping You guys
are pulling them out one by one You get a
small section of opening available to you
It wasnt a huge collapse It looks like
when it was passing through it might have
bumped into the wall and caused a portion
of it to fall in and its only the lack of
light in here thats really making it hard
to originally even notice this exit
You get halfway through it before you
hear  in the room behind you
 Yes
 Go for it It moves very slow You
glance back in the area and it goes 
It moves ten feet a round and youre about
a hundred feet from it around that way
 Itll be about another minute before
it gets within range  That hits
Technically its still No its not slowed
anymore because Slow has worn off
 Right its been banished for a minute
  Go for it
 You can still attack from a distance Its
about a hundred now its  feet from you
 Go for it
 Yasha and Beau are moving rocks
Make an athletics check for me
Make an athletics check for Yasha
Yeah shes good
  hits
 Its not in range yet Its  feet
from you
 Roll for attack
 All right thats as far as you can get
Youre up against the wall now
 You have to roll attack for that
 Yeah that hits
  points of radiant damage and
its also glowing The next attack on it
has advantage It moves forward again
It is now  feet from you
 Go for it
 Thats the way to do it
  damage for you  from you
  hits yeah And  damage
 All right Its taking hits and
slowly moving towards you It feels like
the old s scifi movie with the weird
carrot looking creatures that these are
loosely based on visually This is like a
dude in a suit trying to scoot it forward
They dont chase very well ropers
 Okay go for it
 You got it
 But its advantage because the
well no because you already used
the Guiding Bolt Thats right
 Theres a burst of powder and smoke
Youve never fired a firearm Its still a
relatively new technology for most people
outside of the main military and even then
theyve only been producing them out of
Hupperdook for the past ten years So your
first time really using this and yeah
the ringings in your ears your hand
feels numb from the blowback Not great
It  off of the front of it
 Now its  feet
 A natural  on its save
 That is a 
 Yep Roll damage
 Ooh So both hits one with a crit
That first attacks a crit Double
 Very next round
 Okay Mighty Nein
how do you want to do this
 With vague interest Its starting
to loom forward 
 It goes limp It gets really tense
for a second and then really sad and is
like okay Its dead
 At this point in time Beau and Yasha
have managed to pull enough rocks out of
that tunnel to make it large enough for each
of you and Fjord to squeeze through
You can step through each of you and
eventually find yourself on the other side
The burrowed tunnel continues
ahead of you into darkness
 Strange gnomish engineering thats
still in the early development stages
 Continuing down the familiar
monotonous carved tunnel If youre
keeping the same order make your perception
checks keeping a watch out front
 Nice You move on for the remainder
of the day before getting to a point where
youre starting to get a little tired and you
figure you can continue to push on if you
want to but youll begin to push into
possible exhaustion territory Youve now
hit what would be a full days worth of
travel and this burrowed tunnel continues
on Youve found one chamber and then
passed it so at least you know theres
probably more to come in the level you are
currently traveling in but this days
travel after that last encounter
you have not found another chamber
 Nope But the good news is as long as
you have this tunnel you know
at least youre probably on the right track
 Okay And the width of that is
 I think it might be a bit large to
carve the whole thing
 Tenfoot radius yeah So you can carve part
of it and itll still be partially exposed but
he can color it as he wants and with the
stone itll help somewhat camouflage it
 So you guys spend the evening
Another long rest
Roll perception for Frumpkin for the evening
if you dont mind
 Okay
 Theres a brief pause and then Ah
No they just have me in a room We havent
been traveling underground since we got out
but they have me in the city now
 Perception for Frumpkin
 Good to know The evening goes by Frumpkin
does notice throughout the evening some movement
what seemed to be the stalagmitetype roper
creatures who you had fought before but a little
smaller scooting along the ceiling It made it
through the tunnel over top of you guys and then
continued on without noticing or caring about the
location where you had placed and camouflaged your
evenings rest The next morning comes to
You continue traveling All right Keeping a
watch out Laura please as Jester roll your
perception check Its a long subterranean journey
for me doing daytoday here Im sorry
 Okay You got a keen eye out there
in front of you
 This day is the hardest so far because
it is an entire eightplus hours of just
winding tunnel Once again that continuous
pace It seems to dip at times and then
it picks up It has its own organic shifting
to it in small bits but it is a day of travel
of that same tenfoot wide continuous
tunnel and it is maddening
 Perfect
 All right That days travel goes by
uneventful So day three is done
do you guys set up camp once more
here in the tunnel
 Okay
 I think so
 She loves a lot
 All you hear is I cant
 So you settle in for your third evening
here underground
 I would hope so because your provisions
are going to run out pretty quickly otherwise
 Divine mac and cheese Doesnt taste divine
just is divine
 Maybe tomorrow So same set up
Evenings rest Frumpkins keeping watch
Go ahead and roll perception check
for Frumpkin
 Six okay good to know
 As the evening goes on
Frumpkin doesnt notice anything
 You wake up Your fourth day begins
You gather your things and begin to trek
even further into this single
perpetual tunnel
 This is just an overall penalty to stealth

 Both you and Jester both make
perception checks
 Travis
 Fjord at this point trying to ignore that
and facing forward is continuing The path this
protracted tunnel you begin to notice smaller
tunnels intersecting with it
 Like one on the side one a little higher
 All right
 You look up and you can see They are maybe
about two three feet wide each From what you can
see the entrance to the first one on the right
thats on the right side a lot of dirt and rock
has been pushed into it Its kind of closed off
You walk up to the second one Its a little more
up on the left higher range of it and you can
see there are bits of stone and dirt that have
fallen out and created a small pile
on the ground beneath it
 No
 You who have been so distracted by the
reading of the book hear nothing
 Caleb looking at this you figure these
tunnels existed before this burrowing happened
and it looks like when this worm came through
it tore through whatever these tunnels were
and pushed shit into them and wrecked
a little bit of this tunnel structure
 Make a perception check
 Listening in looking up there
you dont see anything the one to the right
you dont see anything
you dont hear anything
 You do notice some markings
quick little cuts in the dirt or stone
like hand or claw marks dragged
across bits of it Small
 You see the pile of rocks and dirt that have
fallen along the top You glance over and you can
see something somewhat shiny thats
picking up the light from your globe
 It looks like a hammer but its not well
taken care of per se Your nose picks up a little
bit of the air here it smells somewhat rancid
a little bit Just a faint hint of rot
 Its about ten feet up The whole
tunnel is one big tenfoot side to side
 No body
 Yeah just like a discarded tool
 Its a hammer It looks like its
seen a lot of use
 The metals wrecked a little bit in places
and its been bludgeoned and misused
 Make an investigation check
 They have been dug and you see
signs that they were dug out by hand
and dug out by shovel or some sort
of a tool used for digging
 From above and the side You get the sense
that the one that opens up here connected to the
other one and this tunnel was burrowed in the
middle and took out that connecting point
 Looking around here most of it
appears to be carved stone and dirt
 Well the tunnel continues also
Its up to you guys
 The Ashkeeper Peaks are what divides the two
sides of eastern and western Wynandir yeah
 Its a couple of feet deep and the rest of
the tunnel goes beyond but for you Caduceus
its a tight squeeze Were talking Bishop in
Aliens getting through the tunnel
 No
 Yeah Theres no breeze in here no
 So you send Frumpkin ahead
 Roll a perception check for Frumpkin In the
dark so disadvantage on the perception check
 Okay good to know
 Whats your idea
 You tie a little ribbon around Frumpkins
neck you cast Light and now the ribbon gives off
this torchlight glow from the back of Frumpkin
 Now roll a straight perception roll
for Frumpkin
  okay Frumpkin continues on  feet 
feet About another hundred feet or so theres
another tunnel intersection its breached by this
carving path Then about another  feet or so
another chamber opens up This chamber is about 
foot by  foot and the smell here is strong
Frumpkin picks up on It smells of rot mildew
feces Its not a pleasant smell and there are
piles of refuse and furs and utensils and belts
and odd objects that are thrown into piles here
You can see a number of other tunnels that all
intersect into this area
 Nope
 Ten or so different tunnels lead
into this chamber all ranging between
two feet wide to about three feet wide
 You see a small broken shovel There are
piles of dirt bones coins Looks like a lot of
things that have been gathered You can see
warped pieces of wood that are partially
whittled and then abandoned in the moment
Stacks of a bunch of junk
 Frumpkin hears a small growl and looks
and in the farright corner theres a small cage
In the cage theres some sort of a furred
creature no more than that big or so
thats missing tufts of fur and its
in the cage going 
 Theyre platforms the topography of the
inside its not just a perfectly oval thing
It has a bunch of pieces of rock and stone
and levels where these tunnels
are emerging and appearing
 Yeah
 Yeah the cat continued down the big
tunnel and found that other chamber The
tunnel continues past that chamber
by the way
 No this was Frumpkin going ahead on
the tunnel you guys were traveling and found
that other chamber and the tunnel continues
on the other side of this chamber
 Yep Frumpkin returns
 Frumpkin heads into the small side tunnel
Curves around about  or so feet and then it
opens up into another small chamber What Frumpkin
sees is a ten by foot opening area with a pile
of matted material like cloth it may have been
at one point but its soiled You see two figures
sitting there One of them is in the process of
fitting something together or pulling something
apart and the other is currently gnawing on some
sort of a longdried bone Theyre tiny humanoid
longer snout tails scaly skin I would say
lizard or almost dragonlike but very tiny
Theyre both sitting in there
spears set to the side 
 About  or so feet
 The last thing Frumpkin sees is
them go 
 Okay You guys all heading to split
to the sides
 You hear a  and you see a
spearhead slowly emerge from the tunnel
and its head poke out ever so slightly
Make stealth checks guys by the way
because this is now going to see you
 Ill say a straight stealth check on
this one this happened too quickly
 Yeah your cloak affects any stealth
check you make for the most part
 Cool
 All right
 Okay It pokes its head out
 Looks right over towards Fjord
and goes 
 
 The one behind it looks through
and is like  and turns around
and runs down the hall and the one
thats there is like 
 All right Well as youre casting
the spell you hear the one that ran back
go like 
 You begin to hear this echoing sound

 Its pretty awesome Gary Gygaxs
ghost says a fun phrase
 Indeed Anyway Getting back into the
insanity you had just grabbed the spear from a
nearby kobold as the other one rushed off I would
like for you to make a strength check please
 No You grab its spear and it goes 
 And pulls it back from you as you hear the
mounting skittering of numerous creatures now
coming from behind where you were and from
the nearby tunnels What are you guys doing
 Multiple directions behind you
 Apparently
 As youre casting the spell
transforming into a larger kobold
you start rushing forward Are you guys
all heading forward with Fjord
 Okay You guys charge forward around the
corner into the next chamber That chamber has
about  or so kobolds that have emerged from or
are in the process of emerging from the different
tunnels that are all facing your direction with
small dinged blades and crossbows that look like
they might work Spears and small leather and
wood shields and they all fill the chamber
in front of you going 
Theyre holding the line What are you doing
 Yeah Theres definitely a confused division
and attention here as theyre like 
 The ones behind Beau as youre strolling
up and hes shouting this out there are about ten
or so kobolds that begin to rush up from behind
and they see you and they slow their step and
start taking their spears and prodding you
to join the rest of the people
 Theres one in the center Of all of them
that are there theres one that is covered in
cages and boxes and leather straps Theres
another that has heavy pieces of armor
almost weighing him down You see others that look
like skirmishers that are all gathered around
and they all have this growling barking energy
They look a bit hungry a bit sallow
and the one thats in the full armor steps forward
towards you and you and is looking
back and forth and gives you this curious look
  You hear him say
in Draconic Come forth loud meal
 There are a number that are
staring at you in half awe like
 Do you approach
 All right make a dexterity saving throw
 As youre saying this with intensity and
force you guys watch as suddenly theres a cloud
of dust around his ankles and a rope loop wraps
and pulls your legs together and hoists you up
and youre now dangling about three
four feet off the ground
 At which point all the kobolds
theres this large wave of cackles
The one raises his hand up and
they all get quiet and he goes
 You Loud food
Points at the rest of you
 You want pass Yep as your hair is just
dripping there and youre slowly 
 Hes following you with this nasty looking
shortsword that looks like the edges of it
are grimed up with black oil or something
 Ugh Takes a step back
Make an intimidation check
 He who summoned kitty spirit
 We already cursed
 You in no position You in that position
So you give one to feed or trade for food
Hes looking at you Hes making this challenge
to you but is definitely keeping a distance
and is taking a step back from where he was
standing so confidently in your direction
 Yes
 Yeah
 Looking at the specifics of Tongues here
 Any creature that knows at least one
language can hear and understand it
so its not so much that youre speaking
Draconic but any creature that knows
language can understand you
So all of you hear this
 Yes
 Actually strangely enough
its speaking in broken Common
 How so What do you want to enhance
 As Frumpkin does that and the rocks shake
and tumble around in this small quaking noise
about six of the nearby kobolds go 
and start skitting away from it
holding their weapons at bay Two of them in
the tunnels all of a sudden go 
and climb up in the tunnels and vanish
 Make a deception check
 You see two of them begin to reach towards
you like 
 The one in the full armor goes
No pay attention and slaps them
with his spear and they 
 Trade
 Sybil Points to one in there and you see
this one kobold thats covered in rags kind of
looks like the collector lady from Labyrinth
and pulls out this large billowing leather sack
thats stained of all sorts of colors around its
basis  It holds it up Its jaw
is slightly dislodged on one side and gives it
this crooked grin to its face Holds it open
 We have water
 Fill food
  The thing all of a sudden slams
into the ground the heavy weight from the
summoned meal hitting the heavy rock floor
As soon as that kobold leans forward
pulled off of his feet and manages to stumble
into it and look inside  Whoa
Begins to shovel it The leader then goes
Stop We eat
 Two may pass More food
for trade rest Huh
 Two and the Fey King can also pass
 You see the others all nervously looking
towards the other and you can see him feeling
really intimidated by your presence Theres this
idea of him being the head of this sect and you
storming in here and hes just this jealous
intensity as it stares towards you and goes
Do not listen Why you come
 False leader may go as well
 What Gator
 What
 You can see four other mouths watering
as youre describing this tough gator skin
 Give us gator skin
 No All of it
  Puts it over the side
pouch of one of the other ones carries it and
 Is that both of them
 One of them steps forward and goes
I think that is Shh Im making number
 It leans forward towards you giving a look
and goes You  goblin
 Make a persuasion check
 Takes the pouch from you 
 Accepted
 Takes and places it in the pouch
 it shouts
You being able to recognize saying
All right let them pass
  Like a sack of potatoes
 From that height Yeah that would
be four points of bludgeoning damage
 Okay Youre keeping watch and a few do get
close and theyre definitely eyeing the various
trinkets that dangle from your belts but as any
of them start getting close you grab and they pull
back The leader goes Go Follow path of big
worm Make big mess Go
 Just looking at you angrily this
 Big mess Move through No longer here
 Days weeks
 Very loud Ruin tunnel
 Very big
 No No go
 Stay here home Eat food from you
 What Points over to the small cage with
the little creature you mean
 Is food
 Its pretty ragged
 From this distance it looks closed
 With a little TLC maybe
 Youre not even sure what kind of
creature it is It kind of resembles
a squirrel kind of resembles a small dog
but its greasy and ratty and
 Most likely yeah
 Make a deception check
 Yes
  You can give Fey King
 Take food keep king
 Okay picks up the Fey King from the scruff
of the neck and goes You I eat Gain power
Bigger than that one False leader
 Let go All of them pull back and begin to
disappear into the tunnels behind and you guys
are given a path through
 The cage is just right there
 Okay the creature immediately jumps out
 and darts off down the tunnel
 You guys continue on the path
 As youre leaving Caduceus you notice
that the leader leans over to two other kobolds
and whispers something to them
 You hear a low muttering but
not in a language you understand
 So what was that
 Okay after you guys leave everyone
scatters into the chambers but stays behind
and watches and two of the kobolds slowly begin
to follow behind the group in the tunnel after you
 One of them is the one thats covered in all
the different boxes and pouches
Theres a staff and it has an actual small cage
like the one that you just opened on its side
with something inside it The other one just
looks to be a small spearholding scout
and theyre both being quiet as they can but
the one carrying everything isnt very quiet
 Caduceus you can hear the gentle
clanging of various accessories of this kobold
trying to be quiet pursuing you down the tunnel
 Well one of them is just covered in
 random shit The other one has a spear
You travel for about an hour or so away from
that the tunnel continuing before you Theyre
still staying back by about  or so feet
 Id say youre probably within
another hour or so of that
 All right So you guys eventually reach that
point and you begin to bed down What do you do
 Okay
 Okay
 Do you guys lay down
What do you do
 Is the dome out or are you waiting
 Yes you are
 Ten feet
 Always been ten feet
 Okay You guys
 As youre invisible are you walking
back towards their direction
 Okay You see the two of them around the
bend are both looking and the one with the spear
is looking kind of eager The one with all the
shit on it is looking a little apprehensive
and theyre both just watching and talking
back and forth 
 Yeah Nott vanished a few minutes ago
 All right
 Okay Go ahead and make a
I would say with advantage
make an athletics check to try and
 Seven The spear vanishes from its hand
  He looks confused
and rubs his wrist and starts walking
back towards the spear on the opposite side
 Okay Go ahead and make an athletics check
 I would say advantage because it doesnt
know youre there Ill allow it Its fine
  Okay If youd like to
describe your kobold

 Move over Taliesin
 There we go
 Welcome Chris
 So Suddenly out of nowhere apparates
in the nervous energy of the moment
the small goblin creature that youve
been eyeing nervously as the group
wandered through and it just reaches out
and grabs a hold of you
 So as you hear this sudden clattering
commotion and both this kobold voice
screaming out Mommy and Nott going Yeah
mommy the other kobold down the way goes
 and runs off to grab
the spear you guys hear this noise
What are you two doing
 Yeah Whats your reaction
and hit him with the scorpion
 Go ahead and make an attack
 So two piercing damage with the crit
 Technically the dice damage is doubled
because its a crit too So its just straight damage
So that will be seven points of poison damage on you
 The eye immediately swells up from
the impact and youre like Ah
Just spinning around in a circle The one
with the spear rushes up like Ergh
Cant quite figure out where to go
What are you guys doing
 You rush around the corner and you see this
whirling whirlwind of clattering pots and cage and
goblin and kobold screaming Anyone doing
anything or are you just watching
 All right
 Gotcha
 All right So its wisdom saving throws
 Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw
if you dont mind
 Okay So
   minus two which is 
 So immediately the one holding the
spear looks at you Huh And you find yourself
all of a sudden stop struggling and weapon
freezes in place At the same time the tiny
goblin arms around you suddenly Hulk out
and you find yourself lifted off the ground
your legs dangling a few inches off
the floor of the cavern
 Im Bex
 Yeah
to make sure you dont drop any food
 Oh 
grubs in your mouth while youre sleeping
 Dont have to tell them this
 Okay Sorry
 
 Theres only one other target
in the chamber
my green slime pot and I will take off my rock
grub pot and Ill lay down my scorpion stick and
my skunk in a cage and my wasp in a bag
 Learning the cuttingedge
kobold technology
 Fjord just comes running down the hallway
 The kobold in right in front of you goes
Ah Just screams at you as you slam into it
The spear goes clattering to the ground
 At which point the Enlarge spell fades

 As he holds up the skunk the nervous energy
around it the skunk just instinctually 
 
 Dexterity saving throw for Jester and Nott
 All right You manage to just barely
escape out of the way as it

 
 Okay
 The other kobold has fled It saw the
running Fjord centipede nightmare and just left
 Still hitting the skunk
  All right so
whats the marching order
 All right
Stingy is actually in the lead
 Got you so youre leading with your
scorpion perfect Spurt continues forward
Do you guys follow
 All right Spurt roll a
perception check for me
  Okay
 Continuing on for the next few hours
getting slowly used to the smell of kobold
especially a movinghoarder of a kobold the
tunnel continues to curve and it goes down a
little further then it evens out and goes down a
little further then evens out You get pretty
late into the day before you begin to notice the
rock and stone having some slight changes
The general bits of materials that youve been
used to seeing down here the heavy gray and
brown rocks occasionally you see flecks and
glimmers that your passing light puts
a shine across You go over and inspect it
and it is a black glasslike substance
 Its obsidian You continue moving forward
and theres more sections of it and you can see
where bits of it are broken and flaked off where
the worm was burrowing through and battered
through a section of obsidian
that then shattered
 Yeah definitely You gather up a bunch
of obsidian shards A lot of it is broken and
brittle but there are some larger bits that you
can find that are pretty jagged really You see
them first so you gather what you want
out of my skunks cage
 There you go
 Hey guys kobolds have ecology down
 Exactly
 Im just saying none of you has a weapon
that feeds you The air gets steadily warmer and
warmer as the hours pass and the floor itself
begins to give way from the softer dirt and dust
with loose pebbles to become a harder more porous
rock and the obsidian begins to become more
apparent and more consistent You Spurt begin to
see a dull light ahead A dull low red light
 It looks to be the tunnel coming to an end
for some sort of chamber Youre too far away to
make out any details but it looks like there is a
room beyond it that has a dull red glow to it
 You just run out
 You guys see Spurt run out The temperature
here is getting warmer and warmer as you progress
Youre starting to find yourselves sweat
uncomfortably You rush out into an open field of
rock like hewn carved rock floor like a
courtyard if you will Its about a hundred feet
or so across at first glance Across the way
there is a wall or portions of a stone wall built
into parts of an obsidian and stone cliff face or
the interior of a cavern You look on the inside
and in this brief instant you take in the
vicinity through your kobold eyes this large
chamber that continues on far to your left To the
right is at a very steep incline an obsidian
wall where a pouring river of molten magma is
coming down into a trough that goes across this
open chamber this river of lava with a bridge
that goes across it to the opposite side To the
left there is a very interesting massive black
iron citadel that sits maybe a quarter mile to
the left of you At the peak of it and this is a
very large chamber dozens of thick heavy black
chains affixed to its peak drape off and connect
to the odd corners of this large cavern This is
far to your left youre in a small side courtyard
on this side As you stop and look around
 hilariously unnoticed by the two massive
fire giants that are currently playing sentinel
Theres one across the way leaning against the
wall standing at roughly  to  feet tall dark
gray skin What little bit of red hair you see
peeking from underneath its armored helmet as
its wearing heavy dark armor covered in spikes
metallic thorns One hand is holding a tower
shield roughly its full height also covered in
spikes in the front with another shield just like
that thats leaning on the wall It looks like
its currently spacing out for a moment looking
back towards the citadel To the immediate left of
you on this side of that molten river you see a
female fire giant wielding a giant maul who is
in the process of picking her teeth with some sort
of pointed bone and neither have noticed you
strangely They rolled really shitty
 You guys arent seeing this
You just see the kobold rush out
 So what do you do Spurt
 The closest one to you is about
 feet to your left
 Okay
 Roll for attack on it or is it a saving
throw on their part
within  feet of me and it bursts open
into a swarm of wasps with  hit points
 Spurt runs out turns and Ah impact
buzzing The giant goes  and slaps
  to hit against you
 You take
 You watch as Spurt turns after throwing
this and then a giant hammer slamming
squishing Gallaghers Spurt across the stone floor
of this open way
 The hammer lifts up and you see the stringy
mess that was once Spurt detaching from the hammer
 Everyone make a stealth check here
 Your work is done here

 Thank you Chris
 Stealth check
 No Pass Without a Trace was not cast
 Oh wow Okay
 As you guys all pull to the sides you hear
 A hand reaches down and rubs it
through the smear that was once the kobold and
rises up A couple of pieces  into the
stonework then the light goes dark as the giants
head bends down and one giant eye peeks
through the tunnel in your direction
 The tunnel is ten feet wide The giant is
going to have a hard time It could probably get
in there if it crawled Right now its leaning
down and looking inside
 It glances around inside bends its
head inside and its completely engulfing
the entire exit
 Backs out of
the tunnel and then steps to the side
You guys just barely fucking made that
 You hear it shout something in Giant
Any of you guys speak Giant
 You do thats right
 Because of his background his race
 Its not a secret Its actually one
of the languages that you get as a
 Sure enough
 There you go What you hear is
 speaking
Giant You recognize it as Be careful Looks
like we got rodents You guys hear on the
opposite side the one that was laying with the
shield sits up for a second and takes the shield
walks over to the river of lava scoops up some of
it and pours it across the top of the shield Its
like a pachinko machine the lava fills the front
of it on the inside theres a pocket and where
once there was just dark iron shield now is
heating up and the shields have a fiery exterior
to them After it fills both the shields it holds
both of them gets back to its position
and theyre both looking around
 You guys who are off to the side
can glance over and watch this happen
Its across the way You have no idea what the other
giants doing but this one is across the way
and is visible from your position
 It looks you would guess probably a
hundred or more feet across to the other side
but there is a wall there
Make a perception check
 Its hard to see from this distance
 Make a perception check for me
to take in the details of the scenery
 No shit Okay not only as you lean forward
and poke through really assess the scene
Ill just pull out the map and show you because
you rolled a natural  Ill be right back
 Heres where you guys are This is the
tunnel Because you rolled a natural  you can
see on the other side a continuation You gather
that when the Kryn traveled through they probably
had to make their way through this chamber and
you gather from the surrounding and the vicinity
the obsidian was probably a difficult thing to
pass through for this worm and probably
why it was forced to briefly make its way
through this courtyard
 Thats an interesting observation
 Yeah thats where Spurt met his end
 Right there
 Then thats the other one
on the opposite side
 No the citadels way that way
 Yeah
 Theres Laser and Target And youre going
 Go ahead and roll a history check for me
 They generally live beneath mountain ranges
and areas of heavy volcanic activity They are
considered the artisan crafters and forgers of
giant kin and the Ordning They have Theyre evil
 No thats just giants
 They can be If it suits them well
They enjoy free labor so they like to
take slaves to force to do the menial tasks
 No Theyre intelligent like
an average being would be
 From what youve heard You dont
have a whole lot of knowledge necessarily
You havent heard of tales of the great
crafty intelligence but nevertheless
they still built this entire underground city
 Theyre both medium sized
 You hear this heavy smacking sound as
the fire giant on your side of this courtyard
is putting to bed the rest of the bees that
have been harrying its kneecap
 Okay you take a moment
and focus on the dodecahedron
 You take your fragment of possibility
 All right
 You guys are over on this side here
 While you guys are working out the
specifics Im going to grab something real fast
Keep talking amongst yourselves
 Yes
 Yes
 Correct
 I love it
 So what order are we doing this guys
 So youre Polymorphing Caduceus into what
 Ill say for the purposes of that
well say this is you
 All right The dragonfly jumps onto Beau
Beau is now in the position to hold
 Okay
 Out of the molten rock Wings 
The manticore begins to rise Both of the giants
look confused towards it and then each other The
one with the shields braces the shields in front
The other one looking off to the side goes and
reaches off to one of the boulders off to the side
and grabs it As it picks it up those at the
front can see the rock seems to heat up There
are veins of heat on the inside as it grips it So
you create the effect This is Major Image right
 Yes All right Theyre both going to look
forward towards it to see what the hell it is
Watching a manticore rise out of magma is insane
 Correct
 Correct The guy with the shields hes
attempting to ascertain with his investigation
as to what the fuck is going on He rolled
a natural  minus one Thats an 
Whats your spell DC
 Yeah The one with the shields goes like
just looks confused as it takes off
The other one
 No I literally rolled two s in a row
 Im sorry
 As the manticore takes off the one holding
the rock is like It twists the rock in the other
hand and reaches over to the side and grabs a
chain and starts ringing this loud bell Its
echoing through the chamber Theyre both
confused as this thing flies off and
they look at each other like
 Yeah theyre looking at each other
Whats up next
 I cant believe I rolled It was such
a great idea I just rolled really high
 Whos doing what
 You dont know
 You would imagine it has larger reach
than an average creature being a giant
 On the giant Okay
Whats the save on that
  wisdom
 You got it For that one five
  All right I dont have a
cow mini on me at the moment
 I know How fucking dare I
Ill use this horse
 So the fire giant suddenly  
 The one over here goes and looks
confused at that
Everyone needs to roll initiative on this
because youre entered official combat
 All righty  to 
 Damn Beau
 All right  to 
  to ten
 No one  to ten
 All right So Yashas at nine
 Caleb at three
 All right Beau youre up first
 All right 
 As a bonus action 
 Oh right Its actually ten more
and you still have your action
 Beau goes  and is already on the
opposite side The giant with the shields goes
 and goes to go for a shove and
watches her vanish and goes 
and looks back at the tunnel on the other side
She completely just skids off no effect
 Okay so you go 
and Caduceus suddenly apparates
next to you almost collapsing you from
the weight of his much larger body
 You got it all right That finishes
your go Jester youre up
 All right  On the other
side of the tunnel
 All right that finishes Jesters go
Fjord youre up
 There we go Got me a horse
 Nugget comes out Blink dogs have
a movement of  so thats 
 Hes going to do action to run as well
 and then is going to use his
teleport ability which he gets to teleport
 feet Gets right there 
That finishes your go Fjord
what are you doing
 All right
 You got it All righty
That ends your turn
 Caduceus youre up
  You get there to cast it
 All right Whats the DC on that
 Constitution  They got a lot of
constitution these fire giants
 Sorry
 You do
 Isnt that once per long rest though
 You did I believe Thats right
All righty
 The beetles scatter and go
 It has been yeah I was thinking of the
kobolds but no It was earlier before that
 Go for it
 Theyre attacking the shield and its
burning up the beetles because its a flaming shield
 Right They couldnt quite get there
Theres so much shield for it to get to

 You popped out and this is
the wall here This is a tunnel
 For better appearance here
There thats the tunnel All righty
That finishes Caduceus turn
It is now the fire giants turn
 Seeing Fjord there 
 Hes going to go ahead he doesnt know
if hes going to have enough range for it
Hes going to attempt his shield charge
 No actually Its going to instead
cruise up  up to that point and
its going to grab a rock off the ground
and chuck it straight at you Fjord
 Like a rock Its about
the size of your torso
 It reaches off the side and its been
sitting next to the lava and its actually
orange on one side from the nearby heat
Picks it up drops the shield
for a second picks it up and 
lobs it right towards you
 Oh thats going to be  to hit
 Yeah
 You cant tell where Fjord ends
and Spurt begins
 Oh fuck All right that is 
points of bludgeoning damage
 I need you to make a concentration check
 Because you are currently
holding your spell
 No not Polymorph Hes holding like
when you begin casting your Thunder Step
 Its a constitution saving throw and you
have to have half of  that puts it at 
The DC of  you have to beat
to maintain concentration
 The boulder slams into you and for a
minute your lights just go white
Your eyes go to complete and utter absence
of image just the color white The pain
streaks through you You can feel the burning
scrape of when it impacted your forehead
and as soon as you right yourself you look
down and the spell begins to fade from your
fingertips and you just barely hold on to it
Its like rocketing in your hands
You can see the energy and the thunderous
power beginning to build in your palm
That finishes that giants turn
The cows going to move
 Oh god All right I dont have
movement for a cow here
 Yeah dude they can move
 Hold on Cow There it is

Large beast  feet
 The cows going to go ahead
and attempt to attack you
  to hit Whats your armor class
 You take eight points of piercing
damage as the cow gores you with its horn
I need you to make another constitution
saving throw
 Correct Its DC ten
 Oh my god Damn it
 Yashas turn
 She just barely makes it around with
her  feet of movement to get to you
the cow now blocking that space that she
was going to run through
 No she hasnt left the cows melee range
 Yasha runs up to you and
 Yeah you guys appear already
in the tunnel across the way
 It does
 Is there a save
  fail Takes  damage
 
 The cow form is sundered as the
thunder blast destroys its Polymorph form
second fire giant pissed off real angry
But that does carry over seven points
of thunder damage to the fire giant
 All right that finishes Yashas turn
Nott youre up
 So youve already cast Invisibility
on yourself
 There you go
 Your speed is now  because
you took the halfling feat
 So if youre moving at full speed
the stealth rules looking this up right here
As youre invisible Impossible to see 
The creatures location can be detected by
any noise it makes tracks it leaves
So still means stealth check but you have
advantage on the stealth check I believe
if youre moving your full speed
its disadvantage on stealth
Im trying to remember
 If you have disadvantage and advantage
it just cancels out no matter how much you
have of each So it would be just a straight
roll Ill put it there Thats fine
So go ahead and make a stealth check
 It all cancels out So  thats
your movement As you come through quietly
the giant who just appeared goes and looks over
Passive perceptions are  and  Both giants
look and they see footsteps and theyre both
like  They still dont know they know
the general vicinity where you are Anything
against you still has disadvantage
but its still your turn You still have
your bonus action and your attack
 Yeah
 This way
 All right So five ten As soon as the
footsteps are happening it makes an attack
of opportunity in your general direction
It has disadvantage on the attack
 So for this here this is with
its giant maul That is a  to hit
 Okay So its a giant hammer thats
large enough that sweeps through the
general area and catches you in the back
You take
  points of bludgeoning damage
 Okay so you use your reaction so
that makes it a  Go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw DC ten to try and
maintain concentration on Invisibility
 No
 Constitution saving throw
 You just barely maintain concentration
That was the base DC
    You still have ten more
feet of movement there
 Okay
 Youre under the bridge now
 Go for it Go ahead and make a
stealth check This is with advantage
 Yes
  Okay
 They both saw where you went but they
dont know exactly where you are
That finishes your turn Caleb youre up
if you want to do anything
 Okay Whats the save on that
 Gotcha Natural  plus five Im rolling
really fucking good for these guys
 That is ridiculous
 They are Thats a plus five
 There you go
 There
 There
 All right Okay Is that your turn
 You got it That finishes your go to the
top Beau anything Are you staying put
 To what To
 Okay you got it
Thats your action
 Jester your turn
You doing anything
 Youre back in the tunnels so you
have to move out to really get a good view
 All right
 Fjord youre on deck
 Okay Where are you placing your
 Right there
 As it is an illusory duplicate
it does not need to make a check
It just appears to leap and land
 Okay I will say make
a deception check
 Okay
 That finishes your turn Jester
 Fjord youre up
 All righty Caduceus
 Nope
 You would have to get a lot closer
than you are yes
 You are actually further than
 feet from Nott
 Not too bad You can move  feet
and get pretty close
 You could do that yes
 Yeah You walk out and go
And dont see Nott
 All right do you move back in
 What spell
 You got it Okay now its their turn
The dreadnaught is going to step off there
and use its shield charge against the bridge
Stepping forward and slamming
into the stone there
 It is And theres a lot of people
really confused out by that citadel
 Ooh
 The whole bridge comes crashing down
 Into the lava there This bridge part
collapses Nott I need you to make
a dexterity check Or saving throw please
  You avoid some of the damage
You manage to just skitter out of the way
So you take half That puts you at it would be
 down to  points of bludgeoning damage

 Yashas staying put
Nott your turn
 Okay You can do it You can
You run across 
 Its up to you Are you going to
try and leap across
 Yes there is one chunk here that is
splashing and hasnt sunken in yet
 All right Go ahead and make an
athletics check well say just to try and
 Yep
 Thats fine Thats the base you needed
 Making it across this way As you rush
across though the movement catches its
attention It gets an attack of opportunity
on you However its at disadvantage on
the attack So that would be  to hit
 As soon as you rush up and leap in the air
it sees the push off of rocks and backhands with
the hammer and as it swings out you pull your
legs up and it just barely  misses from
beneath your feet as you tuck them closer to
your chest and land on that rock piece there
So thats  You can attempt
one more jump
 Athletics check
 Nine  So the good
news is you dont  into it
because lava doesnt really work that way
However its a lot of fire damage
Yeah Im trying to remember
where that is
 Yeah it is
 Thats right
 Okay pardon me here
 Its not in that book
 Yeah its all good
Thank you Google
 Its pretty bad Its pretty bad
 On page  of the
Dungeon Masters Guide
 Bless you
 All right Your foot hits the edge
and just skips You fall back and land
and hit the lava on your back and legs
The ring keeps you from sinking into it
so Im not giving you full submerged
damage so you dont take the full d

 It is
  points of fire damage
 Its not an attack
 You cant really dodge the fire
 A Cure Wounds which has to be
up next to him
 You said Cure Wounds earlier
 Ill allow it all right I need you to make
a constitution saving throw please
 Oh youre unconscious Oh okay
 The second Nott falls you see a burst of
fire and Notts unconscious body is currently in flames
 All right so go ahead and roll that
 Thats right because
you are a grave cleric
 Youre also on fire
 Okay on the big one
 What are you polymorphing them into
 Okay So that is a what
  wisdom That is a  The large
giant suddenly turns into a large octopus
 I will say for the purposes of not
having a giant octopus thing
we will just use that for now
 Its aquatic in nature It suddenly wet
impacts and is now trying to pull itself forward
on its new cephalopod body
So thats your action Caleb
 Okay that ends your turn
Beau youre up
 So as soon as that happened you would be
  So you move up with your action
You havent grabbed yet That was
your holding your dash
 So you reached down and the flames
are burning your hand The heat is causing
the skin on your face and arms to begin
to bubble from just the sheer intensity
of it As you reach down and pull Notts
flaming body up from the lava Nott your
eyes come open at that moment and you realize
youre on fire but Beau is holding you
 Youre going to go ahead and
 Well you still have a movement and
your bonus so it was just your action to
pick up its halfspeed to drag somebody
with you so you move  feet 
and then you can move 
 to get Nott into the tunnel
 Okay That would be your next turn
because that was all your actions left
 Jester your turn You see Beau suddenly
rush in and drop to the ground and Nott is on fire
 Nott currently is the only one on fire
but you do take five points of fire damage
just from the proximity of reaching out
and grabbing Notts body
 Go for it Roll for an attack
 That hits Go ahead and roll damage
  points of necrotic damage As your
duplicate rushes forward and reaches out and
grabs the knee right in front of the storming
fire giant You watch as the surge of divine
energy goes from a blue to a green to a black
and as it pierces the knee cap and shoots up
the leg the giant just howls in extreme pain and
while it was currently focused and reaching down
for another boulder while watching Beau carry
Nott away it suddenly drops the rock
grabs its hammer and looks down
at your duplicate furious
 All right that finishes your turn Jester
Is that your turn
 All right Fjord Anything
 Nothing All right Caduceus
 Okay you use your action to put the
fire out on Nott
 Youre just watching You got this
 You got it That brings us to their turn
This one is going to
 No just up there and then dashes
 Its still not in range but its
curling over the ruins of the bridge
Your blink dog gets into your space there
Now at the end of Polymorph
it doesnt get a saving throw right
I dont believe
 Yeah thats what I thought it was
Okay All righty
 Right its just concentration Thats
right Cool The other fire giant is going to
it does not discern that this is an illusion and
just spends its turn with two giant hammer
swings towards your illusory Jester just through
it with no effect Angrily swings again
No effect Definitely knows its an illusion now
but wasted its entire turn doing that That
being the case its going to go ahead and move
  The thing sinks into the lava
and its feet  into it Doesnt
matter It is now starting to step out of the
lava Has one leg up and its hammer ready
and its just steaming towards like you
like an angry freight train That ends their
turn Moving forward Yashas up Anything
 All right Notts turn
 No Fjord has put the fire out
  misses or it hits but it hits the plate
armor in its chest and just ricochets off
  Actually it hits the armor and
gets stuck but it didnt pierce enough
to actually hurt the giant
 All right that finishes your go Caleb
your turn
 The entire door wall closes off
with five feet of stone
 As soon as that happens youre like
Awesome All right lets go and you hear
 from the back The stone is already

 All right You guys go running and running
You hear the impacts from behind get more and more
distant as you feel like youve managed to safely
make your way beyond this strange encounter from
the outskirts of this unknown fire giant citadel
And thats when well finish tonights episode
