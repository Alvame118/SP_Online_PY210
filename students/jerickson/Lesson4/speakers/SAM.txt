 Spasm shaming
 Use it
 Oh what Little sister What
 Hi
 Now
 Why
 Get some booze got some books find a little
taste of civilization maybe some better food
 Oh yes very good I know everyone else
makes fun of your smell but I dont smell
nothing
 Under sort of holding arrest or something We
cant leave the city
 But I was thinking about this The people we
lunatics but they draw a lot of attention to
themselves leaving us free to sort of slink back
into the shadows a little bit It might be sort of
the perfect camouflage No ones going to be
looking for a little goblin girl anymore because
theyll be looking at the crazy people the
tieflings running around smashing shit
 Well lets give it a day and if things seem
a little bit you know skinkydoodie tomorrow we
can fritter away in the middle of the day or
something
 But we need to replenish the healing potion
you used If we dont have that then what happens
the next you get in trouble
 All right but how on earth are we all
right We can cool it with the cons for a couple
of days But I cant promise that I wont get the
itch again
 All right
 No I didnt do nothing we just went to a
show
 It was a pretty good show Up until you
know the dead people part
 Yeah Well well lay low Should we pretend
that were still friends with these people
 Dont worry Ill turn on the charm
 Thank gods
 Oh thank God youre here and safe We missed
you Somehow we got separated Friends
 Im lying

 Two please
 Hi Frumpy nice to see you again
 Were just a couple of friends strolling
around the countryside looking for adventure
 We have a string of bad luck We tend to get
in trouble in places for various reasons Some of
which is my fault Most of which is my fault I
have sticky fingers I cant help myself
sometimes Im fascinated by little bobbles and
fancy pieces of jewelries and I love trinkets so
much I just have to take them and have them
with me and put them in my pockets Its gotten
us in a few scrapes a couple times Caleb he is
fantastic Very patient with me understands But
really its my fault its not him Hes a smart
man a brilliant magician Have you seen Some of
his tricks are phenomenal really
 I feel bad to because we never stay in one
place long enough for him to have a decent shower

 Anyway thats the long and short of it
 Well the nice ones I keep I have a little
 I collect a lot of things but in the last
place we hunkered down it was all taken from me
We were in one of those prisons before Am I
sharing too much Im sharing too much arent I
We were in a prison they took all of our
belongings I lost all of my collections I had a
lovely rock collection I had a rare coin
collection I had a stick collection Yeah its
all gone now
 I love them I just dont have any right
now
 True But they were like peoples canes and
things

 I mean I call them sticks because I dont
need them But I suppose they really needed them
 You know those rocks that humans wear on
their fingers and around their necks and stuff
Theyre really nice rocks
 Oh I dont care about the people who have
them I just like pretty things Toys anything
really
 Okay Can you help with that
 No its the collecting
 Well would you like a demonstration
 Sure Thatll make it really easy Are they
closed
 All right Out of practice here Im going to
do a shot Crack my knuckles
 Hell be pissed What
 He
 Whats on your waist
 Oh All right Ill go to her left buttcheek
pocket and fish around
 What pockets do you have
 Ill do the hip pocket
 Three

 Plus eight
 This is not how it usually works The person
is not really expecting it This is embarrassing
really I have the one skill and I failed at it
 Yes I know the trick Takes a little bit of
time doesnt it
 Okay  I do know one piece of
magic Feast your eyes
 Fibulous It will turn into a silver piece
 Only I can say it

 For everyone has their own magic word and it
wont work with you

By the ancient order of the school fibulous
 No it only works up
 Well no we werent giving you the silver
piece just showing you a bit of magic This pot is
actually quite powerful It can do that once a
day so if youd like to purchase it
 Well it only works once a day
 I think it only does the copper to silver
 Yes its a mild magic pot But if youd like
to purchase it from us we can sell it to you for
five gold
 At discount for friends three gold
 And for that well teach you your own magic
word
 You can do it once a day forever you have it
for the rest of your life
 But this is free money that you dont have
to work for
 All right one gold
 Its a pleasure doing business with you Does
that answer your question Ive got some for you
 Yeah How does someone like you  youre
human right
 How do you come by learning Halfling
 Everyone likes wine
 What town was that then
 Hmm havent heard of it
 Nothing shady there
 Absolutely
 I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo
pose
 I feel it coming Hit me
 
 Thank you
 Where did you come from then
 Its past midnight
 Natural 
 Is that good
 What Who What Whats going on
 Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave
the tavern We received no formal instruction
 Howd you get in
 The fork trick wasnt very fun was it
 The monster attack

Beyond
 Whoa nothing changed No spells I lost ten
hit points What the fuck Ive done something
terribly wrong

 Well work on this during the break
 Shes a morning person too Jesus
 Get some breakfast I guess
 
  Sure for you
 We werent told that
 But I can change my appearance
 Yeah
 What does that mean
 What are we doing again
 So we solve the case to clear our own name
 If we solve the case we would be absolved
Its not a terrible plan
 Listen weve all had a rough night I know
that my features arent necessarily the most
feminine Among goblin kind I understand Its
hard to tell
 You really have to sell it though and act
like a dude
 Oh yes
 Angelina
 Excellent
 Well its just that listen theres no
offense I enjoy our talks and your schooling and
everything but I havent talked this openly and
freely with other people in months Its amazing
 Yes
 Were the first ones out the door
 Yeah Theyll never know who we were
 Well dont say that too much I mean yes
they do know that were Caleb and Nott yes
 Okay
 Yeah lets just go with and see where it
leads
 Hi Yes we werent talking
 Oh What are you Im sorry Im just a young
girl from the village
 I dont know anything I should go get my
father
 But you look like

street
 Those lips are very big
 What is that What does that do

have shit smeared all over you You could travel
with me I could be your daughter
 Yes Were a couple and hes our guard or
something I dont know
 Im sorry shes very forward
 Yes mommy
 There were the snakes in the circus last
night but it wasnt related to the attack I

 We are really terrible at this
 Continue the investigation Or go back

 Can you give me something to look for To
distract me and give me a mission to go on

 Wait More No thats right 
 Shit Okay Its a baby bottle or maybe a
rattle Whatd you say

way I could lend you some if youd like
 Lets do it
 I guess we do
 Well That was terrible No one found out
anything It was a waste of a day Were all
terrible at this Goodnight
 That is nonsense
 Hey Dungeon Master
 The other night when Nott was out carousing
a bit while Caleb was asleep He saw some figures
in cloaks dash by Was there any distinctive
anything about these three figures that
dashed by
 Damn it Okay I will share that information
with the group I saw some weirdos running
around
 The other night when he was asleep
 Two in the morning
 Sorry
 I had gone out to do some window shopping
 Yes I wasnt very successful I had walked
by the general store
 I passed by a place called Natural Remedies
herbs and medicinal things I went by a spot named
Jackalwere its a smithy
 It was between I dont remember
 I think that was what it was called
 We could do a little stakeout
 Probably by foot or by horse right
 Yeah
 Yeah he has a magical spell that alerts you
when someone tries to break in your room
 Best part is it doesnt alert him when I
sneak in or out
 Wait What
 Ooh
 See hes really good
 Yeah Ill go to where I saw the three
cloaked figures
 Stealth check Do I still have the blessing
No I dont
 
 
 Should we fan out a bit Cover a couple
corners so we can still see each other

Dwarvish
 Maybe she speaks Common Well be fine Shes
a circus person
 Lets wake her up
 Toya Singing dwarf

 Sorry to disturb your slumber
 Do you recognize us from the other night
Last night
 Last night
 Has it happened before or was that

it different
 When you were singing did you hear any other
sounds or words that someone else was saying
 Has anyone new come around and talked to

 Asked you to do anything Its so strange
 No were really good
 And yesterday before the show you didnt
notice anything weird anyone creeping around the
carnival setting up anything

 Were cracking this case wide open
 Are we in the same tent or are we in two
different tents
 Bastard
 Can I just say Laura and I busted the case
wide open

 We solved the case Easy
 Couple inquisitions Couple little uh
Following the clues
 No problem with our setup
 Were fighting already
 Nope
I rolled her dice it was a one Im never
rolling it again
 Is that German
 Five
 I have five One plus four
 You guys are out in the open
 The horses have better initiative
than all of us
 Cool map
 Its still alive
 Nott is going to hard charge out of the tent
Not at the beast but across the courtyard Yes
she make it to that box
 She cant
 As shes running shes going to fire her
crossbow at the dude  plus six 
 Okay so that is seven points of damage and
sneak attack damage
 Another two points
 Oh And why not Ill use Fury of the Small
Add another two points
 Yes and then bonus action can I just hide
behind that thing
 Apparently
 Travis is using magic
 Man down
 Seeing one of us die scares the shit out of
me
 No dead forever

 I start charging out at the beast
 I get about halfway I fire my crossbow

Fire the crossbow
 Thats a natural 

 Im low to the ground so probably in the back
of the calf or something Before it falls Im
going to turn and run into the tent I dont even
know if I hit 
 Its a cantrip
 Its designed for this moment
 Oh no shes not proficient
 Use my dice that I gave you
 Yes
 Thats what Im hoping for
 Thats a strong four
 Is there any young girl in the tent with me
 Natural 
 That means I have to go
 The smell of sulfur I mean brimstone do I
figure that its probably the residual from the
big toad guy or is there a substance in the room
that is causing it
 A religion check One

 Im going to try and get out of the tent
through the side Like underneath the side and
towards the horse Yeah back there Looking for
Caleb
 No not yet Is he okay Did he live Did
everyone live
 Oh yes I do hi Yeah so he cant be far
 Okay Theres horses around here lets steal
them
 Might I point out real quick up to this
point we are fugitives who havent committed a
crime But starting now we will be fugitives who
have committed crimes Are we sure we want to do this
 All right lets go But I have to find Caleb
first
 Should I shoot them
 The white one
 Toyas gone right
 Sorry that we thought that you did it
Briefly
 Saddle up
 Where are we going
 Were going with them then
 Wait what
 How did we never know that
 How many suns are there
 Just change the license plate No
 Back in time

 Its really shallow Shouldnt we weigh them
down with something
 We could write a little note and put it in
one of their pockets that says something like
Ive discovered that Caleb and Nott are innocent
and should be cleared of all charges or
something like that
 Sure How do you spell Jester
 Okay
 We were going to go along the north way
right
 The toad went due north Like straight into
the water
 Could be
 If were chasing the toad it seems like we
need to find a boat and go out into the water
 Steal that boat
 Well no we are just going to find the toad
You said this Were camping and waiting and
resting
 Or swim
 You can hit dice it
 Do any of us know whats beyond Like whats
on the other side of this lake Is it a mountain
 Do you just need ten gold pieces
 Were going to go shopping at three in the
morning

 Ooh he has it written down On a thing
 So Fjord youre very acquainted with seamen

 Are there clusters of seamen around you at
all times
 And I saunter away I mosy away

 They have a vulnerability to poppyseed
muffins
 Jerking off

 Roll for spanking
 But they still said we couldnt leave
 Does Molly always smell of patchouli
 What else do you need
 I jumped on to the octopus and it served as
some sort of a landing pad It killed the octopus
but I lived
 Ive tried
 I was very hungry
 Buy some what incense
 Ive been to one of these places its called
Natural Remedies Herbs and medicinal things Its
up the street a bit
 Maybe
 Or I could sneak in and grab it for you

 No the coin was magic It was a magic pot

 When we were investigating we were
 Bad Cop
 I was the bad cop
 Youre not leaving here without telling us
the truth
 Im crazy Ill bite her too
 Yeah it was crazy
 She confessed to being a little girl
 Do they cut themselves like you
 We meted out the truth
 We cracked the case wide open
 Toya Unless and heres my new theory
 the
big frog man can leech the life force from people
 What if Toya is a fullygrown adult woman
but hes been slowly leeching so much life from
her that shes a small husk
 Shes a tiny fullgrown person
 Oh shes just a dwarf Oh okay that makes
more sense actually when you say it that way It
seemed like she was shrunken down from magic
 One of his tentacles
 Not just tentacles dwarf tentacles
 Lets go I think we know all we need to know
 That tracks That fully tracks
 Lets go
 Gesundheit On the way out can I grab some
booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask
Or to fill it up a little
 Great Ill mark it down
 As am I
 Ill keep lookout
 Oh yes here it is Come on charis
 Were fine we went out the front door

 Well go with right
 Were just going out in the open to the
water
 Im guiding him along
 Nope

 Boink
 You monster

super scared to be on the water
 Nighttime beach party
 That is true
 All you need to know is theres three dudes
and three ladies You do the math
 That seemed to work
 Heavens to Murgatroyd
 I did a Travis burp
 I blew it that way
 Guide you through
 The exact order that our minis are right
there
 Well not the exact order
 Were fine like this
 Were all going to die anyway
 
 The whales are in my power
 Did Toya love crabs
 What
 I didnt burp
 That was you
 I have not burped
 Theres a full hut with a witch inside
Matt

 Theres a full twostory hut with a burning
fireplace
 Everybody or just her
 Look at this wellconstructed map
 They Its just one
 Toyas just a dwarf girl
 
 Wait you cant see because youre looking
through the sparrow or because youre a human
 Thats why were holding hands
 Irish Laura
 Three Not three
 
 Still 
 Use your DD Next to look at the information
about that spell
 Wait did you have two minis made for
yourself
 Ah wow
 Crush that windpipe
 Okay Seeing where Caleb has run If I move
will that imp next to me get an attack
 Okay Well then I will turn to the imp next
to me and I will slash at it with my shortsword
 Two
 Two plus six Eight
 All right I will bonus action disengage and
run to Caleb
 They cant get us over here

 Every time he casts a spell does it go


 Oh boy
 No
 Thats nothing Youre fine
 We each have like  hit points
 Juggernaut
 Hes so wise
 
 Gore
 Its a roll off
 Its because she is really a tentacle She is
part of him
 I mean I can seeing Caleb surrounded Nott
will leap on to the beasts face and stab it in
the neck
 The big one
 Ill disengage first
MATT Okay so you disengage as a bonus action
Move over
 
 Nine ten plus fury of the small 
 No problem
 And you lose all your gold
 Are you a bard What the fuck
 
 Ten
 
 Eight points
 Why do I get sneak attack
 All right  points
 There is an imp still in front of us
 Okay I will just shoot him with an arrow
Im like ten feet away
  feet Ill draw and shoot
 Oh boy ten
 And then I will
 I really do I will cover Calebs body with
mine
 Well see
 
 From an imp
 Its pronounced verd
 Okay with one hand I will try to cover the
bleeding wounds of Caleb and with the other hand
not even looking Ill just fire my crossbow at
the other

 At the other impy thing
 One
 I shouldve looked
 Thats a six
 Im blinded by tears

 I mean I cant do anything I can run over
to the other thing but I cant do anything so
 And my boy
 I dont know that but Im just staying
 I will try to stabilise Caleb using no
 Natural  And I will do mouthtomouth
 Ugh thats what she looked like

 So its just gooey flesh
 Those are very nice
 They are very pretty yes Where did you find
them
 On the bag Can I have one
 What if shes evil
 Authorities
 Im going to try to take one off
 Eight 
 Im just going to say I did it

 What does that mean
 Oh are you alive right now
 How about just the head
 I got one too
 Poor girl
 Should we kill him
 We gave him one bottle of wine Thats not
very much
 This is a small town Beau Everyone talks to
everyone You taught us that
 I was never here We never had this
conversation
 Im very ugly for a halfling
 Why do we need to take it with us Us
traipsing through town with a giant head seems
like it would draw focus Why dont we just put it
somewhere and send the authorities out here to
find it later
 What are they going to do with it Its a big
head
 We can hide it Maybe some of us have skills
to hide things
 Just to game this out You Caleb someone
who is not suspected of a crime is going to bring
the severed head of a member of the circus to the
police
 Either way You Caleb someone who is not
suspected of a crime is going to point the police
to the severed head of a member of the circus with
no evidence showing what that thing was or that it
was evil and that will somehow not implicate
other people who were not with us at the time How
is this going to prove their innocence just
showing a head
 Its good
 And Ill never do it again

  Well come to your house with your
share of the reward

 Youre strong though
 Ill help you
 Ill help you
 Thats all right Im strong One two
three
 Im not coming with you
 What if youre in trouble Youre very hurt
Youve had a terrible night
 Unless youre dead No ones going to be
around to save you if you get into trouble
 Yeah thats not good
 Her hands are very warm
 Oh god
 Thats true But I didnt have my fingers in
the holes
 Its nighttime the moonlight makes
everything sort of look purple
 
 Did you say a shoe
 A shoe
 My shoe
 We took a short rest on the thing
 If you want to hit dice it up
 We have to kill these fucking guards dont
we
 She calls it a shoe its a shoe ring
 Do I have to go too
 But I was just a bystander I was walking
down here and I saw these two ruffians and
I was going to go get help
 Zero

 Three minus three is zero
 Racism
 They keep regular hours here
 Kill them all
 Were not criminals Were not Me and Caleb
were just travelling ever since we broke out of that
Nothing
 Whats going on over there
 Who is going to go get the little girl
 Weirdly hes dripping wet
 A little halfling girl
  I mean
 Im sorry Im really nervous
 Im very nervous Im sorry its just your
guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and I
cant move to get into a good position
 Look I have some evidence to submit Look at
my hands and also the hands of Jester Were
covered in the things blood We were there too
We helped the killing of the creature
 Im sorry for your loss Where are your
people from
 Thats not where my clans from I had
nothing to do with it My clan operates far far
away and
 Im looking on the map Near the Felderwin
Tillage
 You can Feel free Ill even tell you where
they are Im no longer associated with them and I
can help you hunt them down if youd like
 One
 Its not a natural one
 This is even more awkward Just put me back
down Put me back down
 No The chains are pulling me one way and
youre pulling me the other way Just come down to
my level Come down here
 Oh Thank you I would kiss you if I could
 Where did you go Were you on the lam for a
long time
 He was an evil fiend When he joined the
circus who brought him in
 No he was literally an evil fiend
 He controlled the girl
 Also Beau crushed her windpipe
 I never heard of that game
 Yeah yeah
 The tickets are probably worth something
 Out of the tent
 Those arent invented
 No
 I think Jester
 Jester I think its safe to say that this
first case is closed
 So we could open some sort of private
investigation service
 Out of a tent
 Aw they took the tent
 You got to jump on the tent when it becomes
available
 Well do we have to leave I mean Im not
wanted anymore
  Thats progressive

 Were here

 Oh no
 Um is she coming
 A little bit Youre very big
 Oh No theres no comma
 Im just Nott the Brave

 You have to roll dont you
 Well it was mainly Caleb We had to get out
I mean it was a bad place
 We would have died for sure
 Thats true for sure
 But they treated us very badly and we needed
to get out of there
 Any place is I mean weve been travelling
around a bit but
 Im told east is bad too Theres monsters
 Oh no not south

 It was on top of a head Ugh thats really
gross
 I like you just the way you are
 Well I suppose we should all go to sleep and
then if any of us are here in the morning well
set off together
 Yorda
 That sounds lovely and I would like to browse
there again but honestly Caleb I am very
worried about you You have passed out twice in
the last few days and unless we get you a healing
potion there is no promise that you will still be
alive tomorrow I think we should go to Natural
Remedies You distract the owner while I go in the
back and I steal a healing potion Its the only
way to guarantee your safety
 Yes
  Bacons really good
 Im looking around for something to swipe
 Ten
 Anything small Ooh Can I find my old flask
that I left here
 Im going to steal back my old flask
 
 Mmhmm
 I rolled a 
 Im excited
 Yes Vater

 They got a violinist over there Im sorry
zey got a violinist over zere Vater
 Ive heard of them
 While you bathe
 Youll still be the same Caleb when youre
done right
 Ive just gotten used to you and now youre going
to change a bit
 All right
 No problem Ill just be over here you know
bathing
 Im going to find the pitcher of cucumber
water dump it on the floor and eat all the cucumbers

 Look around for anything in the room that can
be stolen
 Ill start working on that
 After a while I put a toe into the water
flask and fill it up with water
 Then work on the doorknob
 
 Oh 
 Is it a big vase
 Sure Ill try to get that too
 Ill also save the flowers in a separate
pouch
 Any towels Ooh you know what
 Im going to take one towel and tear it into
shreds and use it to replace any of my bandages
that have worn or fallen off
 Im good
 Health pack
 Youre just moving things
 Thats beautiful Who made this Did you make
this
 You got to get a camera on this shit

 It was a onceinalifetime experience
 Consider it paid You look the same Does he

 I wanted to go to Herbal Remedies and see if
we could get you a healing potion
 Auf Wiedersehen
 DD Beyond everybody Our sponsor for the
evening
 Cut to an hour later and someones jamming
an adrenaline needle
 All of you
 North we go
 We could rob the store
 I mean we could use one of our preplanned
strategies
 We could just do the simplest
 the Prince and
the Pauper
 All right
 Youre right we should leave town with our
wits about us and full of health Lets just go
while were ahead Besides I got plenty of stuff
today
 Yeah lets go
 Lets skip that one please
 They roam about
 Jesus Were on foot
 A cart
 This is a good trick he does He can look at
it once and it will stay with him forever
 Yes its amazing you can quiz him on it later
While hes memorizing it Yasha is that your name again
 I got you these flowers
 Thought that they might gussy you up a bit
Its a lot of drab colors Also maybe you wont
kill me now
 I know I gave you the flowers
 Girls like flowers
 I didnt because youre less of a threat
 Sure
 All girls like flowers
 You see

 It doesnt hurt to be nice sometimes
 Well it hurts you
 Are we going to walk there Should we get
horses
 Well find out I suppose
 Why Whatre you doing
 By the authorities
 Youre so mysterious
 Name one
 Please Beau let the detectives figure this
out Is it Desmond
 Its Ornna isnt it Its Ornna I knew it
 Yes of course See Another case cracked It
was Ornna
 Oh If we live
 Mail fraud on the way out of town
 Fjord something in me says that for some
reason you should be the one who tells the horses
and wagon to go

 It just seems youre the biggest maybe
 I could take a crack at it The wagons be
hitched heehaw
 Saddle up your doggies heehaw
 Yeehaw
 With advantage Six Im still a scary
goblin
 Ashley Johnson ladies and gentlemen

 Oh
 That tiefling anatomy is very strange you
know
 Which is Frumpkin now
 Hes gone to the other place He wont be
able to respond
 A unicorn would be really cool
 We can rob them
 Well we could rob them or we could go off
the road and hide and wait for them to pass
 Oh we dont
 Pleasant day
 He cant hear you
 He cant hear you
 He wont be able to talk to you for a while
You see hes not really there
 Nine
 Do they look sad
 I mean we have in the past If we are
confident we can get away with it we would We could
 Theres a lot of people in that caravan
though it seems like a risky maneuver
 We could probably get away with it Why You
want to follow them and rob their shit
 I mean sure Lets go do it
 Oh okay
 No we were more smalltime thieves We
wouldnt typically hijack moving caravans Usually
wed wait until they parked somewhere and then
just go sneak on and steal something out of the back
 But if you need me to teach you how to steal
you can tag along sometime
 All right
 Yes please
 Should leave a guard with the
 And believe
 Sounds good
 Maybe you shouldnt go
 Oh thats very nice of you
 We do Thats very nice of you thank you
What did I do to deserve this
 Ill sit up with you Jester and take first
watch B
 No its pretty good
 It was violin class What
 Whats going on
 Why did we leave you on watch You cant see
in the dark
 Okay let me sneak around and look Right We
dont want to wake everyone because
 What if its nothing Then theyll be upset
with us Theres nothing more dangerous than
 No shes the most irritable
 Sorry
 Im going to go look I can see in the dark
 Im going to dart off in a flanking maneuver
  plus stuff
 
 Buffalotype creatures or buffalo
 How far am I from the camp
 Cool Im going to pull out a piece of copper
wire and remembering the motions that Caleb
taught me Im going to twirl it around in my hand
and hold it up to my mouth and whisper a Message
just to Caleb
 Im going to say
 its three buffalo or
buffalotype objects Creatures What do you want
me to do 
 Yes you can
 All right
 Yes I can hear you
 Its just one back and forth I can talk to
him he can reply once Thats it
 Is it Oh it is Ooh this is exciting Ive
never had magic before
 You dont know
 Youre drawing hamsters
 He said to come back so Im coming back On
the way back Im going to see if theyre eating
or sleeping What are they doing
 They could be good for meat We could go kill
them and eat them for meat
 You said to do the hand movements and the
whispery thing And I did it and it worked
 Yes
 Oh but we couldve eaten those buffalotype
creatures
 Three large beasts of burden Wait we could
use them to pull the cart
 They went that way In the dark
 I dont know I dont know what they were
but they looked big and able to pull the cart
 You want to go cowtipping dont you
 What happened
 Are we going to go after them or are we going
to go back to sleep
 Lets go
 
 Youll never know what they were
 Sorry
 Stop it
 Are we supposed to come back
 That was fast You really fought five guys in
an alleyway that fast
 Oh no hes injured
 Why are you drinking salt water

dirt
 Should we get back on the road then
 How is Horse doing today
 Hows Horse

 Very
 Oh Thisll help Hey side note
 wheres my
fucking wine
 Is it gone
 Oh wow What a cool map
 The enemies are just all over that
direction right
 
 So revealing
 I have an idea We need to move away from
here right Fjord
 All right I think I can do something that
would make them fire many of their arrows at
something but not us Should I do that and then
as soon as they fire their arrows we can run
 Diversions Thats what its called its a
diversion All right may I move is that a thing
 I take out a bit of fleece and repeating the
words and doing the hand gestures that Ive been
taught and tracing the image of a creature on the
fleece I will make a Silent Image of the guard
who told us  gold a gnoll Im going to have the
image of that guard dash across slowly dash
across this alleyway Like that way
 Yes not dash just walk in a way that he
could be easily shot
 Okay great that longhaired guard
individual
 Ooh nice
 I cast a spell Can I also move
 As soon as the arrows flew by Im going to
dash across the alley
 Yep As far as I can go
 Look at two unicorns inside

 Ten points of wait what did I say Nine
 Thank you
 Movement I will use to climb up into the
second floor window Thats not me The one next

better Athletics Its a straight ten
 
 I say
 This is fine

 Can I use my dash Was that all my movement
 Okay Ill use a bonus action to get Is
towards the window less fiery
 Sure
 It was two threes
 Rough
 Half cover Im done Hey look at that its

Trinket Is that what youre saying

 She may move if you move away from her 
feet she may just come with you
 Oh shit But you can leave her out in the
open
 Hits
 No
 Super advantage
 The grassy gnoll
 No really Thank you Sam
 How many are engaged with you right now
 Hey
 You have to save first
 Now close out of that
 You still have your action right
 I touched one
 Thats why they rolled so shit
 Just a little perspective here The gnolls
pushing away the cart how many are there And
what are they
 No obvious weak points on the cart or
anything
 Its going to take my bonus action to do so
Then I will not look at the cart
 Im sure it will but I dont know if I could
kill one in one shot Instead I will using my
goblin feet claws just dig in and Im going to go
upside down so I can see into where Beau is and
shoot one of the ones next to her
 I dont know
 The ones next to her
 Ugh Well I got to hit them
 The one that I hit before
 That is 
 Cool Im going to go pop back up to the top
floor and use my bonus action to hide
 Nope Ten
 Into the house
 Theres a really loud ticking clock in the
room with you
 I can take a shot at the cart but what is
one arrow going to do
 Does he have any disadvantage or anything
 He left
 No
 Okay
 
 Theres two gnolls in front of me that I can
see right
 The other one I will point at and I will
remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and
crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and
happens to a frogs wagon when it breaks down It
gets toad away And I will cast Hideous Laughter
on the gnoll
 
 The untouched one
 Okay All right Ill use my bonus action to
hide
 Oh I have to stealth Oh God damn Okay
thats 
 Thats the one you just hit
 How many are over there Oh I didnt see
it
 Hellish Snap
  Start up the full
 Those guards are killing more than we are
 Dont you want to ask that nameless guard how
he wants to do this
 Is it our turn soon Caleb and me
 I would like to jump down from the wall and
run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart
 Oh disadvantage Jesus 
 Dash everything
 Oh
 This is a saving throw thats not
disadvantage 
 Oh god
 Oh god
 Oh god
 Oh god
 Yeah
 But its a spider sense
 Your duplicate can cast spells

 Hits
 Oh shit
  Oh my gods
 I was just going to follow them from afar I
forgot they had bows and arrows
 I thought they wouldnt see me because of the
smoke Oh boy
 We dont have those
 Feed and Mead
 Should we divvy it up equally
 The Rod Bawn
 One
 I think hes got two glass eyes
 You seem so honest
 Is there a roving band of priests that are
trying to find you right now
 Are there any others of your family out there
on the run
 Doesnt sound that bad Yeah theyre not
going to kill you
 What about you Fjord Are you going to vomit
any seawater this morning
 Oh watch out
 It didnt seem like the whole thing was on
fire
 That was very scary One of them almost
killed me
 Thats true The hour rule
 What did you agree to
 Why are you yelling
 An hour All right
 Should we go over and talk to him
 Do we recognize this person
 Im not technically
 Ill join Well just go over and scare the
shit out of him
 Were you here when the attack happened
 Did you happen to see where they came from
 Thadeus did they seem to be after anything
in particular Were they here for property or
people or gold or food
 Dont engage them
 In Halfling I say to him Ive also been a
victim of a horrible attack
 Oh minus Ten
 This is really fascinating
 What if we find a dead body and bring it
back
 Does it start with an A Sometimes if you go
down through the alphabet A B
 With a Y That would have taken forever
 I cant read your dice at all
 She has a good eye for value
 Oh boy West Virginia
 While hes counting this out is there anyone
else in the store Anyone at all
 Do I see any little trinkets or anything
Little brass things Little baby bottles Anything
 Oh that one fell
 May I examine it
 Okay Im going to look at it Smell it Look
at the fluid Do I know anything about this
chemical at all

do much
 Sometimes Not a lot
 Speaking of and Ill ask him for the
components to make acid Does he have that stuff
 Okay How much for all this shit

 Just one
 All right Thats fine
 Wait no
 Do you sell any healing potions
 You asked that already
 Oh Never mind
 Were just going to go into the belly of the
beast Because one of them shot me and killed me
with an arrow We could draw them out
 Thank you so much but I dont want to be in
that predicament again Can we draw them out somehow
 They are fond of meat Heres my idea We
stage a barbecue contest Finest in the land All
the best barbecue will be there And then when
they come to sample our wares I run and you kill them
 Because you want to slow cook that stuff to
be really good Its true
 And maybe one extra horse
 Hes very smart

Cman will go get some incense and stuff

of us should hold that Maybe Fjord he seems sort
of responsible No dont make it a mustache

 It could blow up your face It could blow up

fair there was one trap I thought you meant any
sprung traps There was a trap
 I sussed it out Dont worry Ill take care
of it
  feet down the ziggedy zow and like 
feet down the zibbidy zoo
 Youre so smart
 Reverse psychology
 Oh reverse reverse psychology
 Right path

 Looks like this is the wrong path everyone
We should probably go back to the other Sorry

plan
 He says coyly Would you like to see the
layout of the room
 Seven

 Oh Yashas with us right

 Yeah theyve got like four hit points You
can take out two of them in one go If you were
you know Grog
 Were up on top up there
 Is there any way to even the playing field a
bit Any strategy Fjord and Caleb come on
 Maybe we could use that to escape later
 The other way This is it this is the other
way
 Its nothing
 Thats nothing
 No Im guessing
 Five gnolls Weve got these guys
 DD
 Maybe its the whiskey talking but I think
weve got these guys
 How far is it on the map from where were
standing to the farthest gnoll
 We can definitely do a distraction to get
some of them to turn away from us At least we get
a round in
 Okay Are you going to try your thing or
should I try my thing first
 I dont know I can try something I can do a
similar thing have them see something behind
them but you can do the same thing Yours are
already cast right
 Okay I could try to get one of them to fight
with one of the other ones of them
 Im going to sneak up down the steps to that
little crook in there
 Little further back yeah Is that all right
Do I have to roll or anything
 Oh shit Okay with disadvantage
 Oh so  That puts me within  feet of
those guys right
 And what are they doing Eating hearts
 Are they carrying anything on their bodies
on their person Anything canteens or weapons or
equipment or anything
 The gnolls
 Are any of them holding anything that they
put down for a second or they got it firmly in
their claws
 Are you going to do your thing
 I dont know You tell me
 What are those words
 I whisper a couple words and use Mage Hand to
pick up the little piece of shoulder blade he
dropped and throw it in the face of the other
guy
 They dont care Thought they would kill each
other I dont know That was it Were level
three thats all I got
 Im going to turn around and whisper to
using Message so no one can hear us Are you
going to do the thing If not I can do my thing
 Damn
 Oh I get a turn as well Because I did the
Mage Hand thing
 Mildly
 Sure Ill send an arrow down into the one
that Jester attacked

 Crouch back and hide

the two buttons

giveaways or something
 What were you supposed to say
 Should you be talking about him out in the
open like that
 Hes a new god
 Give us a hint
 That is cool
 But do you talk to him
 You were in Alfield
 It seems like its harder to get over to the
Pillow Trove maybe you could have them forward
your mail to here or something like that
 Or if we had some sort of a PO box
 We need to get you some nicer clothes then
 Weve been sitting drinking right
 Weve been plotting our next moves
 This is your jam
 What time is it
 Actually what season is it Are we north Is
it going to get cold
 Can you pick me up earmuffs
 That sounds amazing I will do that
 Are all the sewer grates blocked with a
lock
 To this one
 Count again
 Before I go can I borrow that ring of water
walking
 Not that one that one or that one I know
what those are
 Yeah Thats it

 I dont know if you have to attune to it but
Im going
 All right Ill go down there with Yasha
MATT You climb down and join Yasha there You can
see the slight decline behind you as it progresses
away from the direction of where this current seems to
have happened Once again the smell is stagnant
a combination of waste product and whatever else
has rotted and congealed down there That smell of
bacteriafilled liquid and water Continuing
upward it curves a little bit to the right and
out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that
bounces off the slick wall There is a weird humid
warmness to the air down here Its not extremely
pleasant You dont see anything else in here other than
what look to be clusters of waste combined with
sticks and whatever else has washed down here
through previous storms and has begun to build up
blockages here and there maybe a foot two feet across
 Are we going to keep going Or should we get
the
 Its fine Just come down
 Its a trap were all going to die
 Monsters are down
 Im going to get down and take a little bit
of the smear and
 Do I taste anything
  Plus five No plus three
 Its old diarrhea
 Familiar
 This is bloody stool

 I know this taste I know it well
 Its sort of like Pringles where you just
cant have one
 So somethings been killed and dragged that
way
 Im going to look for footprints
 Thats a one
 Ill be right behind them
 Middlerear
 As I see everybody doing this Im going to
take a big swig of liquor
 Yep yep Its definitely because of that
Look at this sewer Is that real wet
 
 Theres a couple rats within range of my
allies right So that I could get sneak attack
 Okay Ill disengage back away down that
hall that way get far enough away then turn
around back go  and fire my crossbow at
the one next to Jester No thats Molly
  plus four I think
 Okay Thats a lot of ds Right Yeah
Okay so 
 Its a small hole the bolt makes
 Thats it
 Tomato juice bath

 Wheres our order
 All right Nott will go forward next to Caleb
and peer around and fire another crossbow
 I know I havent been in any gas I dont
know whats going on All I can see is you guys
going  like weirdos So Ill fire
 
 Theres sneak attack damage too right
 Thats a lot In the teens
 I guess I will
 If theres a way to pin the rat to the wall
Ill do that
 I would never hit you
 I care for you Caleb
 I am extremely scared right now but I think
that we killed the monster and we can go back to
surface now right
 That was clearly something down here thats
been killing people
 Spiders dont like rats do they
 Did you see the one that kind of looked like
a dog though That was freaky
 Are we going that way
 Were going a different way
 Stealth checks Can you help someone there
Jester
 Not me I dont need it
 Ten Not so good
 Or a body
 You think its dead
 Should we go try to cut it down Without
alerting them
 Wait Should we get ready for some sort of
distraction or to do something to the other web first
 No no I just
 Steal from the dead bodies
 I agree Yeah
 I like that idea
 But then well get to see it and get the
drop on it
 Yeah What if theyre still alive
 Oh yeah thats good
 Or maybe they just were wrapped up five
minutes ago and theyre totally fine
 She wonders if the giant spider heard it
 Should we get into some sort of position so
were not all clumped together
 Ill go behind Caleb
 Theres things behind us too
 Im going to go  feet behind us
 Thats a one
 Its not behind us
 Nothing back here
 Wait no But thats a person
 All clear in the back
 No need
 It snuck up on us
 Five
 Because we save it for when it really
counts
 Im probably screaming
 
 You have a one with the stand
 Hes busy
 Thats all of the poison damage
 We are all going to die because of the Golden
Snitch
 Okay Im going to shout out
 I think this is
the monster I will nervously fire my hand
crossbow at the beast hoping not to hit any of my
friends  plus something Six 
 Yeah   Plus Fury of the Small
 points

 Yeah I scramble away in Calebs direction
and that cocoon guy there Im going to hide right
behind him
 Okay A 
 Healing Word No its not
 Do your thing
 What happened to the healing coming
 Wow
 We killed it
 Is someone going to heal Fjord
 Okay Oh boy Ill stay put and hold my
attack until I can see the whites of its pincers
As a bonus action Ill cast Mage Hand and start
digging around some rocks see if theres anything
over there
 Not anymore
 Yeah
 I dont know
 You can use the bonus action granted by your
cunning action to control the hand
 Got it Then nevermind
 Im holding my attack
 Wow
 From where Im hidden to where it was when it
appeared how far is that
 So I have to roll with disadvantage

be there for me when I need safety I need him I
need him to live

keen eye

were with me Its when we went down into the
basement to scout around for other entrances into
the bottom of the Leaky Tap
 I found a skeleton that had these bracelets
on her Him They
 Yeah I dont know I didnt really have time
to look at it
 A very old dead person Could be ancient
 I didnt think about that but yes
 I dont think its haunted or anything It
just seemed like someone it was stuffed way in
the corner behind some boxes 
like someone wanted to
 I didnt I mean
Im really just interested in these

 These are just bracelets that I found I was
wondering if you could use your magic skills
 No but theyre shiny and nice
 Ooh Maybe I could
 Are they big

show you if youd like but it didnt seem like
 How do you do that Where you look at
something and you just see what it is

many things Youre very strong Im continually
impressed by you I must say How strong would you
say you are On a scale of one to

abilities or blessings

great things and I just want to help you get

 Seeing Caleb walk away with the object Im

the object glowing about  feet away from them
on the ground 
 Yeah I guess
 My spell DC is Its plus Oh sorry hold

 Its plus three is my spellcasting modifier
 Okay
 It just gives you
 Advantage to charisma rolls
 Im staying put and as soon as the guard
gets close Ill make it slowly rise up into the
sky just like   feet up
 This is Silent Image I can move it I just
cant make it make a sound
 
 Its bigger than that
 Im still doing illusion shit Have I
finished that
 Ill make it inflate and then Salvador Dal
start dripping Just like 
 Its going to start to boil and fizzle into
steam and dissipate
 Then Ill try to rejoin them
 I know who theyre talking about
 Whats going on Where are we going
 The secret cellar where I found nothing
Where we found a skeleton
 Yes
 Long enough for the body to decompose
 Wait wait why does it need to be lead I
mean you can turn anything into lead cant you
 Oh Why does it have to be that particular
material
 Pumat would have something
 Smart
 Look at us Were like a team
 Break
 The stone
 Oh intrigue
 Who What Who are you talking about
 This is the place Are you with us
 This is the place I was talking to you about
The skeletons right over there
 What
 What would that do
 All right Very smart as always
 With the skelly
 If we slept in our rooms
 But what if someone breaks in and were here
Then were attached to these objects I mean Ill
sleep down here if you want Maybe we can get rid
of the skelly first
 Whats wrong Caleb
 All right Im game
 What I mean we dont know what Fjord and
the grumpy one have discovered Maybe we should go
upstairs and reconnoiter with them and then come
down here when its time for beddybye
 All right Ill stay with you then
 Oh yes I can do that Should I do that and
then come back later
 Youre just going to stay here in this dank
dark room with a skeleton by yourself no dinner
All right
 All right Ill be back in less than an hour
 Flush
 Two floors below were putting a skull

 Yorick
 So weve got some stuff What did we get
 This I will taste it I will lick the safe
 Its ironic Its not what we want
 You did very well considering its after
midnight and you got a metal box for free
 I dont know can I tell its lead I mean
iron not lead
 Okay Just a straight intelligence check
 
 Oh Its a very wellmade safe
 Hes downstairs for now but I am in constant
communication with him
 I take out my piece of wire and I do my
skeleton come to life and kill you Please respond
to this message
 Hes a prankster

 Hes good ol Cay
 Yeah
 Lauren Spinach
 Should we change to a different hotel
 Wait she was selling this place because of
us
 I should put on my pants
 Why does he need to leave the city
 Why do you need to leave Whos suspicious of
you
 You can take Caleb and my room
 Well be spending the night somewhere else
 I get to spend the night with that guy
 Ill take Calebs share and give it to him
 I can take it downstairs later and have
CayCay take a look at it
 Why dont I just have Caleb look
 Ill take the daggers unless you can use
them to throw I can throw them at things I think
 Thats how they say it in Kentucky
 I think that was more you than the dagger
though
 For safety
  Yes because of
 Oh All right
 Yeah because of the thing Calebs idea
 Im the help
 All right sure I take out my wire I do my
Caleb are we going to abscond with the
dodecahedron in the dead of night You can reply
to this message and only I can hear your reply
 Yes we are
 Were not going to steal it Hes scared of
that thing why would we take it away from you
 We do what we need to do to survive
 So what The plan was to leave no trace
not take nothing He was very clear at the outset
that we were doing this for money
 No
 We caused a giant explosion we destroyed a
rug we broke into two different places Mollymauk
was seen by guards outside of both there was
plenty of traces we left behind I opened a box
that froze me for an hour
 Yeah Im pretty sure someones going to
notice that that box has been opened
 Im just saying him taking a scroll is small
potatoes
 What Caleb does is well thoughtout and
always intentional and smart
 Stockholm Syndrome
 No Im not Explain that to me
 What are you implying
 Sure The scorpion rides on the turtles
back
 Whatever Caleb says happens next

 Stay away from the water is what I take from
it
 All right so you are all apologizing for not
trusting Calebs judgment
 Not you
 All right and what exactly have you done to
earn our trust
 Im not talking about life or death
 Ive saved your lives Caleb has saved your
lives
 Tonight Caleb got that dodecafuckballs out
of there by himself
 He has slain things he has saved things and
I have as well If were talking about trust what
on earth have any of you people done to earn our
trust What have you done that we have requested Ever
 I like you
 When we signed up for this job Caleb was
very explicit He said we are doing this for coin
and treasure and thats what we got
 There was no surprises here were in it for
what we can grab for ourselves
 I think theres a bit of a misconception here
 Caleb and I have a very special relationship
It is that of a parent and a child But I am the
parent You do understand that correct I protect
him Hes my boy and I keep him safe I want
him to thrive and get better and better and more
powerful and stronger Because he can achieve
great things When I found him he was nothing He
was a scared little boy in the corner of a jail
cell As we have gotten more comfortable he has
gotten more comfortable and come out of his shell
Its my job to protect him because I love him
and I am his protector Not because he protects me
 Hes going to be a great man someday
 That seems like it would be suspicious
 I dont know that
 Ill have a talk with him
 Thats very nice Beau
 Yeah I could tell that there was at least
six more fucks in there that you held back

 Thats progress
 As soon as you give me the stuff you want
identified And youll have to trust me that we
wont run away with it in the dead of night
 Hey youre the one who hypnotized me into
talking about stuff
 Yeah you think thats what friends do to
each other
 I dont think so You think thats cool
Beau
 I was not stealing I was searching for
something to steal
 Thats besides the point
 I dont have Friends he hasnt taught me
that one yet
 All right
 Maybe you guys can have a talk with her
tonight
 I know shes drunk but
 Im going to leave now
 Have a good night dont break into our room
Ill go down with Caleb
 I stole this fucking scroll for you
 The one from the Richters
 I got it I went back and got it
 No
 Thank you for saving me tonight You brought
me back from the dead Oh I think you used a
potion on me didnt you
 Here take one of mine I have two its
okay
 Of course You keep me safe
 Thank you We lived huh
 The folks upstairs gave me some more things
for you to check out as well Are these things you
can do
 Okay
 Oh
 All right
  Oh no
 Oh shit Was it loud enough that anyone else
could hear
 It was that Agoura Hills earthquake
 Smoke
 I forget how this works does he have your
hit points
 Was there anything in the box
 Its a good spell
 What did we get
 What did we get what did we get
 Yes
 Sinterklaas
 Oh and these daggers too
 Its a longsword
 Can I use that
 
 Too big for me I know my limits
 Well should we go to sleep
 Oh heres your  platinum and your two
gold and one extra platinum for some reason as
if that were supposed to smooth things over Oh
and also they dont trust us they think we need
to cooperate more theyre trying
 They are very upset
 They were very upset that we tried to take
the scroll box
 Because they are in the firm belief that it
would have left some sort of clue that would have
led the authorities to us by stealing something
after we had broken into two houses stolen other
things torn up a rug
 Not stealing the seal
 Sure Also she was dressed as the Richter
not wearing the correct outfit
 Sure But they are under the impression that
and this a fair point that we are not very
communicative or We dont behave as much as
part of a team as they would prefer I said that I
would tell you and discuss And so thats where
it stands with the weirdos
 I think what would make it work is letting
them take the lead a bit and following
 Oh no not at all
 But we can just see how it goes playing
ball I suppose
 The Soltryce Academy thing
 What You didnt get in
 Did you do something wrong Or bad
 You dont have to tell me what it was or
what you did but is it something that you can be
forgiven for
 Our own academy
 All right Itll take a little longer
probably Im not a good teacher
 All right well Ill help wherever I can I
do enjoy seeing you get new spells and new skills
 I think for me too Ive had more people
throw rocks at me than conversations and its
nice You know what its nice with them too
They dont seem to mind that you know my teeth
are a little People find that offputting
sometimes
 Well theyre not as smart as you are so
 Thats nice
 I prefer the skeleton actually
 Ill go on that side of the room
 Night Caleb
 How do you do this on DD Beyond
 Oh no
 Im in the room
 Where do we go
 Bring your dice so we can roll
 How do you play Dungeons  Dragons
 I got scared of the skeleton so I came over
here
 That was like two minutes
 We had no time to do anything
 I roll a d
 Eight
 When I leveled up it already gave me two
extra hit points Why
 Okay so now I add the extra eight
 Oh my god I just got ten extra hit
points
 No shes dead now
 Ooh
 Thats a lot
 Do we have to find Dolan now
 Weve got to get our Nip on Ooh wait maybe
not
 Oh god we havent fed the horses in days
 So we left the horses at a stable or
something Okay Theyre not dead in an alley
somewhere
 Get a big catapult and just
 Wait we know a smuggler
 Who was the guy who first showed us around
the city
 Yeah
 Their sister
 I totally forgot about that
 Or maybe Pumat would have some sort of a
magicalencasing
 He doesnt care does he
 We should write Tusk Love and sell it on the
store
 Was he in Alfield She They Were they in
Alfield
 Bryce Fayled Felllid Feelid
 If Caleb was in the room when Bryce said it
then Caleb would know
 There was no sister
 Well if Matt doesnt recall the sister then
it was Claudia
 Mystery solved
 We did it
 Well that takes one thing off the list We
The Gentleman What else
 Thats the Gentleman also
 The Leaky Nip I mean the Evening Nip
should we go there
 He was telling us about blacksmiths before
Theres the Spark Hammer Smith We could go to the
Spark Hammer Smith in the Pentamarket
 I think we actually have been there before
 Yannick Jan
 He got  new spells
 Im a student of magic
 Were going to go to the Spark Hammer
Smiths Smithys
 Can it just be leadlined Is that a thing
 Everybody knows her mom
 What is that What does it do
 One little interjection Couldnt we use the
sending thing to find out information if we sent a
message
 We could disguise our voice and say Weve
been made Send instructions and find out what
happens
 Sometimes if you scroll through and find a
listing for mom
 We could probably divvy up the equipment at
Pumats He wont ask any questions
 You did not
 What That seems terrible
 Oh my god
 
 This is normal its okay
 Wait Mr Pumat what is it made of What
does it do
 Ive heard of the material but does it have
any other magical properties
 Okay
 Yeah to replenish
 Mr Pumat I have another request I know
that I had requested would it be possible to
invent a small haversack Just the pocket thing
But do you have any sort of magic incantation
ability if I gave you a flask could you make it
never run out of alcohol
 How much would that RD cost me
 Ill take it

 Heres my platinum flask Could you also put
a nice little flourishy design on the side of the flask
 Oh wow
 Thats nothing Its nothing at all
 Sure Here take it
 Yep All up front
 Go to your DD Beyond app it has all the
manuals
 Maybe you should cancel the order Have him
make something else
 A flask
 Did we get any healing potions
 Do you need any more Caleb
 It gets caught in the corners
 Good stuff
 We still havent gone there have we Weve
heard about it like seven times
 Wait he likes small critters Like me
 Hes cool right
 What was the first one
 Well be twinsies
 Wait a minute what does that mean
 Nothing
 Whatcha reading
 They will probably have it
 Sounds like shite Caleb There are much
better books out there
 Goodbye
 To the Tap Why are we going there now Oh
to the box thing
 Is the skeleton alive
 Can we put the box in the
 Oh wait we cant put the box in the bag
 Crossing the streams
 Still crossing the streams
 Yes the items
 Ill take those
 Why do we only have one
 How many weapons can you wield
 Gone forever
 I defer to the wisdom of the group We merely
follow your expert wisdom
 No I am sincere
 What is that crazy expression

 I saw your gums for a second It was freaky
 I forgot we had that
 The Gentleman
 We were going to investigate Kara who was
going to the bar that the Gentleman frequents
 If it happens if it comes up
 Oh yeah we have to send the guards to find
the evidence Oh god
 And we stole a seal
 Hmm
 Oh boy
 Oh did we get paid
 Fuck that
 So well go to the Evening Nip
 Are we gonna do this Are we doing the
Gentleman
 Im so scared right now
 Mazel tov
 Who What
 What Whos that
 Hes actually a robot
 An hour ago you were telling me that I had to
trust you people You lying fuckers
 Make a whisper
 Oh what
 Just at the bar
 What
 
 We did not walk right past you We looked
around Youre big we would have seen you
 Do I have to change my name in this club
 We should all come up with different names
 Thats the tabaxi not the ogre
 We know a lot
 We were told the name of the group that you
traveled with but I cant remember it now
 Me
 Im the worst 
 No you can tell us about the ritual
Ritual
 Yes it was successful Remind me what it was
again Theres been so many rituals lately
 Not the Tomb Takers that was the splinter
group right
 That is not a good answer
 Fjord say something
 Caleb are we doing this
 All right Ill follow suit
 
 Lets gamble
 I watched her play last time I could do I
dont 
 Why dont you do it Ill just drink I need
just a little loosener
 Oh god
 Have we seen anything suspicious from the
deals or the
 Plus four
 Did you start with  though
 Thats the first thing weve ever won

 We did Yes We fought and killed a giant
spider of sorts
 Is that the goliath
 Sorad
 Were very strong
 As you can see Yasha is very strong
  We dont know anything about that
We had nothing to do with it
 Ill offer him a napkin
 He seems like he needs
 Hes schvitzing I mean its not even humid
in here  Hes got a problem
 How do we know that you can clear our name
Weve proven to you that were lucky You know our
reputation We dont know anything about you
 If I may we passed a test for you Would you
pass one for us
 May I have three of those vials Just the
empty ones
 If I were to fill two of these vials with
ordinary alcohol and one with something else
would you be able to tell which is which With
your discerning eye and your years of experience
 Ill take out my shitty flask as my good one
is gone Fill two vials with alcohol and then take
out my vial of acid and pour it into the third
Are they reasonably the same colorish
 All right Ill take a little splash of
alcohol and some darker stuff and mix it around
 All right this one is the acid these two
are booze And now I will try to 
 
 Yes
 If you die Im sorry
 Ooh shit thats baller
 I dont know what to roll Its d or
something What do I I got to look
 Its here Acid vial
 d
 
   Yep yeah thats good That
was impressive I mean you pass the test sir
  
 You know Dander
 Why are you locking your iPad between every
move
 Trying to throw it in the garbage but it hit
your balloon
 Can I wander over and see if I can overhear
anything
 
 If youre not going to answer any questions
can we please direct some to Yasha over here
 Where were you Whered you go Why did you
leave
 She left us before we were ambushed in
Alfield and when she left us this time we almost
died in this plot to overthrow the empire or
whatever it was with Crick soldiers Maybe its
related
 If you told us what it was we could help
you
 Lots of pressure Maximum amount of
pressure
 I am not
 It seemed like the Gentleman whos very
impressive by the way knows a lot about stuff
including the fact that we were involved in a plot
to frame the Sutan fellow
 Do you think he would know if the Xhorhas
invasion at the same time as our little plan was a
bigger conspiracy Were we set up
 I dont know but it seems coinkydinky that
we were there on a night when towers were
exploding
 Youre so coy
 What was it
 Oh Xhorhas assassins tried to steal a box of
some sort that was a weapon of mass destruction or
a portal to another dimension or some sort of
fount of energy that powers their race we have no
idea but they stole it we encountered them in
the sewers we did not kill the Xhorhas assassin
but he was killed shortly thereafter and we stole
his magical dodecahedron
 All you need to know is the people from
Xhorhas are dead now Do you know people from
Xhorhas
 Who are you
 Yes
 Youre a Cr Can I say Crick Is that okay
Do I have to be a Crick to say it
 Youre from that part of the world
 You dont know if you were born there or grew
up there
 Dont we need to talk to Kara
 No Shes right here today
 Ah Ill eat you
 Do you know Lucien too
 I think theyre talking about the sword
 Jester has it doesnt she
 Jester by the way you seriously Your
farts have been disgusting tonight Ive been
sitting next to you all night  and its just
foul Foul
 We can pass out the sword later but do you
think its something you could use
 What does she wield usually
 Could you have it as a backup weapon or
something
 Could you dual wield
 Sure
 I could use it as a makeshift shelter
 Can I just clock the tabaxi and see where
that satchel with our blood in it is Did she
happen to put it down while she was over
 Why Why would I do that
 I do not
 People hate me
 Theres no part of this that I want But if
youd like to go over there Ill be your second
 Yeah Id be comfortable talking to that
little crazy gnome

something that I would ever just do just to just
see But well leave that for another day
 Question Go back two beats You said Who
cares about what happened before
 Do you really not want to know your past
Answer truthfully
 Yasha has a crush on me
 Nonagon
 Im sorry to belabor this but what if you
had a good life before this What if you were
famous or rich or had friends or family
 Empty
 What do you mean yes You can imagine what
its like what its like to not feel anything
before this moment Have you died before
 Thats true
 But its not who you are
 Is the Moonweaver not real
 If you always lie and bullshit how are we
ever going to believe you
 He has to be telling the truth
 Which tattoos are the old ones I mean I
dont want to see your naked body or anything But
do you have some
 What does that mean What does it mean
Caleb what does it mean
 Red eyes or something
 Get out the black light
 Theyre not tattoos
 Theyre just markings
 They were just there
 No thats very interesting Good to know
 I feel like we should do this every night
 Its terrible
 Its like a kid with a soft mustache thats
not like a real you know like a
 I think that you need to know where youve
been to know where youre going and I respect your feelings
 I feel like when youre ready to know your
past I would support that and I would help you
find it

 Throwing a dagger just seems so inelegant to
me I dont know why Theyre meant to cut food

extra flair or baubles to it that would be fine

 Was it the saltwater dream
 You need to work on vivid dreams You can
control yourself Lucid dreaming yeah

it
 Oh wait wheres our dynamite Didnt we have

in any of the fights yesterday were you
 But you remained pretty much unscathed
 And that was the only day that you let me put
flowers in your hair right
 Im saying maybe sometimes old wives tales
are true
 As an experiment
 This is a focus group test thing I dont

braid in his hair and stick a little flower stem
or two in there and try to make a little flower

 You had said that you did your own dental
work at one point Did you do that On purpose
 Why

Russian sub commander

going to cast Disguise Self and turn myself into
looking just like a normal halfling little girl
and spend an hour at a cafe just having lunch and
being a normal person

 Its nice that you guys are talking about
your limitations and setting your expectations
before you go into this together Theres some
word that you need like a safething
 Sure
 
 What does that mean Fragment of
Possibility
 No he wont He will never tell us
 Caleb are you okay You went skinkydoodle
for a second Are you all right Hello Hello
Wildemount to Caleb
 He cant speak anymore hes forgotten
 Eins Zwei Drei Hes forgotten all
language
 Quick Make out with him True loves kiss is
the only thing that will bring him back
 Just make out with him
 I mean it was on my mind but I wasnt going
to bring it up

 Or dont disappoint you
 Thats not not that part
 You said Oh I wish I could share my
problems with my friends
 It is
 We dont have to tell the others about this
do we I mean were supposed to be a team
 What Why would that no
 We all know what that experience is like
 You need extra luck for that
 Can I just say real quick before we
adjourn there was something that you were
reluctant to do because of your own personal
fears and you entrusted Jester to inspire you to
do something that was possibly uncomfortable for
you and it worked out great I think that moving
forward if you want to just go for it As long as
you have trusted friends with you then that would
be a good option to do
 Hes not my son
 Get out Just go Just leave
 Who was it who killed her
  What does it say
  Mote of Possibility
 Custom items
 Do we need to dress up Matt
 What kind of festival This is a winter
festival

disadvantage

 All right well then Ill dash and Ill go
back around towards me behind this corner and
hide Just duck back there Thats it Take a
swig
 Just run away What could happen

 Everyone
 Wait
 Wait What if we just stood next to all the
doors and held our action until something came out
of them
 What are you talking about
 Yeah but we get a hit in on them the second

 We would get a surprise round on them
 Yeah so pick four people Ill take one of
them

 This ones fine it dont matter
 
 Wait we come in from one of the doors so

 Im ready to shoot anything that comes out of
this door
 No Im not I have a crossbow feat
 I I let my crossbow bolt go
 Just out into the Oh fuck No not at it
Nope
 That is a huge thing
 Would have gotten two hits in
 Were just as far away from the thing
 Yeah but there was two people standing next
to that door
 At one point there was Fjord and Caleb
 If you had stuck to the plan you would have
gotten two hits and were all just as far away as
we were before
at the start of this final round
 Well you shouldnt have been that far away
 
 Is the giant in melee Would I get sneak
attack damage or no Hes not engaged with anybody
right now
 Okay then I will shriek and I will run
towards Beau full sprint
 Its north east west south
 Sneak attack damage is so good but I cant

over there that wall
 North always points to the star

 Okay not too hard to hit
 Go for it

 Look at you youre a killer
 Turn into water

plan
 But wait you get to dispel magic
  Do we heal or do we get this guy
 No I mean Molly
 All right Ill clock around the corner and
fire off a shot
  to hit
 Okay
 Ew terrible
 Nine points of damage
 No Im not a
 You can perform one of these  use a
bonus action to control the hand Fuck Okay I
cant cast Mage Hand as a bonus action with
Legerdemain or whatever right I can only use it
Okay then I will fire again why not Natural

 Damn it Okay thats not good
 My turn
 I will look up at the giant man who just hit

running away I can do which is only  feet
Towards Caleb to the north and if I can get
behind that pillar
 Other side possibly
 All right
 Go heal Yasha
 Go heal Yasha
 You can do whatever you want
 You can get it over there
 Im going to take a healing potion
 Then Ill walk around the other side of the
pillar so I get a good clean shot Am I within 
feet I want to be within  feet
  Ready to go
 Are we allowed to attack or no
 We werent holding our action for when they
I guess we never said it
 Oh fuck I thought it was implied we were
just waiting for it to wake up

 That is  points of damage
 Trying not to hit Yasha or Beau I would love
the bolt to go through its belly as far as it can go
 Do we win yet
 No dont draw any attention to me no dont

 As we walk by can I try to untie the old
guys shoelaces
 
 But how will I drink

spying on before
 Okay

 Hes going to die tomorrow in war
 We all are
 Didnt I tell you guys Theres a war
starting tomorrow
 I overheard them Yes
 Were all going to die We should leave now
 No you should You werent with us the night
that all this went down so they would not suspect
you of anything
 Just ask them about what happened the other
night and the Crick that they killed
 Who they work for We know who they work for
What do we need from them
 Oh Why dont you just act like you know more
than you do Like  Whoa I hear
wars coming tomorrow What about that
 Abort abort abort
 Super cock
 I ran a halfikithon once
 What information did you glean
 Why What happened
 The Kryn is the kingdom over there
 Yasha Just so we know and can I trust you
But if theres anything that we need to know now
would be a good time to tell us so that were not
in danger Are you a Xhorhasian spy come here to
do bad things to the empire
 Well why are you here then Why did you
flee
 Well I want to know in case theyre going to
come try to kill you and kill me by accident
 Plausimonamonaminity
 I just want to know if youre on their side
or the Xhorhasian side so that when this war
comes that were not caught in the crossfire
Thats all
 Im on my side
 You mean what theyre fighting
 In Xhorhas
 The Kryn
 Did they do bad things to your people
 That sucks
 Did you know anyone who went
 Should we divide up the money
 Great
 East

 What services are available
 The best available
 Yasha if you were to partake of a companion
what kind of companion are you interested in Is
it like a beast type of a thing or
 Maybe its a check
 Beautiful handwriting
 Yes of course
 Thats nice
 Marian Thats a beautiful name
 Chanel
 Color printer
 Thats a lot of money For all of us
 She gave you  gold before
 Did you tell her that you were out of money
 And this is all she sent
 Maybe I dont know your mother maybe she
was testing the postal system Sending a small
amount as a test You can write back and say Got
it safely feel free to send more
 Maybe that was it Because I wouldnt want to
send  gold over the mail system Theres
people out there who steal the mail
 The most important thing is that she loves
and cares for you and wants to support you from
afar
 Those are the absolute most basic you can
have
 Mostly paper is white too
 I dont know how it works
 Wait just so Im clear
 Do you get a full
release massage while youre eating a steak or
something
 I rolled a 
 Message received
 Huh Nothing I didnt say anything
 I was practicing a new catchphrase
 Thats why Im practicing
 Its a little heady
 Yeah Hey you know what Did you order the
room service yet
 I think the phones broken so maybe me and
Beau should go deliver the order downstairs
 Oh We didnt eat our rats yet
 I mean theyll die
 Oh
 Should we toast now
 Uh no
 No
 No
 Give me your rat and Ill have them cook it
and bring it back for you
 I wont eat your rat
 Do you promise not to kill me in my sleep
because youre a Xhorhasian spy
 If I dont eat your rat you cant kill me in
my sleep because youre a Xhorhasian spy
 All right Lets go order some food
 As soon as we get out of the room I say

 Sure Right it does take a while to deliver
All right we go order food first
 Im going to send a few Messages out Caleb

But why
 Oh
 From your town
 How old were you
 You were just students

 Fake memories
 Wait there was a false memory He tricked
you
 But you didnt know what you were doing
 You were brainwashed
 Programmed
 What do you mean hidden
 I dont think its
 You want to stay here
 Good evening
 I go over and I throw my arms around him and
hug him Im so sorry It wasnt you its not
your fault It wasnt you you were made to do it
Its not your fault Its not your fault I know
you dont realize that now but you will This
pain that you have that you wear all over you
like a mask its just that and you can take it
off someday I know it hurts but it wasnt your
fault Im going to keep telling you that until
you believe me
 What you did was awful truly terrible
despicable and unforgivable until you can
forgive it At some point youll have to do that
I swear to you that I will be at your side until
you do
 Really
 A lot of books
 Im in Whatever you need just tell me and
Ill get it for you

 Insight check 
 I think shes lying
 Before we leave shouldnt we get a lay of
the land I mean I trust my own ears theyre
very large but I barely heard half of a
conversation I dont even know really whats
happening other than I heard that theres a war
happening
 Well maybe we should do some snooping around
town and find out if there indeed is a war before
we leave town
 We also have allies here We have The
Gentleman
 Dolan We havent even checked in with him
 We have a bunch of allies We cant just up
and leave without at least saying like were out
 I have never had allies before
 Because those are funnysounding names
 Its also where there was a string of
kidnappings
 I dont like this idea
 Me too
 Its a more festive atmosphere
 Insight check
 
 Do you wear makeup
 I think its worn off
 Should I be
 Do you think I should be more of a normie for
this
 Thats for when we steal things and I
pretend to be his baby and he pretends to be my
mama Then when theyre looking at the cute baby
he steals something
 Ill be a dwarf
 I can disguise myself as well
 Ill cast Disguise Self and be a little
halfling girl
 Veth
 How about one more hour Well all
compromise
 Of course would you like a drink Are we
allowed to drink in here Why are you carrying
around a cup
 Are you reading these things out loud
 Caleb when you were muttering there did you
say Dolan Tversky
 Theyre in a different campaign
 Im half sea monster
 Were going to go to Pumats as well
 Healing potions do you have any

 Well Beau do you want us to stay together
 All right
 Yeah maybe well rustle up WC Loo John
Crapper Shitter and Toilet

that kind of commitment
 Youre going to make an adventuring party
very happy some day
 Does anyone know what a Hawker is
 So many choices
 Pros and cons
 Investigators

 What does that mean

 Question
 Will she come willingly

 One more thing though our other offer was
for  gold Seems like maybe you could match
that just to make it a little bit more equal
 Or like a bumper pool table that we can
all
 Well Molly youve been talking about
getting out of town
 It gets us out of town
 The shitty swamp
 Also this way gets us to go straight through
Hupperdook
 Im just saying
 Its like a cool name for a town
 Hupperdook
 Theyve got a soft serve place there Itll
be great
 We know those monsters though I took care
of all those traps Could someone remind me
because when The Gentleman looks at me I get a
little bit yeah you know flippityflee
 No the sweat thing bothers me
 I think its sweat
 To hide all the sweat stains on his
undershirt I dont know Its just weird right
Like hes always sweating
 Thats true
 Yes Anyway I missed the whole part about
the swamp Whats that mission again
What do we have to do
 But wait find the safehouse and do what to
it
 Secure it
 Straight shot
 Yeah Im special Nott has a dot matrix
printer
 Oh yes it is
 Jester do you think people who live in
Hupperdook are called Dookies
 Or Huppers
 We should call them Dookies for sure
 If I may Yasha Were going to be really
close to your old you know place where you lived
 Yes
 Xhorhas isnt just here Xhorhas goes all
the way up here
 Oh its the Greying Wildlands Oh
 Yes of course Ill come with you Fjord
 Well will you be reassigning it very quickly
if we dont take it
 Thats the Lebenda one
 It sounds like its going to be no sweat
Well stay high and dry
 Crapper Shitter WC Toilet John
 One of each
 No This has really whet our appetite
 I just cant stop staring at his face its
soaking wet Sorry
 Dont sweat the small stuff
 Just going to leave a handkerchief Just in
case
 Theres nothing at Pumats anymore
 Here it is

 Are you just going to walk
 Do four horses pulling the cart and two
solo
 Six We have six horses
 We have six horses
 Yes Only five of them have names We never
came up with a name for the sixth horse
 Loaf is a good name We have
 WC Lou John
Crapper Toilet and Loaf
 I want it as well
 Thats the name of the horse
 Oh no
 Did you not have cat where you grew up
 Did they have dogs
 Its nighttime now
 We should not let them do that
 Why would you tell me that Now Im very
scared
 Did we bring any warm clothes
 Were the worst
  Romantically
  Eight months ago
 Great first date
 Me and Caleb Me and Molly I guess Im on
third watch
 You dont know
 Oh ten Why is it disadvantage
 If it makes you feel any better I lost money
on Jester on the next one
 Probably Unless he mops himself down at
night
 Wait think about his sheets What a disaster
his sheets must be
 No my hometown is further to the south its
the opposite direction
 Yes But there is no hometown We travel
around a lot we have an area of operation but
never really called one place home
 Yeah theres tents and some people sleep in
bags or huddle together
Whatever we can find really leaves
 No its terrible Would you like that
 No its not fun at all You find whatever
piece of cloth you can and wrap yourself in it and
some mud and thats your bed Its terrible
 That and many other things yes Have you
ever seen a goblin before
 Yes Well have you seen any others
 Have you heard stories of them
 I mean you can tell me Theres no love
there Everything youve heard about goblins is
true Theyre awful in every way
 All right so thats true But it doesnt
really matter if youre good or bad we will come
and steal you if you are a child anyway
 Take it easy We would share with the rest of
the clan But of course we would eat children
 Im really not Goblins are terrible
terrible creatures
 With great honesty I can tell you that Ive
never eaten a child
 Kind of hard to read
 Listen My clan I cant speak for other
clans but the goblins that I was with for quite
some time we stole from people We stole food we
stole money when we could we stole clothing and
provisions but when times were tough we would
steal the people too
 Well goblins dont really Im sure I have
parents
 Yeah Once a child is born and nursed for a
bit and then its communal property As soon as
you can work they give you a job and you do the
job
 Everyone in the clan I assume is related
somehow but
 Yeah There was no real family ties
 Caleb as always is right I do not have an
urge to kill and eat children
 I do have cravings for things I assume you
other species do not
 Rats
 Cats sometimes
 Bacon I really like bacon
 Just in general meat is pretty good but no
A human child is a wonderful thing Why would I
want to kill or hurt a human child
 No Im not bloodthirsty I just get hungry
for food sometimes Not for flesh I just like meat
 I would love some
  No I like children a great
deal
 No Not in my belly Youre borderline
offensive
 Listen everyone this is what happened to me
Here is my definite backstory
 one day
 All right what is it Does it look like good
smoke or bad smoke
 When you say it it has such a different
color to it
 Theyre burning people
 We call that a barbecue

 We could just walk over there Its a hassle
to turn him into a bird
 Yashas leading the way
 The cat
 Yeah do it
 Nothing
 Great Can we stay the night there
 For all of us or just you
 I would like that
LAURA Okay
 We will
 But you cant see in the dark
 Oh yeah
 I will aid
 Hmm what
 What is it
 Which direction Point to it
 Oh shit Are they all on one Do I see
anything
 Or a health cure arrow
 Never going to happen
 Anyway Caleb this is what happened to me
as Oh no
 You said goblinlike creatures
 Nice improv
 Youre asleep though
 Oh wait I never said mine  Sorry
 Wait whatd you have Molly
 Okay
 Miss
 Oh thats right from the first shot
 Take it
 Car face
 I yell to Caleb
 Modern Literature Then I
run towards these two goblins over here
 Yep
 I take out my hand crossbow and I point it
from the goblins to Caleb and I fire
 Im aiming for the book strapped under his
armpit that only I know is under his clothes and
I rolled a natural 
 Hes going to play dead
 Modern Literature
 That was my bonus action For my action I
will tell the two goblins
 Now I have a bonus action
 Can I use it to talk
 Okay so in Goblin Im going to say to them

Ill hold them off You get the loot with the
horses
 Its in Goblin
 
 Wait this is persuasion or deception
 
 No Dont save him
 Youre blowing it
 I should have told everyone the names of all
the set plays
 
 Like real or like seethrough
 Are they real or are they seethrough
 Wolves Where are the wolves
 Youre strong
 You got to close out of that to see the
  Booming Blade
 Yeah Mollymauk
 What did you attack
 Full amplify
 Okay Ill hold up the hand crossbow point
finish the job sister I will fire at the ogre
 Oh no Only a  oh wait no it went up

 Yeah I think I get all the sneak attack
 Ugh
  plus Fury of the Small 
 All right
 Yes Ill say
 Shit I missed Let me try
again Ill reload and Ill go pop and shoot the
goblin right next to me
 Oh no I missed
 I have movement but if I move away no
Ill just stick
 Spiritual Weap
 But shes raging
 By the way Matt last round I should have
done  points of damage not  because Im level
five now
 Matts falling apart
 How will the writers communicate with him
 Without those well see his feminine wrists

 Jesus
  points against who
 Oh shit
 Do I get a
 Oh Sure
 I mean I cant use my crossbow as a melee
no
 Can I do a hand punch
 
 
 Strength bonus
 Oh 
 My unarmed strike says plus three to hit for
some reason I have no idea why
 Zero
 Hes going down
 Take it as a pet
 Oh Im going to turn and chase the goblin
that ran away from me
 Mmhmm
 How far away is he
 Okay Well with  feet I will take a
shot
 Okay
 Thats a something
 Okay Just one right
 Seven points of damage
 He had seven from the magic missile
 Plus a one point punch
 Cool I cant see the other one that went
towards the horses right
 All right Im going to use my bonus action
to dash closer to the body to see if I can
recognize this goblin
 Some people have sleep apnea
 Oh shit
 Did I look at the goblins
 Over  
 Do I find anything interesting on the body
 Of toxin Can I grab those
 Ive got them
 All right Im going to rejoin the group
 I did not No this is not my clan at all
Which is not surprising since we operated not in
this area
 No we did not Ive heard of goblins hanging
out with ogres before and I dont think theyre
too dissimilar But we didnt
 I think so
 It was very rewarding
 Yes Im only sad that one got away
 What do you mean
 Do I hate myself No Im cool I mean she
had wings so you want to talk about that
instead
 Well I know that Im a goblin For as long
as Ive been alive I havent felt comfortable in
my skin for as long as I can remember I just feel
like I shouldnt be I dont fit in with them
Its not just that This feels wrong like I
should be in a different body The way they act
and the way they are Its just not me They do
horrible things to people and they seem fine with
it but I dont know I never felt the same as
them Its not that I dont like myself or
anything I think Im okay But I just dont like
how I feel when I see my hands or my feet They
just feel wrong I want to be different
 Not in my clan no But there was someone I
think I was telling you before that they give you
a job as soon as youre able to do one They tried
me on so many different jobs But I was not a
soldier I was not a good cook I wasnt good at
sewing or building So they stuck me with the
torturer
 I wasnt the torturer I was the torturers
assistant
 No I saw a lot of things and there was a
halfling village not far away They captured
someone from the village and they wanted me to
kill him But instead I was kind to him and he
started talking My fellow gobbies didnt like
that but they allowed it because I was getting
valuable information about where the halflings
kept their food and where they went to harvest
and where we could attack them But I became
friends with him He was nice
 Well I hope he got away
 We left together
 Its not important He was just a nice man
 I dont know He was a chemist so he taught
me about alchemy and liquids and potions and
things And he taught me his language When he had
taught me everything he could they said to kill
him But I didnt want to so I got real drunk
and I created a distraction and I hope he got
away
 I shot one of my fellow goblins in the butt
 He yelled a lot Then we ran off in separate
directions and Ive been running ever since
 I assume back to his village
 Yes I know but I dont know I cant go to
that village Ill be stoned to death
 Im a goblin
 You could maybe go
 I mean were going the opposite direction
 I dont know if we should go back Theres
too many bad people around there What if I run
into the tribe What if someone from the village
sees me They hate goblins
 Yeah that was freaky deaky
 I know
 Yes
 Im okay for now just getting away from them
has been wonderful And Ive met you Caleb and
you dont seem to care how I look or who I was
 Well
 Lets just call it a hyphen for now
 And maybe well move to an ellipsis or
something
 Thats okay I havent eaten any children I
have no desire to eat children But Ive seen
children being eaten and goblins are awful
Theyre terrible in every way If youre not good
they cut you or kill you or throw you away
 As fast as I could
 Being me I think I was probably stealing
some food or something
 All right it was booze
 But you know theyre not wrong right The
people who arrested me are not incorrect If you
see a goblin you should kill it on sight
 Yes
 Absolutely not None of them are
 I have never met another nice one Ever And
I really tried
 No
 It feels like I was in a very average tribe
 That would be fine for them but like I said
this is not me I dont want to be this
 Im never going to be cool with this Ever
 Too much water
 Are we on Whats going on
 Sure lets do that
 Thank you Caleb
I tasted a baby once just once I didnt 
know they were handing around a
bowl I didnt know what was in it and then later
somebody said there was like I mean they put a
bunch of different meat in there How was I
supposed to know that it was like a goulashy thing
 Good night
 Oh no you have a thing
 Did I miss that in the announcements
 Six more battles before we get there
 And we leveled up
 Of course I do
 Sure heres my flask
 Well I cant see inside it so I dont know
But Im sure theres some sort experiment we
could do to Its all right you can have as much
as you want Its endless
 No I mean I rarely did anyway I stole it
but now I dont have to do that either
 Yeah I think its about twothirds full most
of the time
 Sure
 I decided the first time and thats what it
is always
 Why would I get sick of it Its wonderful
 Yes it replenishes with my favorite kind of
whiskey
 The kind that gets you good and drunk
 I could try
 I think its a good experiment
 They already started it
 Lets just see what happens Ill drink a
bunch
 Did it get lower
  I dont want to waste it
  I guess I could Should I throw up
now
 Stick something down my throat
  Did it work
 No not really
 A little sticky
 Yeah
 I think four
 Nine
 But two are always gone
 Youre our strategy guy right
 Okay
 Thats not good Could we make that tapestry
into coats
 Like Teen Wolf
 Thats terrible
 And continue or stop
 Oh yeah
 Should we hide
 Can you try it on the wheel
 Lets just do it Lets see what happens
 Yes you are
 Wait we have two broken wheels
 We could pull the cart off the road if Yasha
picks it up and runs along with it
 In the swamp
 Are there any woods or anywhere to hide
 Im going to go in the grass
  Am I still drunk Do I need to
 Do either of them have saddlebags
 Can I do a little Mage Handy A little
fishing in the one thats closest to me
 
 I hold on to it Can I peek inside

button collection I used to collect stamps I
used to collect different kinds of vials of
different sorts of fluids and things like that I
collect soles of shoes Not shoes just the
soles
 Yeah they come in many different shapes and
sizes The cobblers throw them away when theyre
bad You can fish them out of the trash and you
can have a whole bunch of them
 Nothing I mean you can play a little drum
thing with them
 Sure if you string them together they make
a Roman gladiator belt sort of a thing
 Ooh I could be a little bit taller I think
if you put two on top of each other and push them
in it looks like lips are talking
 I feel like weve gotten to know each other
so well
 Yes under your gigantic arm thank you
 Happens every time it rains
 Lets take the whole fucking tree
 A magical shelter
 You need more paper
 Caleb can do it if he sets his mind to it
 Are we waiting here for a while

 Okay Ooh Two plus something so its nine
 Im sorry Caleb I failed you

 Five more points of damage

 They always fight for the check
 Youre building a stage for something Is
there some sort of circus in town

 Youre the worst
 

 A soft 

 Oh boy
 Theres four rooms
 one of them is Yasha and
the weirdo
 Okay As we go into our room I say to Caleb

Its not really haunted is it
 Have him take care of it Well we know
whats in it Theres inventory so if anythings
missing its on him Its on Dent
 The only thing on the cart is your thing that
you bought at the festival and some crocodile skins
 That is true
 

 Well thank you You know I dont want to
burden you with my shit Youve got your own fish
to fry and your own battles to wage and I dont
want you to have to worry about me or anything
That means a lot to me and oh hello
 Thats the point
 I just want you to be okay It sounds like
this person who corrupted you is out there still
and we need to find him and you know kill him or
whatever If thats something that you want to do
Im fine focusing on that Ive got my own issues
but Im fine taking care of yours first The thing
is your story that you poured out to me and
Beau the other day it was very sad and Im so
sorry that you had to go through it but I have to
say in a way Im a little bit jealous Because
youve done this horrible thing not to make
light of it or anything but its bad and we can
all tell that youre wearing it in your dirty
clothes and your mussed hair
 Well I know but still You know when
youre dirty and it rains and it streaks down and
dries Thats the sort of thing youve got going
on right now
 But youve got a lot of dirt on you
 No All Im saying is I feel like you can
get revenge You can maybe even get redemption for
what youve done and you can become a better
person You can do good to counteract the bad that
youve done in your past and maybe someday there
will be an end to your suffering
 All right Thank you for the offer Good
night Caleb
 Oh god
 
 You filled that whole thing
 We havent used it yet
 Ill take it
 Playing the kenku
  But only if he
does an American accent
  Im from
California
 Its like an EasyBake Oven
 Should we see if the oh no The horses
were taken
 Weve been hired by creepy people but not
by Oh so Im wearing a mask but that is a
different kind of mask Its not a dragon mask
 Shes doing you
 Yes hes my dad

father would want to know whats the item
 Like a bowl or a bowl
couldnt get a lot of soup in a bowl like that
big I mean a big bowl
 Afterschool activities
Its really nice to see to be honest
 I tell him everything
between family
 Which is not a good answer
 Only  more minutes until breakfast is
ready
 Can you do that again Kiri
 Have we ever heard this sound before
 Youve never fought
learned magic I know a few spells and I learned
how to control it a bit Draconic blood gives me
some magic but Ive never been in a real fight
before
 Caleb can teach you all about magic he knows
all the spells and hes very wise
 Yes
 Bren
 I love trinkets
little magic to it
 They are They always have been
 Oh Illustrated

 Sure Papa May I have my allowance now
 He is but fair
 Hes only got one eye he cant possibly see
whats going on
 Im going to use my ring of water walking

Caleb
 Nope all clear
 Yeah
 Its clammy
 We always move at a medium pace
 Nice hes dead
 Hold on Were not done
 Keeping watch
 What do you mean
 Which side
 Theres nothing over here on my side
we should just carry on as normal
 How do you know that
 Shut up Jester
 Are you going to stay behind
 Who Oh me yes Thank you
 Stealthy though
 Should we create a distraction for it first
 Youre a cultist
 Cultish
 You could heal him and curry favor with him
 What if we set a trap or an ambush for him or
her
 We could do a little circleypoo and put Cali
in the middle as bait and then when it comes to
attack we spring the trap
 I dont know Ive been drinking a lot
 Someone walks up to it while the others flank
around
 Ill take Kiri give me Kiri Come here
little Kiri My father wont hurt you anymore
disappointed in you Mr Fjord
 Its not an ambush if they can see where we
are
 That you know of
 Yep on my way
 You can do that
 That sounds like a great idea
 Oh thats my job
 Anyone whos dead or just one dead person
 Which body is fresher Matthew
 Let me check for traps on the smaller one
 Oh a lot 
 Ten
 Does her face look like
 Yeah we dont know this person right
 Would you like to talk to this one
 Well let me introduce you
 This is my friend Jester
 Jester this is a dead body
 Just be confident
 I dont think you have to talk like youre
dead
 Ive never done it you know more about this
than me
 Where When
 How many questions do you get
  Ooh
 One more question
 Either where this happened or where they were
hiding
 Or we could ask if theres a secret entrance
to the safe house
 Then weve wasted a question
 That would be an interesting story Im going
to check behind us and see how far back Fermaw
whats his name Febron
 How far back has Febron gone
 Hey Febron Dont go too far Theres a
troll back there
 I miss I got a nine
 Yes
 No we gave it to him already
 I fired a shot that missed
 A nine
 
 No I got them
 All words Ive never heard before
 Ill get within  feet Fire a crossbow shot
towards its foot
 Thats good
 It hits probably 
 Sneak attack No
 Oh terrible Five points
 Ill shoot again with bonus action Ooh
thats not as good 
 Ill use the rest of my movement to duck
behind a tree or something while I scream
 What Way to go Meester Fjord
 We have to stop it with magic or nets
 Beau dies
 No
 Caleb
 Pus flew out of it
 Aw Kiri
 Okay everythings fine now
 Im up Okay is there anything in melee
range with it No
 Ill move within  feet
 Thats as close as I can get
 I dont know that were letting it go so Im
going to cast Tashas Hideous Laughter on it
Throw out a little piece of pastry and Ill yell
Croakaine

 Theyre not winners guys
 Its a 
 Ill use my extra action to attack
 This is an extra attack action
 I rolled a  plus seven 
 Because its prone do I get advantage or
anything
 Oh natural  so it still hits  But do
I get sneak attack No Because its prone no
 Oh look its a ten to hit
 I mean ten points of damage
 I dont get a bonus action off of that
attack
 Okay Ill fire again Natural  and a 
just a straight 
 Another seven points of damage
 Let me see at the end of each of its turns
or each time it takes damage a target can make a
wisdom saving throw
 Target has advantage on that save if its
triggered by that damage
 Nice Right good to know
  Get the fuck out of here
 Sure Ill take a shot
 At disadvantage
 
 Ive got one more hasted action
 Terrible 
 Okay and a bonus attack action 
 Hey thats one
 Eight points of damage
 We know where he lives
 We have one more question
 Will you let our friend down
 This is the gate of the safe house
 Specific directions
 I can see it its right there
 Give me the charm
 Yes
 I dont check if its magic
 Can I look at the words
 Shadycreek
 Just real quick I wanted to give a quick
shoutout to my brotherinlaw Peter Habib of Mr
Fantastic Music They did the track for the
animated thing
  I love it
 Caleb also likes to burn his friends
 Should we scan for traps
 
 No go ahead
 Like a tea set
 What queen
Shes the Queen of Dragons Five draconic heads
represent her and that kind of thing
 So not a real queen
just always heard to her referred to as the
Queen
 I feel like Caleb could have done it
 Hes being modest He could do it
 Bren
 Well what if something grabs me from under
the surface
 All right Ill walk around
 Sure
see if theres anything that could grab you
 Oh
 Whats up there
 Whats up there
 How far up
 Ill just reach it with my Mage Hand
 Yeah
 All right
 Its just a scarf
 You want me to pull on the branch
 Ill pull on that branch
 Vigorously pull on it
 Huh
 
 All right
 I will check for traps
  
 Great
 You did it
 But you did it
 With my help
 That was Calebs fault
 Yeah Caleb can do light too its not the
greatest
 Ive got to go down there
 That would help
 Gross
 Wait Im just going to take a quick minute
to stare into the eternal abyss of the dodecahedron
 Oh my god what is in there

this one where I would get sneak attack
 I will attack with a crossbow bolt 
 Okay Ooh thats all terrible
 
 Shit Can I use my bonus action to fire the
other one Why not
 
 Thats six points of damage
 No I will stay there and huddle closer to
Mollymauk Did you step out

 Okay

Fjords hand

bracelet
 Over shit
 But theres fish men and possibly fish women
right down there that could come out and kill us
in our sleep
 What if theres unlimited numbers of them
What if theres a whole
 You only saw like five Did you keep going
down into the tunnels
 Were just going to gloss over the fact that
Fjord has three bird nicknames
 That does not sound good
 Its like a sound board
 Wait if you get really excited you should
go 
 Are we going to sleep
 For today
 I did not Oh I did We have to save it for
tomorrow
 Second as well
 Thats a four
 High roll

its just a dream
 We should wake everyone up
 Fjord 
 Dont wake up Kiri though She deserves a
really nice nights sleep
 Im going to give her my blanket
 I remember saying that we should hide the
corpses and Cali actually said Dont do it
theres no point to it So we should blame Cali
 Thats what Cali said
 Why dont we just blow up the hole
 Why do we want to go down there Theres
crazy people down there
 You could just say Be quiet
 Thank you
 We woke her up though but it was cute
 Is our rope still dangling down the hole
 If it comes up should we grab it
 I fired and missed with a natural one
 Youre going down there
 By yourselves
 Take good care of him
 He cant make it without you
 He will not come back alive
 He will have no chance of survival Okay
 Im going to cast Message Are you still
alive You can reply to this message
 Oh yeah While Yashas waiting she can
clean up the bodies You can reply to this message

 Ill stay with Kiri and if theres trouble

 Shes got like  more points
 This is your thing you are strong
 So youre rerolling for him
 Youre great at jumping over small bodies of
liquid Marisha
 Youre super fast Remember youre super
fast
 See Kiri I think they would have called if

Thats my turn

 Refresh

 We solved it
 Just like his dreams

 You know Caleb I never told you this
before but when we met that dragon lady Carrie
Kaylie Kali
 Cali Thats a lot of Ks She gave me this
scroll of Invisibility Ive been hanging onto it
but I didnt know if you wanted to look at it and
maybe learn from it or something
 Here here yes I didnt want the others to
see it just in case
 Do you want it Can you learn that now
 Great Also Im so sorry that I got you in
trouble with Beau for the whole bowl incident I
didnt realize that she was going to freak out on
you like that
 You took a walk with her Was that okay Was
it awkward
 I think so too In her weird sort of stoic
way she seems to care about you
 Do you think she was dropped on her head or
something Shes very sort of you know
 You know what I mean 
 Yeah Yeah thats true
 Im very good Yes
 Things are looking up and you know earlier
you said that I could come talk to you whenever I
want and thank you for that That makes me feel
very good Yeza was his name The halfling man
Before Thats all I just wanted to say his name

 Yeah But you got your rock
 All right Lets rock out
 She couldve learned that from anyone Anyone
with a mildly Zemnian accent
 Shut up Shut up Kiri
 Aw what Dont look at Im turning green
 Northeast
 Wait we have to go around Hupperdook
 Theres a ridge line there right Theres
mountains
 Silberquel Ridge
 We would have to have to go around it
 So we have to go around these mountains We
can either go to the east past Hupperdook Because
were going to Nogvurot right up there
 We could go around Hupperdook way or we
could go Rexxentrum way
 Youve been up there havent you Caleb

us
 What goes on in Hupperdook

 Shes got to hold all the diamonds
 Were each going to have a pocket of 
gold
 I will look for diamonds
 Are you talking to the Traveler right now
 Hes extremely smart
 Lets go
 The fact that they cant speak
 I think hes talking to the cat
 No sometimes when he stares at you and
doesnt say anything he is talking to you
though So thats a fair question
 He only can hear the cat but he can feel
you so poke him if you feel
 That would be weird
 Durian
 We also need some warm clothes Winters

 I disguise myself as a gnome go in and buy
warm clothes

Sprinkler
 And kill him
 Im going to fire one crossbow bolt at that

 Do we need to choreograph something
 That sounds adorable
 Its really nice
 Right away

rifling through his pockets
  No 
 Anything other than money
 Who were they
 Not looking for work were just on a job

 They prefer the term toadstools
 I dont know if we can learn that dance
 Lets just work on something simple Were
going to take a moment to work out a couple of
moves in case it comes up Just some basic hand
moves
 Im much shorter than you
 I like it
 Caleb maybe can do some special effects
 Maybe I should sit it out
 A team drinking competition
 Why would she come out of the room
 Ooh They said that they would send someone
to the room right Molly
 Didnt you say that they would send someone
to the room
 Like a babysitter You could pay one of their
women to watch our little Kiri
 Theyre working women we rent them for a
time
 Oh yeah thats true We could get a sturdy
strapping gigolo man to go up there and
watch out for Kiri
 Yes
 She is a wallflower tonight
 Three manhours
 Caleb we may need a third person to join our
dance now
 You cant dance Youre not a dancer
 Are you sure
 I guess we can Beau
 No third It was Kiri first Caleb second
Youre three
 We should rehearse We dont know when were
going to need the dance yet
 This is good You have an opportunity for
later if you choose to use it
 Have you ever been with someone
 Are you sure
 Insight check
 
 Okay He seems to be telling the truth
 With the hooker
 With the hooker
 Okay lets go make the rounds
 The nerdiest raver
 If theres any more of those sparklers or
poppers around
 Steal some
 That is not the Snitch Just because its
gold doesnt mean its a Snitch
 Okay All right thank you
 No I want something more powerful
 Can you make something
 Gulp
 I swoop back into the shadows and mingle
 Sorry that was my fault
 No I
 I should have known I cant talk to people
 Theyre always shitty Its a  accurate
prediction
 By the way Beau thank you for the other
day
 For talking to Caleb through his you know
 Just be sensitive around him I know that
thats not your strong suit but he doesnt deal
well with harsh criticism all the time
 Im used to it
 Tell me something how did you know about
this place
 Yeah how did you know that the gnomes here
get down with the funky fresh rhythm all night
 What job
 Whats a Cobalt Soul
 What kind of a faction of monks
 Are you evil Are you a bad guy
 I dont think so
 But I dont know you seem to know a lot
about a lot of things and sketchy things too
 What was that job I thought you grew up

 What was this about a job Wait little
townsgirl her parents are wine makers now youre
a brutal assassin martial artist who can kill
anything What happened in between those two things
 Yeah right
 Sure
 You No
 Like what What kind of stuff
 You were bootlegging your old mans hooch
 Wow
 Is he a bad person
 So you took matters into your own hands
 And got in trouble and were sent off to
boarding school
 With monks who are librarians and taught you
how to kill with your fists
 Wait this was not by choice You were
abducted by monks
 Oh my gosh
 Are you okay
 Was it hard
 Ive never thought of you as an optimistic
person but thats a very positive way of looking at it
 I would Very much
 Ill just take a little sip in case we have
to do the Hour of Power later
 Wow Thats amazing
 The trick is to not overmix You dont want
to overmix Oh sorry Weve been walking with
your friend Beau
 Time is of the essence He might be with a
lady of the night later tonight You might have to
teach him quickly
 Cram school
 Yeah Tonight when it doesnt matter you
roll great

 Yes Caleb what is it
 Well I think were going to drink first
 I do like to dance

disguising spell before the dance
 All right Ill do that
 Oh because the shadows wont match
 Okay I will But youll keep an eye out in
case anyone
 All right Thank you
 Ill try If you want to join us you could
just point and clap off to the side You dont
have to dance You can be there to like
 You saw the guys who kicked you in the face
They had plannedout moves that were really cool
 All right Well do choreography to the right
and left and you two be in the middle and just freestyle
 What wands The Wand of Smiles
 Thats probably it for the day
 So petty
 Are we all going
 Whos the worst at drinking
 Then maybe you should sit this one out
 Do we want this to be the thing that we find
out on
 Ive never had a drink in my life
 Maybe you can be
 You could be the manager of the team
 Yes You can use your clerical mysticism to
confuse and disrupt our enemy
 All right So Ill wait until theres
 Hes trash talking Dont listen to him
 Maybe we should do our dance to distract his
competitor now
 It was  but 
 Oh no No Caleb no

 I dont think I can do it
 Cut my eyes Cut my eyelids off
 Oh what does that do

 Sorry
 Thank you
 What does this get me
 Guys we can drink more
 Let it be known that The Mighty Nein can take

 You were great out there
 Mollymauk
 Well dance a bit
 Absolutely
 Yes youre way stronger
 Her koi pond
 Sure
 Do we have our money
 Wait all of our money is gone
 I accuse Jester of stealing our money
 Youre right Its stupid
 We as detectives should think clearly about
Did you all have your money after the competition
 Between the competition and bedtime our
money was stolen
 Is Kiri with us
 Kiri did you steal our money
 That cuts down on our detective work a lot
 But it was only the five who competed who
were robbed
 It could be because we won and Blemmys crew
stole our money
 So were going to talk to Irena and then
were going to maybe find Blemmy or maybe just
follow Locate Object
 Im wearing it
 No I only keep my valuable things in other
pockets
 Within how many feet
 Well lets sees if she talks first
 Does she I havent talked to her
 Molly could use his masculine wiles to talk
to
 You have pan wiles
 She did it
 I still think she did it
 Bacon
 Well go check
 Me too
 Ask Irena about the little girl
 Who was here last night
 Irena if Molly was interested would you
like
 No just like
 Nevermind lets go to Rissa
 Dont you guys use scissors when you have sex
with each other
 This is real
 Thats what I was trying to get to Wait us
We have to answer truthfully
 Youre not my type
 I like you Youre nice
 Yes
 Theyre probably not going to use them
Theyre just one drink They would keep
all the hundreds of gold
 One more question
 Irena Where does the pianist live
 Yeah the guy playing the piano
 Whats his name We never asked
 Already Were not there yet Now Okay
 Makes sense
 Lets run
 Kiris our little daughter shes a bird

 What the fuck was that
 Am I allowed to rob him
 Or get it back for you
 What would you do if you had the thing back
or
 Its okay Calm down
 Cleff you know you seem to have a fine eye
and talent for mechanical devices
 Do you ever have any need of alchemical
combinations with your mechanical devices
 I think I have a little oil if you need it
As a sign of good faith Didnt we get oil at some point
 Wait Oh wait no I have holy water That
is not the same thing
 All right
 Shes working for us

by the way

 By the way ice sailor sounds like the
coolest job What does that even mean
 Mixed with Ice Road Truckers
 What Whats wrong
 You feel bad

 Should I shoot them down while they run
 Everyone Everywhere
 On the way out can I just ask that gentleman

Do you make any of those things that weve seen
around here
  The pistols Do you make those
here
 Oh Thank you Good day
 The Iron Lot
 Our list of suspects is as follows
 The pianist Blemmy Rissa The girl
 Fitz and Ashton Weve eliminated as possible
lame The pianist
 Because you did Locate Object within his
 Rissa Because she was in Zone of Truth
 That leaves our suspects Blemmy And the
girl
 But She has your copper pieces
 You did Could you find those specific
silver pieces Or the money she stole from us
 So we go find Blemmy
 Silver Falls Thats the residential area
Where the finger towers apartments are
 Silver Falls
Bells Silver Falls
 Lets go
 Will you be able to cast it again
 Why did you
 Just while we stroll through the town
 Sure I guess What are you searching for
 Follow her Shes a bloodhound
 Was it Blemmy
 They all had nasty beards Duncan Valkin
Ruth and Tanya
 The first guy was Duncan Valkin was the next
guy
 Oh were going to circle around
 No wait Can we surround it first Jesus
 We surround the building
 I will take out my wire and
 I whisper to Beau using Message What do you
see You can reply to this message
 No
 We dont know what youre doing
 Should we draw them out
 Were just going to bust in What if they
have traps and bombs
 I will kill them all
 You went down a chimney
 What god were they worshiping
 Its very clear We have Kiri already We
take these four children with us and we keep going
 But we still have weeks left dont we
 You have a means of contacting The Gentleman
You could ask for a threeday extension
 Caleb you have a photographic memory as you
remind us every session How long do we have until
our time is up with The Gentleman
 How long would it take do we think to get up
north there if we went straight A week
 So weve got a couple weeks We have a day
or two to spend on some prison breaking
 Beauregard dont you think they should be
reunited with their father who loves them very
much and wants to be with them
 And take them to an orphanage
 It would be horrible if they were taken away
from their home and given to some people who would
do horrible things to them or mistreat them for
their whole childhoods leaving them as cold
heartless resting bitches
 That was an intimidation tactic I would
never hurt a child
 No I wouldnt I love children
 That was an accident
 Were you an orphan
 Were you an orphan
 Sorry
 Eight hours right
 I have some human jerky left over
 Well we know how much the prostitutes cost
to watch Kiri
 The children do owe us a little bit
 Oh Schusters
 Oh yeah Going to lean those up against the
door jamb
 Well do recon for the afternoon and then
well attack tomorrow morning
 Unless this guy comes in the next week
 If that happens
 You said late morning Midday So we could at
least go check out this prison and do some
scouting before nightfall yeah
 Oh the teenagers
 Yeah you just had a baby I understand
 Rissa knows the town though she might be
able to help us scout out this prison
 Why dont we have Fjord and Jester go tell
their employers
 Which one are you Are you Jester
 Oh yes Well lets find out if we need it
yet
 I guess were all going
 All right
 Lowerdook
 Fuck those guys Theyll be fine
 How would they find the kids
 Hmm
 We did
 Oh yes You have that spell dont you
 To Fitz and Ashton
 To Fitz
 You have like eight words left
 Go back to work
 Thats true A lot of that was hyphenated
 And the stuff theyre making is catapults or
guns
 Cool
 Whats that place called again
 Is it heavily protected
 It just rolls and cuts
 Its inside of it I would assume right
 What did your father call this robit
 The Gearkeeper
 Would anyone believe that
 Not by the city
 Hmm
 Well the main concern is getting in the
prison I dont know if walking up to the front
door and saying Hi were here to take care of
your spinny death problem is going to work
 Do we need outfits or something
 What like Orkin man outfits or do we need
to look like were official
 But they dont like her father
 Heisttype maintenance workers uniforms
 I just want to wear a onesie
 Ooh That sounds like something thats way
too smart for Laura to say
 I love a pie
 Why You playing five characters at the same
time
 Wed like a hospitable meat pie
 Oh
 We have money again dont we
 When the whistles blew Matthew did we see
any guards do a shift change at the prison
 Seven
 Oh
 Okay
 Oh yes
 Weve brought gift
 We could steal the crossbow We dont have to
do the mission at all
 I could just saying
 Is that a cymbal crashing
 Shes clever
 No Shes a wily one
 Hes eating that extra meat pie
 Gnome
 Just wait it out
 You are fucking crazy Cleff
 Or maybe Yasha could hit it with her sword
 Question Can it climb
 Cleff when you were building this thing you
were building it offsite I assume right
 No I mean off the prison site not
 So you dont know any extra secret entrances
or exits to the prison itself
 Thats enough to smear a lens
 I could put a meat pie on the end of one of
my bolts and shoot it at it
 Or just tar or something
 Maybe on the walk we can see if we can find
a tar restaurant
 In a bucket
 It has to be a little hot
 Hey you could heat up a bucket of tar as we
walk into a prison That wouldnt be suspicious at all
 This is the worst night ever
 No Im committed
 Ive got two spares if I need it
 Lets go
 Do you need a drink to soothe your nerves
 But it would really help
 In a smothering way
 Were just going to walk up to the guards and
say were here to dismantle the robit right
 All right lets do it Whos going to be
doing the talking
 Yeah Yeah no I think Fjord would agree
with that
 Tar first Where do we go for tar the Iron
Lot
 Ill look for that
 
 And were behind a gate And theres
workers everywhere
 This is at the Assembly Yard
 Ah why would you no
 We could just walk in and pretend to be a
worker and just grab a bucket
 We could just sneak in the gate
 Whats his range
 How far is it Matt
 Ten minutes Oh okay
 Ill walk around and see if theres a way
through the gate thats hidden
 Ten
 Okay lets see if Schmidt can
 Juggle something
 Wait youre going to jump the fence No
this is a distraction Youre not supposed to jump
in the
 Oh god
 When Schmidt comes close enough yes
 It could go now but we cant go fast
theyll see a moving bucket
 Okay Ill cast Mage Hand
 Are people looking right now
 Okay
 Im just going to wait until they finish
their conversation
 As he starts walking Ill nod to Caleb and
try to do the lift over the fence
 Sleight of hand 
 Yeah
 We have a bucket of tar Part one of our plan
is complete
 Look at that teamwork
 Yeah everybody contributed a little Except
for Jester and Fjord everyone was really good
 Lets put the tar bucket in the haversack of
holding if thats possible If it will fit
 I dont know
 Then were carrying a bucket of tar Is that
weird
 All right Well just carry it
 Yeah Persuasive Beau
 How many doors are there
 Were doing this now
 If Im going to be throwing tar at this
thing maybe I should have it
 I could
 All right So the guards will take us down
 She cant Shes out of spells
 Didnt we use a bunch
 Those are highlevel spells
 Okay Does it say how many spells she has
left
 Oh it reset but she definitely had used
some
 In case this all goes titsup do we want to
try to talk to these guards and maybe figure out
what cell the Schusters are in
 Im not talking to them But someone with
more charisma than me
 Oh Charming Caleb
 I mean is that worth doing now
 No but I mean if the warden doesnt give us
what we want
 Okay But were in the prison
 All right
 Okay
 Yeah sure
 Im going to look at the
 the dodecahedron while were at it
 Lift
 Oh sure
 Okay Ill use Mage Hand to hold it up
 Yeah Ill hold it with my Mage Hand
 Ah Oh but we were about to fight
 Thats not good
 Sure Ill sneak over to the door and try to
unlock it
 Or see if its locked
 Ill pick a lock
 Thats is a 
 Four
 I dont know whats in it I cant see
anything through it can I
 Whats in that room
 What an amazing mini
 Thats rough
 If the thing comes out here were all dead so
we should probably figure out a way to stop it
 All right but I cant open it
 Does the door have holes
 Thats not a door its just a cage
 Thats pretty good Lets move quickly
though
 If we went inside that room though
 The creature would probably give up and go
back into hiding until we came out I would assume
 Sure
 Thats scary and dangerous
 Its a terrible idea but go for it
 Does Jester have her Spiritual Weapon out
 Okay Maybe we should get it ready
 Wait what
 We can make some right now
 Quietly
 All right well plan B
 Do you want me to scout ahead to the area
that youve seen
 Or the cat yes How about the cat goes to
the area where Molly has seen Which Liam for
you is the bottom left of the picture I sent
you
 No this is the one that
 The first explored room that Molly has seen
a little bit of
LIAM Sorry I was looking at my spellbook and not
paying attention to you lot What were you
hoping me to do
 Send the cat
 Im going to recast Mage Hand and pick up
the bucket of tar
 Towards the narrower hallway
 Yeah just on the edge of it Do I hear any
movement or anything
 The room
 Oh god Save 
 Whoa Who are you
 Seven
 Caleb and Jester are six Molly and Nott are
both seven
 This is it
 This is it
 Kick it in the ball
 Clang
 Yeah Fjord
 Plus three from
 The Gearkeeper
 I probably have my crossbow out
 Ill hit it with my crossbow
 Yeah 
 Do I get a point of damage
 Yeah Eat it
 I need a new crossbow is what I need
 It can do that
 Cleff you madman
 Oh rough 
 Because I hit it with my thing do I no
longer have a reaction
 Oh shit
 Is its lens out
 So go for the lens
 Bonus action I will use the Mage Hand to
deliver the tar right on that lens
 There is no bonus to that Well thats how
do you feel about that Well it fell so well
never know what it was 
 Our plan worked perfectly How far am I from
the thing
 Do you think Im in melee range
 Can I use my action to disengage
 Okay I will disengage and run
 Straight to the place I just came from
 Sure
 Ooh nice
 Why cant we hear you
 Simple Sacred Flame
  Were going to do
Guiding Bolt
 That door actually opens and closes Matt
 Up the butt Does it have a butt Matt
 Does it poop
 Everyone poops
 Ooh
 Thats exactly how he talks
 Oh no Not my sweet boy
 
 My mustache is falling off so I better hold
it on with another mustache
 Get up under them plates
 Oh no
 So far weve learned today that Fjord sounds
 Useless
 Im going to scoot around and fire a crossbow
at it
 Thats a  plus seven to hit
 Is it within melee and stuff
 Well that wasnt good at all
 Thats eight
 Ill use my Fury Of The Small Thats another
five points
 Terrible I cant really do anything You
know what Ill take out my last burning bolt
that should be magical load it up and fire that
 But that doesnt hit I just wasted it Its

 Damn it
 What are you talking about
 Im going to duck back a little bit
 Can he use the rest of his movement to work
on his Jester accent
  Technically
 Now
 I dont know can you get in there Is the
guts exposed
 Its pronounced
drawl Hexblades Curse
 Yeah Where Oh no Caleb youre in that
cone
 Oh no hes dead already
  Open the door on your mystery date
Caleb you have to make a dex save
 How Youre pinned to a wall
 Marisha do one for Fjord
 How about you Cay CayCay
 Low okay
 Hows she
 Do that thing you do Beau
 Sure
 I mean I dont have much Ill walk up
there poke around the corner shoot a crossbow
bolt do my thing Thats a big hit 
 Ten halved
 I guess These attacks are so weak I dont
know what else to do I dont have anything else
to do Yeah I guess Ill shoot another one Why
not That hits 
 Thats another six points halved
 Take those shots Mollymauk
 Is it the Snitch
 Where did you get that
 Ecks versus Sever

 Caleb I need you to come open this door
 Yasha I need you to come kick in this door
 Youre bigger
 Youre bigger in spirit and heart
 I believe in you Oh wait
 Im going to use this Matt Im going to try
to bend fate and try to repick the lock
 I know
 Its a lot

 Its 
 Anything near the bodies
 This Im good at One

 Old prison poop
 Should we retrieve the magic core or anything
as proof of what we did here
 Wherever it stays Well lets take this
stuff back up to the warden
  Were done Let us out Guards
 On our way out do I see my bolt anywhere
 
 It only triggers if it hits
 It was an incredible device
 You could have told us the eye had a
protective windshield wiper device
 Poppin Drokrusher
 Its all right
 Lets have a meat pie

 Theyre at your house the butcher place
Dont worry well take you there Theyre being
kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger
 Sometimes the people that help you are the
least expected
 Yes
 Yes well come back and check on Kiri Be a
good girl Kiri
 I guess everyone knows at this point so its
okay now
 Thank you for listening to us
 That felt really good guys
 Its nice being good people
 We can do more things in this city
 Yes thats right I guess we should go visit
Cleff
 Who says its mine It could be any of ours
I mean mines a little busted though so it
would be nice
 I can fix that Probably
 Okay Worth a shot
 Well we just came to say goodbye were
probably rolling out of town soon And you know
I mean if you had an extra crossbow lying
around
 A beta testing sort of a thing
 Mmhmm mmhmm
 Sure
 Okay Yes Ugh
 I love it Its great
 Thank you Thank you Cleff
 Im sure hes going to invent many new
excellent devices
 I think theyre on the road to recovery
 Yes
 Shes not going anywhere What are you
crazy Caleb Shes fine Come on
 Youre crazy
 Its fine
 Is that where were going next
 Are we making our way out of town
 On the way out of town you said when we
came into town there were some guards with
pistols with guns
 Do we see any on the way out
 
 Im going to try to steal it
 With either Mage Hand or my own hand
whatevers
 Mage Hand
 What am I doing Sleight of hand
 Oh  then So not sleight of hand this is
a dexterity check
 Oh well then its 
 Okay
 Great
 Its loaded with a bullet though right
 Okay cool Great Thats all I care about
 You go
 I got a nine
 Oh god
 Whoa
 Shes a bad motherfucker
 Was she taken and Fjord and Jester
 All in the same cart
 We heard it with our passive perception
 Oh I forgot to tell you that I never went to
sleep and I was watching the whole time
 Well yeah blood
 Yeah well get a black light

 Were going to name it Caruso
 Mmhmm
 Thank you Matt for making this game work
with half of a crew
 Im sure theyre sound asleep right now Just
getting a good nights sleep

 The first night is rough
 Come in Harry come in Take off your
robes
 We dont know
 Jester I need some pocket bacon for
breakfast Jester Jester oh shes probably
taking a dump in the woods
 Oh can I have some
 Oh thats even better 
 She does that sometimes Im sure its
nothing
 Thats playing
 Thats playing with fire
 Their personal belongings and stuff
 His spats and spurs
 Oh wow
 Ill take a swig to calm my morning nerves
and start searching around to see if theres any
notes or any signs of anything around
 Okay Thats terrible
 Thats an eight
 Whoa
 Oh my god were not even going to know
theyre gone

 We got a two a two a one What was your
first roll
 Okay so six is our top roll so far
 Can we follow those grooves
 Can we see which direction those wagon tracks
went in
 Survival Nine
 That narrows it down Its not east or west
guys
 God damn it
 Who was on watch It was Fjord and Yasha
right
 So they would have been awake But what about
Jester She was asleep right
 Maybe they werent targeting anyone specific
just coming to grab folks and those were the ones
that were awake or closest to the road or
 Well they took the three ugliest ones I
mean they left us
 Wait Im going to examine the tracks for
blood
 Mmm Thats an 
 Anything weird about the blood Is it green
blood purple blood blue blood
 That means that they werent bleeding when
they were dragged which means that either they
were killed by vampires and all their blood was
sucked out of them first or they were still alive
 Seeing that I will draw my new crossbow
Turn it on I imagine its batterypowered


 Sure
 Ooh
 What Whoa
 How This is terrible here
 So much better than us
 Oh shes challenging us
 Whats going on up there
 Should I kill something
  I think she means Shadycreek Run
 Just one
 Im going to walk up next to Molly
 Should I kill her
 You can come up now Caleb
 
 Why
out My flask is done
 Oh your flask runs out
 
fuck is happening right now
 Sorry
 Hes very weak

 Dont worry Its a cat usually
 Ooh
 I like you already Here do you have a cup
or something I could pour into
 All right Im going to take out my flask and
pour a good healthy half quantity You have to
drink it fast It will disappear soon
 Yes
right Keg knocks it back
 What I am the greatest detective of all
times I poured one drink and I solved the case

nice people as you may have gathered Good thing
you were heading to Shadycreek Run because thats
where they operate out of
 How do you know Who are they
too
 Did you lose someone
 
 Oh I should take off the mask Its more
scary that way 
  Jeff
 Its Nott
Whats your name
 Herr Bush Why dont you come back to our
camp
 No arent we in the road Oh did we come
back
 Oh okay Cool
 Who are they
Murderers Basic pieces of shit Theyre very good
at what they do They are the scariest most
powerful people that Ive probably ever met and
Ive met a lot of people I grew up in Shadycreek
Run
 Why are they operating this far from the
Run Also what kind of slavers These are
powerful people that they just kidnapped
 Okay okay You dont know us
little man
 I gave you a little bourbon Im a lady I
gave you some booze The least you could do is
afford us the benefit of the doubt
 Beau is terrible with relationships and
social interactions
 Do you know any of their names the
Shepherds
 Who are they
some beef as you may have gathered with this
crew Im not interested in just getting your
friends and getting out I want to fucking kill
every single last one of them If you want any
more information from me Im going to need a
little bit of buyin
  gold is expensive Wait so if you could
rescue your friends or friend or whatever
 Are you sure
 So its revenge then
 I just imagined some crazy shit

 Youre confident that you can lead us to
these Shepherds
 How many of them are there
 Hey were five
and a half if were being honest
 Dont put yourself down like that Im sure
you can hold your own
Theres five
 You know when we were in Zadash we heard
the town crier talking about kidnappings in
Nogvurot Thats close to Shadycreek Run Could
that be the same people do you think
doing the same kind of work These folk happen to
be the best at it
 Iron Chef
 Here let me pour you some more booze
 Does that help
the family Theyve got connections there In
fact the folks that the Iron Shepherds work for
happen to hate that family
 This is all connected
 Its like a conspiracy and were in the
middle of it
people say information and then you remark upon
it and then thats you saying youre a great
detective
 In large part The subject was confused as to
what a detective is Im not writing I dont have
a quill Its something that me and one of our
lost friends talked about a lot Sorry
 Well kill these folks or try to anyway
 What if one gets away Were going to hunt
them down over our lifetime I dont know what if
they go far away Are we indebted to you forever
now or can we put a  day cap on this
 Nothing You sure sound like our new leader
 Oh yeah no
 I mean hes got the intelligence
 Are you just walking Do you have any means
of transportation
 We do
 Oh we have a map of some sort Should we lay
it out on the table and see if
 Weights
 Thank you
 But wed have to ditch some gear or do we
have enough horses to carry everything including shields
 Can we carry all of our friends stuff on a
horse We have six horses I think
 Its not
 Its not special to her in any way
 The big things were leaving
 All right
 No we should leave them
 Why dont we kill it and take some meat All
right lets just leave it
you leave a horse around here its probably going
to get killed Theres a lot of shady folks around
here
 I mean the horses are all named after
 Poop So we can probably
 I believe were going to take WC Loo John
Crapper and Toilet but were going to leave Loaf

 Were going to drop a quick Loaf then go
Its always better to drop a Loaf before you go
 Sure
 Skidmark
 Is one of us steering the journey and can
another one of us be looking for clues or things
along the way
 Are you cold
 Swimming in it
 Why are you hiding your face
time I was here So Im trying to keep a low profile
 Do you want to look at the thing the orb
 Okay youre good
 We have to look at the orb at some point too

 But we wont encounter as many foes
 Okay
 Are we trying to avoid people or

 That would be a three
 Im going to try to cut out the tongue Maybe
thats something I can eat later
 Ugh I dont know that
 
 
 Maybe the two smalls should
 What Ive bonded with its essence now
 Ive got the booze
Im willing to sacrifice booze
 Would that work
 Wait we have three yeah okay
 I noticed back there that you were using your
hands and weapon stuff and things Youre not a
healer or anything
 You dont have any potions of healing or
anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone
needing healing would
 No one now but in the future its a
frequent occurrence for us
 Do any of us have any potions
 She had a Greater Healing potion however I
dont know if she had that on her or kept it in
the sack
 I think we have her notebook in the locker
 No I felt around in there
 Did the light just change in here
 The light is moving
 Just stare back
 I have a couple of empty vials but theyre
small Ive worked with chemicals before I could
try to put this acid in the vials and stopper
them
 Sure Would three vials of acid be useful to
us
 Sure all right Ill try to make a little
needle prick in the bladder and try to pour them
into these vials that I got from The Gentleman
 Okay Thats 
 I have three from The Gentleman
 Okay Great Would you like one You did
this
 I dont know how I would put it on there
 Why dont you take one
 Molly do you want some acid Do you want to
drop some acid

 How about Ill give you two and Ill keep
one since I already have one that I made

 One two three
 What the fuck was that Matt There was an
owl that just hooted on the soundtrack
 We were all spooning
 Where
 Is Caleb gone
 No
 Okay I didnt know if he was a phantom or
something
 Of course
 Its a baby
 Maybe you should not go first
 Im going to not follow but go off to the
side and try to go around the other way
 
 Ill slowly emerge from the shadows
 Guys DD Beyond is a wonderful platform in
which you can organize your statistics and your
equipment and theyve just recently done a revamp
of their layout Liam how do you like it
 And its customizable
 Nice
 Yes
 Stop  Bastard
 Ah I forgot you were with us

 Well these people have suffered the same fate
that our frie
along this road

people that have affected them
 Some people are just good
 Related to you

 The subject seems to be exhibiting signs of
distress or at least annoyance
 Its breakfast
 Ill take one Yes thank you
 What does it do
 Do you smoke it
 See People are just nice sometimes
 Yes we should keep going to find their
friends
 Do you know someone named Pumat Sol
 How about one of his friends Pumat Sol or
Pumat Sol or Pumat Sol
 I just thought maybe they knew each other
 I dont know how many of these there are
 Me Im
 No I dont know every goblin Theres lots
of goblins I never All right all right point
taken point taken

 No that was really good
 Not the firbolgs we just met right You were
talking about the people who kidnapped our friends
 I think were still talking about the
people who kidnapped our friends
 Sure sure
trying to help those people while were in Shady Run
 And maybe even complete our mission
 At a fast pace Matthew Im on horseback
with Caleb right Could I be on the back maybe
just flipping through Jesters sketchbook
 Okay Im going to look through the whole
thing
 Is it all drawings Are there any notes or
letters or clues to her past
 Common Goblin Halfling
 Keep it to myself  Keep steering
Caleb Im looking at nudie pictures
 Are we getting close to where you think their
headquarters are
 Lets do it
  total
 Ill take watch with Keg
 
 Chilly Sure glad I have all this booze to
drink to keep me warm Wouldnt you like some
get cold
 Well it tastes good though So theres
that too
 Im not trying to cozy up to you I think we
got off on the wrong small feet
four times
 I have to bare my teeth at everyone Look at
these things theyre huge
 No I have very thin lips very long teeth
some would call them fangs Its not my fault
When I smile it looks like Im trying to bite
your throat off
 
 And I like tongue I was eating some tongue
when you saw me
coming on to me
 No Oh god no
disgusted
 Youre a handsome woman but youre a
woman right
 Okay good Just making sure
doesnt mean Im not a woman
 I dont know I dont want to presume
anything
 All right here you go You know it never
runs out
 No
 Special trick So uh who got took Who are
you missing
friend
 No What I thought we were getting to know
each other
you gave me a little bit of libation
 All right did you go to school
went to school
 Hmm I would say no
 Did you have a happy home life growing up
favorite pastime there is stabbing people No I
didnt have a nice growing up
 Hmm Im trying to think of a topic thats
less charged Do you have a favorite sports team
you like

 Iron Chef I love Iron Chef Never mind
 I just thought well
 No I just thought if we knew more about your
situation it would maybe lead to clues that would
help us track down or know the weaknesses of
these Shepherds who stole or killed your friends
If we knew the circumstances around their untimely
demise
 Were you one of them
 Did you go to high school no you didnt go
to school Hmm everyone else is snoring
them Theres no way to not know them
 All right
as youre trying to siphon information
 Im doing what any good detective does which
is just lay the groundwork for the case
detective
 Jester Jesters one of the folks that got
stolen Together we were a dynamic duo of mystery
solving We could solve any mystery Find any
criminal mastermind no matter how nefarious We
had all the tools all the insights all the
instincts It was amazing We were a well oiled
machine and then she was taken And now its
just me
this duo
 I resent that
Im going to try to help get her back
 All right Well Ill try to help you get
revenge on your vague past

just not much of a sharer
 Sure sure How about you tell me one fact
about you and Ill tell you one about me
 Something you havent told anyone Itll be
like a game And well each take a shot
 Here you go 
by them By the Shepherds So
 Im a pretty good dancer
shit
 I didnt know
questions Youre going to fucking give me the
dancer shit
 I didnt know I thought we were going to
start small and then build
a serious question and then you gave me the shot
 You gave me the heaviest shit first though
 Of course
 Well this has been fun
 Its got five wheels
 Caleb should I go check them out
 Oh okay
 Are they suspicious
 All right We can go
 Caleb look at this picture of you in
Jesters book Its really funny
 Oh no
 Theyre moving right
 We dont even know who they are yet though
 We love our guests We love them
names Lorenzo Hes a human This is weird Ruzza
the halfelf sorcerer Protto shitty little
halfling rogue Dwelma is a halforc druid woman
How much more do I have to tell
 I definitely deduced that from our
conversation Its not surprising to me in the least
 I lied too Im an average dancer

 Want some more booze
 We told you that
 We said that multiple times
 Yeah how Can you go owl it out
 Yeah he usually narrates as he sees
 Sometimes you do
 Why not Theres five of us and
 We have an owl
 At night maybe after theyve camped
 Or a fortress or something
 Should we just continue to follow them for
now or attack right now in the broad daylight
two days
 Oh We know where theyre going We know
where they are Why dont we ride ahead of them
 Yes
 Thank you Id better get drunk then
 On the same road Were not even going to go
around
 Youre gross Marisha
 Why dont you look at that dodec
 Wow mines 
 
 Maybe
 This ones aroused who knows whats going to
happen

 Oh interesting
 Well we would want them to get going in the
morning right But not immediately get ambushed
like settle into a little bit of a pace for an
hour or two
 Yeah somewhere around there A couple
miles
 Yeah thats the key
 Oh its dark now right
 Ooh
 We need to plan the ambush
 We dont have a cart to block the road with
Person
 What do we have
with these motherfuckers Skeletons in the
closet
 You could stand in the middle of the road and
distract them
 What if we did like a
 like a Red Dawn thing  We dug a
hole and then we got in the hole
 and they came over us and we popped out of
the hole and we grabbed onto the cart and we rode
under it and then we like chopped a hole in the
bottom of the cart
 It would be really cool
 Oh  No
 Lets figure out what we do have though
 We have four vials of acid
 Oh We could just kill all the horses
 We could just ambush the last one
 Do you have anything we could use
javelins
 we guys
 Youre part of the team now too
craziest shes the halforc
 Druid
all pretty awful to be honest
 Whats our primary goal Just to stop them
and prevent them from fleeing
them
 Yes so we have to stop the path right We
have to block them from escape How do we do that
Do we fell a tree Can we fell a tree
 We could fell the tree right on them as they
come by
 Kill all the horses first so they cant get
away
 Ooh thats pretty good I could also Mage
Hand and start unlocking cages
somehow
 Okay How do you propose
of them occupied
 If were trying to split them up you could
just slow the last carriage further down the road
and theyd drift apart a bit I dont know
 I see
 Do we have any other weapons or any other
special things
 I have a gun

 I stole a gun in the last town we were in I
stole a gun I have a gun
 No youre not going to take the gun
 No youre not
 Ill take acrobatics Its only 
 I dont know
probably going to die guys
 Sure sure
 First of all Im not good at finding traps
but Ive found a few and the ones Ive found have
been rope based
 I could do a tripwire for the horses
 Okay so we fell a tree in front of the road
They stop to move it Im in there unlocking things
 Theyve already stopped though
 Sure sure
 Keg goes in to distract Caleb kills the
horses
 Yes of course
  This is a great plan The winning
part especially Amazing

 Are you aroused
 Ah help Im under a tree Also you hate
me
 Im going to dig a hole just in case This
Red Dawn thing
 Sure On the tops of the hills and then one
for me right in the middle of the road under the earth
were they to reach Shadycreek Run If they would
disband at any point if they would stick
together where they would take
 Yes absolutely Lets do it
 Crafting party
 But you cant know the map because we just
came up with this ambush plan tonight Theres no
way that you would have foreseen something like
this happening
 Can he float
 Day
 I wasnt
 We have a green room
 Oh the makeup room
 Are we going to do a studio tour at some
point
 You know one of the things about the makeup
room is it has those hair salon sinks where you can get
a haircut in it or get your hair washed in the sink
 Can I get my hair washed in one of those
 Can we move some of those bushes up Up on
top of the hill Can we snap some twigs and make
the bushes bigger
 Yeah fluff the bushes a little bit
 Yeah lets do that
 Oh my god Were Minecrafting
 About there
 And were going to do that over here a little
bit
 This thing cant move right
 Holy shit
 Its like Rocky IV
 in the middle or should we Im aroused
Sam Riegel is
 Should we put it here to narrow the passage
 Okay
 Is this thing hollow at all
 Thats where Ill hide Tomorrow
 Caleb any other terraforming we want to do
over here
 Are we
 We added some bush up here and up here to
hide in so then one person can hide here one
person can maybe hide here
 We moved this over and its got a little nook
in it so Nott can stay in there
 But we have this tree here Do we want to
knock over that tree and block the path
 How tall is this tree Matt
 So it only
 How about this If I may This log that weve
set on this side what if we set it on this side
over here
 and then we weaken the tree in case we need
to tip it over
 and block the other half
to okay great
 So now we can weaken this tree maybe with
some chops and then
 it can block the other half
 Sure
 To controlled
powerful
 Interesting
 Do we want to do any digging Any mudding
Anything else Is this our ambush
 Me
 Im going to be in the log someones going
to be up here in bush one someones going to be
in bush two
 Someone will be behind the tree
 Caleb where are you going to be
 Wait I thought Caleb was the Bush Man

 Just dry run it here dry run it
 Okay The carts coming it gets slowed Oh
what the fucks going on
 Then Slow it But it doesnt stop it just
slows
 So right here it slows Theyre like What
the fucks going on
cart right
 Theyre already past us then Well stop
them
 Yeah
 Or we do this we slow them or whatever and
then
 Then they get here Oh crack Or maybe we
stop them first crash stop everything stops
then we hit them with Slow
 Oh fuck
deeper in and we can attack them right
 So should we let one cart go first and
then
 On the first cart
 So the first thing that happens is the trunk
the tree
 The second thing that happens is Slow The
third thing that happens is I pop out of the tree trunk
 Which cart are they going to be on
 Which should I start with The small one or a
big one
 Did I give you a scroll of Invisibility
 Could you use it on me Or would that ruin
your books
 An hour
 Meters
 Im not going to attack Im just going to
jump on a cart in the fracas and try to find a
cage or two
 On people On magic users
 Can you
 Thats my voice Ashly
 Up there in bush land are you going to be
able to do anything
 But that would get you on the cart with the
bad guys You cant just rain down terror from above
attacks
 Im ranged
 Well huddle together
 Whos Lucky Pierre Whos in the middle
 Theyre already here
 I look in
 Before we go Im going to whisper to Caleb

Caleb if anything goes shitty Im going to throw
my flask of oil on the first cart Light it on
fire
 Clarota
 Oh shit Im so scared
 Hold me Ashly
 Come on Keg
 How did you have that

 
 Ah Is that cocked I cant tell if thats
cocked I need a ruling from oh it fell
 
 Hey dont leave We might be ending now
 Were starting this I dont know how Im
going to get on this fucking cart How am I going to
get on this cart Im not invisible
 All right Ill run past Lorenzo As I run I
will dump all my oil on him
 Yep thats my action
 Bonus action disengage
 And jump into the cart and start doing this
 Yeah
 Oh shit
 Theyre invisible cages
 The part of me that hit the cage is now
invisible also
 Thats all Ive got
 Im sure I pushed as far as I could
 Come on this is what you live for
 Youve got ball bearings
 Its a perfect plan
 Its now or never
 Ki questions
 Wow Slow is the best
 Not a sorcerer You got it wrong
 The cover of bush
 Yeah we had him all bushed
 Hell resist it
 Yes
 Come on motherfucker
 Wow we stumped him
 The only good plan that weve ever made is
without Travis and Laura here Lets make that clear
 Are you doing a throwback right now
 Oh no
 He can cast I thought you said he was a
fighter Your information is the worst
 Rogues are the worst
 Oh
 Oh that wasnt damage I thought that was
damage okay
 Oh you ditched Thats fine
 Yeah theres  players
 Which one
 Do the horses get an attack of opportunity
 Were still alive
 All right Keg Kill them all in one turn
From  feet away
pretty freaked right now Is it weird to ever give
yourself disadvantage on things narratively
 He is covered in oil which makes him kind of
sexy
 Away
 Jesus Ugh youre the worst
 And it will do it over all of the
 Oh no
 What the fuck is that Hes a dragonman
What is this
 Jesus What the fuck is that
 You know what Ill use my luck
 Terrible
 
 Ill halve that
 Oh no hes winning
 All right I think I have to use an action to
unlock this cage To pick the lock
 Fuck you Five plus I dont know What is it
usually seven
 
 Im going to move around the cages or between
them so that I turn completely invisible
 Nope Thats a three
 Can I use my bonus action to Jesus what
can I do for my bonus action I cant hide Can I hide
 I got nothing else to do on a bonus action
So yeah I will try to hide
 Ill go on the side of the cart and
 Ill hide off the side of the cart
 Oh thats wonderful Its 
 Of at least Lorenzo
 May I ask a weird question Matt
 The guy that I was trying to break out of the
 Would I have seen that before I tried to
unlock the cage
 Okay cool
 Down like dead
 Yes land on the horses back
 You got this guys You got this Big rolls
 Is it your big dice Its cocked
 Oh god is he still going to attack you
 Oh no
 Do you get a reaction Do you have anything
 Oh god
 Oh god
 Catch it
 Im invisible
 What do I do Lorenzo hasnt been hit yet
has he
 Once but hes not going to go down
 I will first try to use a bonus action to use
item and pour acid on one of the locks See if
that opens it
 Well shit Then I wont do that
 I will Shit what do I do I cant kill
anything here Im going to try the lock Im
going to try the lock theres nothing else I can
do
 Its a natural one
 Yes so movement and bonus I will run
towards Caleb but not directly at the barbarian
 Lets see movement is  How far could I
have gotten with just movement
 Yeah
 Ah okay Yeah so thats fine
 Get out of there
 Run
 Run
  Oh its a slave They get a
slave
 Yeah
 Use your teleport spell
 Wow Ash
 Good job Ashly Welcome to the game
 No it wasnt all your fault just mostly
 Oh boy
 Ive got another vial of acid
 What What is pointless
I didnt even fucking know that Lorenzo could do
that You saw what he did theres no way Its
fucked
 They learned to do that in a month
 Youre just going to pick his body off
 But he woke up before maybe we should leave
it with him in case he needs it later
 Caleb shes right we cant fight them
 It would be the smarter bet
 We should bury him and leave some sort of
marker
 Keg no judgement or anything but you sort
of froze up in the little fight we had
 When you say you can take us there are you
just talking about taking us there and dropping us off
Ill do what I can
 How do we know you wont freeze up again
 We cant fight them We cant fight them
is a lawless town If you guys have got coin then
people will fight for you There isnt a lot of
honor there but there are people that are willing
to fight if theyre incentivized There might be
people we can gather at least get intel there
might be ways of breaking them out I dont know
There are people there that hate the Iron
Shepherds and there are a lot of fucking people
there that are scared of them It is a long shot
I dont think its unreasonable to say its a
suicide mission but if you want to do it if you
want to go after them they dont run the town
There are people that could be swayed But youre
going to need money
 Molly said not to steal from happy people
 Nope I think you should take everything you
can but I cant steal from this one
 Thats a good idea We certainly cant carry
it anymore its very impractical
 Absolutely Its a terrible purchase
privacy
 Are we leaving his swords Theres one that
can teleport
 Sure is
 Tell him his name too Or ooh We can make
one up
 All right
 Thats the one
 Its a loan Its a loan
 Yeah fuck those guys right
 Should we say some words or anything
 Sure Ill pour drinks
 Long may he reign
 I think youre supposed to say things about
how good they were and how many people loved them
and what a wonderful life they had but I dont
think any of those things are true or at least we
dont I dont think he even knew
 Thatll be stolen though
 Go after them
 To throw what away I want to hear you say
it Why do you want to go after them
 Wrong Why
 If you run well kill you
 Cool
 You deserve it
 
 You said Sumalee not So Molly right
 Wow You have to do a Mr Ed voice
 Hi
 Ah
 Can you bring dead people back to life
 It was worth a shot right I mean You would
have kicked yourself if you hadnt asked and later
she was like Oh yeah by the way
 They all know each other I knew it
 Do you know Pumat Sol
 It was Nila
 Its nice to meet you too
 We met your friends Family Tribe Clan

 They told us that youre trying to find the
same people we are I think Youre trying to find
these folks who kidnapped someone who you know
seeing as how I saw what you went through I could
use a little help too
 So we have an extra horse
 Ooh Caleb can turn his cat into a bird
 We fought those One almost killed me
 Was it you
Ive left my family
 You can curse in front of us if you need to
I mean
 I think youll pick it up if you hang around
us for more than an afternoon
like to use on these bad people
bit of edge
 Hardcore
family I am ready now
 Please tell us I mean if its not horribly
awful to tell
ready to do things that Ive never done before To
use my abilities to get my son back
 Son
but do we want an untested horseperson coming
with us
 Your son has been captured
into my elder she told me not to come not to
leave Accept natures fate she said But I
cannot I have been kind and peaceful and to
myself many years No more You need me and I
cannot do this alone
 Wed appreciate that
 Metal oclock
 Do you drink Alcohol Booze
long time they have a funny taste to them
Sometimes I taste that but
 Okay more for us
 Yeah sure here
 If youre going after your son I trust you
 What was his name
 Maybe thats fully grown for a firbolg
 Okay It was worth a shot
 Yes we should
for your friend
 Oh
 That is very lovely
 Yeah we have three horses oh wait you had
one too Wait did you No you were on foot We
had three left
 You are probably going to have to share Do
you have a horse
 Oh you are a horse Of course
I do I think that is the last time I can do it today
 Caleb has told us all of this
 I am going to scout up ahead and see if I
recognize them
  plus zero
 They were dead when the frost blast hit
everybody
 Or maybe he just wanted to move fast without
extra weight
 Well well cut out their tongues for food
and then bury them
man
 What its protein
tone it down just a skosh
 You dont have to watch
 Fine
 Dont worry Theres other tongues in the
sea

 When we arrive they may have left word to
look out for us They know what we look like We
should have some sort of disguise I know that you
and I can disguise ourselves You can
 When we get to the gates we could maybe
just
 For you well find a fake mustache or
something
 Right God

 We dont turn invisible
 You guys could hide under the horses or
something
 Do we still have the tents Did we keep the
tents We have the tents
 Okay Lets cuddle
 I will
 Sure
 Oh boy Four
 Both for me too
 I rolled a two and a two so four
 I do have my winter clothes I bought them
Just laying that out
 No you can
 Molly would want us to do this trip maybe
Molly should pay
 Thank you Molly
 Yeah Molly wouldnt want to pay for Keg
if you want them
that in Shadycreek Run Theres nothing there for you
 Why they dont take money Oh
 When youre home with your people are you
one of the nicer ones or are you a bad girl at
home Whats your how does it
not too many people rely on me
 They dont rely on you
 Why
firbolg that was more powerful stronger smarter
More capable Eventually I grew to accept being
myself and I prefer to support rather than be a
leader This is my first time trying to be more
than who I am
it And I heard you use the word fuck again
 This is the gate we need to hide in
 Quick hide Hide quick
 So thats just literally around this corner
few feet that way whoo whee Guards big old
gate It would have been oh man
 So hide Or something right
look different
 Yes
then youre going to be a horse
Cool
 Wait Maybe if one of our horses is a pack
horse you could be on top of the horse wrapped in
a blanket or something Youre part of the gear
that the horse is carrying
 Oh
 We can pay
expensive though Isnt it Probably The deeper
we get in Or is it the same
 Which plan do we want You hiding under the
horses or you hiding on the horse as suitcases
 Okay
 I believe that
 You can make us totally invisible
 Ask your god
 Then we can do whatever we want
 Yes yes
 I will mutter a few words and turn into
 Oh which one
 Its a dick man with a drink

 It was a me and Laura collab
 Ill make myself look like Rissa
 Because I know that one
 Thank god for the buff
 Its not as good as you described it
great storyteller I said its a gate and there
are people there What else do you need to know
You need the fucking colors and the designs
 You had smells and you had shapes and
everything but this is
 Shadycreek Run
 All right
 How much
 You know what Ill get it Dont even look
I got this one Here you go four from me
 The Greying Wildlands
 Thats who were looking for
that employ the Iron Shepherds
 That seems like where we should go because
the Iron Sheps wont be there to poke around and
find us
 Our horse is smoking
 I vote Landlocked Lady
 Lead us there with smoke signals
 Ugh gross
 Oh man
 Its a consistent brand
 Sure its really interesting architecture
 Us
 Of use Theyre good guys
try not to get they try to prevent the innocent
from getting killed or fucked over Obviously
theyre not particularly successful but theyre
not under the thumb of any particular group
 Do they have a uniform or how do you know
them How do you know who they are how can you
identify them
 Theyre like Hells Angels
 Okay
 Okay thank you  Thank you horse
for riding us this far
form I can nod
 Thats what you are like now

 The Trench
huge place right
 Lets go in the brothel Were here right
We can stay here or we go in here Do I have to
fuck somebody in there
be worried about having to fuck you my man
 Im a lady
 But yes youre right Youre right thats a
fair point
be able to to be honest guys theres not a lot
of options but we might be able to get some help
from them I dont know for sure In any case
its a place to regroup This brothel is not in
the business of spilling everybodys secrets out
 Lets go in
 Thats their headquarters right
 Yeah The caravan just came by
 I love it Its so good

you want
 Youre going to  Youre going to
stay in the alley while we go inside
 Nope Theyre mostly deaf
make a good point but this place is not making
Nila happy
youre about to see I open the door
 Forever
 Eating a dead body
 Well I mean not the companionship
 Oh
 Champ
 The Mighty Nein
 Oh
 Yes well need rooms for sure
 The estate What would we do there
know thats where the Marduns are You were
looking for them anyway right
 Were looking for one of their family but we
dont know enough to march up there and say Hey
were looking for your daughter We dont even
know if its a daughter or a niece or something
I dont know
 We dont know if shes on the outs with her
family if theyre the ones who had her killed or
kidnapped We dont know anything Wed be
marching into a big question mark
 Its like telling a fortune but with
smelling things All right
 I dont know if she knows what a brothel is
 
 Everyones sniffing your bag
things I promise you Wait a minute I do not
want him to smell this
 She doesnt want you to smell her bag
 Its something you have to earn Maybe
tomorrow
 Maybe we should get a room or two That way
if everything goes wrong if were indeed going to
go to this estate then we could at least have
somewhere to crash
 We can ask around Maybe the clientele might
know some things about the Sheps
 I think I fit in in this town but they might
recognize me
 No I mean the Iron Shepherds know my face
but it seems like theres so many weirdos in this
town that I dont know No one seemed to be
looking at me funny when we walked in Oh wait I
was dressed as a gnome thats why Never mind

 Spend the night here then
 Well have a room by ourselves
 Oh no I mean
 Not like that
could do better but anyway
 No youre absolutely right He is handsome
and he could do much better than a little
freakshow like me He could meet any girl in town
and sweep her off her feet
 What Do you have any gold left
 Looking up the spell
 Oh elven aging Cougar
 His name is Rex
 Listen you should just forgive Keg she
doesnt know that she was being insulting Shes
rough around the edges and shes right you
could do better than me Look at this This is a
mess I mean the teeth
 All right
 Why didnt you run
 Changed your mind because we had extra help
or
 Oh the danger was passed
 Mmhmm
 Of course I do yes
 I know that you want revenge for what that
man did to you and theres things I want too
but Mollymauk was amazing Showed me something
He had this spirit of life that was pretty
outstanding You know he was the moment that we
all traveled together He came up and we were all
talking and all cagey and all iffy with each
other when we met all these folks but he said
Hey want to come see a circus show and that
lit the spark right
 But before that it was All Im saying is
he was a rainbow man who represented life at its
fullest and thats what I want Even more than
what we were going for before Together were
sort of living life now arent we Before we
were in the darkness So I know we have things to
do and I want to do them But the reason I want
to find these people and rescue them is not to use
them and its not because weve invested time in
them but its because I love them We need to
find them and rescue them because were a team
now So if youre just using them or whatever
thats fine and Ill support you but I want to
find them so that we dont go back to the way it
was when we were hiding in the shadows and
ducking into alleys to get away from people We
were safe but we werent really alive right
With these people were having fun and winning
contests and killing bad guys and rescuing
children and its amazing I hope youre with me
on that and I hope we are on the same page
 Thats a good start I think they like you
 I know it is and I want it for you Weve
used a lot of people in the past and I just want
to make sure were not using these folks Are we
 Okay
 I couldnt do this without you
 Yes Lets get them home and lets kill
Lorenzo I have an idea I know my last one didnt
people Ive said it before and Ill say it again
but what we can do is exactly what they do They
go out and pick off people one at a time Why
dont we start doing that to them Follow them
track them see where they go home at night and
just pick them off one at a time The weaker ones
first and by the time Lorenzo knows whats
happening hell be scared out of his mind
 Okay
 All right To breakfast
 Ill nestle in
 Whats this What are you doing
enough for
 Why are you wearing those things
Im sorry I said you were not good enough for Caleb
 Did someone tell you to do this
just give this is as painful for me as it is for
you just give me five seconds
 Sure sure
 Can we get some hash browns or something
nice
 I dont think there was a verb in that
sentence
tongue youre sort of cute Love Keg
 Okay so a few things
 I mean you dont need to sign it if youre
saying
know if I was going to say it to you or give it to
you so I panicked and I Im sorry
 Apology accepted Dont worry about it I
have a thick skin about this stuff and I know I
havent put my best foot forward with you We got
off on a wrong foot To a brighter tomorrow
 I just made that up I didnt even have to
write it down
 No
shoves bacon in her mouth
 Okay
 Thats super weird He seems like a nice
normal person here
 Listen carefully
 Like while we walk there we should listen
 Oh
 Whats wrong with them What should we know
 No I know but why We havent paid you
okay
 How long have you been working for the
Marduns
 Do you like the work
 You mean like
 What are those marks all over your neck
 Did you get in a fight last night
 Who won
 Simultaneously
 Cool cool cool

too
 I mean he seems to know them I guess so
 Were going to go back and ask the creepy guy
how to get to the Marduns
 Odor sack
as what it evokes
 Ooh what is this Druid stuff
 First thing that pops into my mind is do you
know Kiri but I dont think thats relevant
 Dont they though
 All right Maybe How long has this curse
been here How long has the forest been
spookyooky
 Are there any monsters out there
has the forest been like this
 They only live for three weeks right Thats
probably a bad question
you This type of bird is not a shortlived bird
 How far are we from the Mardun house I dont
know if the bird is going to know
Mardun house
 Well we can describe it
 red wood house
 Red wood mansion
 Theyre probably just guarding the place
 Does someone want to go talk to them
  A southern gentleman
 Oh
 Are you Ophelia
 Oh just making sure
 It could be someone else
 Oh whispers
 Guys
 Is a really good app
 You can customize that
 You can with their new upgrade
 You can be mid dook
 Youre mid dook right now
 Do you know by whom
 The who What
Shepherds
 The Jagendoths
 We just killed one of them
one of them
 The Grudge Gang theyve hired the entire
gang or just the members of the
 Where do they hang about
 They would stay there while theyre under the
employ of the Iron Shepherds
 Would you know if they came back Do you have
spies out there looking
 Because we saw them on the road and they were
heading back here
 Does the Grudge Gang identify themselves in
some way How would we find one
 Lets get a fireplace and some iron and burn
the shit out of our wrists and then were
instaGrudge Gang Now The Gentleman has us on a
meager yearly salary but if we were to do this
for you does that include some sort of bonus
 Not yet
 Wheres that Whats that Is that a town
 All right You dont want us staying here I
suppose We should scoot out so that we cant be
traced back to you
 Oh its too late now
 Ooh is that a Cabernet Sauvignon
 Should we go run recon Take a quick scouting
pass and see what we can see
 Okay
 Is it a long walk Or a long travel
 You were in great in there
 You were great You handled yourself so well
Man you were rocksolid in there
 Give him a goodberry
 Its a Purin tablet
 Stealthy
 
 We can send Frumpkin but also we have
another animal companion now If you wanted to
become an animal something or other and scout
around that would be acceptable right
 Well Frumpkins a bird right
 Maybe we need something on the ground like a
weasely thing or a ratty type of thing or a
roachy type of thing
 In owl form
 Okay Hell only be able to see from the sky
We should still do that though first
 Go for it
 Yeah but its minus one
 Oh great
  We have to be very quiet
 That makes us all stealthy
 
 Dead
 Sure
 In his talons he could bring a little mouse
and drop it in there Im just saying
 We could but the mouse couldnt talk back
 Those are our carts
 You have a sword that can teleport you You
could bamf up onto the walkway with them and knock
one off and we could kill him
 We can certainly kill a guard That would
give us a costume but what does that get us
 We can drag his body off and feed it to a
bear Steal his clothes Theyll be like Where
did he go Where did Phil go Oh Phil You know
that old story Or we drop in mouse girl and she
could run around inside and find out if her son is
in there and our friends
were the ones that Ive seen people go into
before but we dont see the Iron Shepherds here
kept
 Sure Yes I dont know how much money we
have
Grudge Gang is
 You want to go in and scout around
 How about one squeak is yes two squeaks is
no
 Three squeaks is My sons been compromised
Please come rescue me Im dying in here Please
come get me
Three squeaks
 Oh my god everythings gone to shit
 Absolutely You are a strong powerful
firbolg Are you sure you dont know Pumat Sol
You were doing so well
 Hes one of you Theres four of him
 I mean theyre kind of all the same right
 All goblins are different
 You have an owl page on DD Beyond
 Oh god the house is full of tabaxi
 So judgy
decoration
 You know its down
so I dont want to go up the spiral staircase
What are the other two options
 Around to the side or a closed door
 Maybe theres a little crack or something
so I go toward the trapdoor see if I cant get in
 We can send a Message
 Ill send a Message saying
 Are you still
alive
 Shes still alive
 Ugh
 A Dwendalian king
 Semen stains

 Everywhere
 Oh boy Thats not good
 Youve got luck
 Oh no
 Tell us everything
 I still would like some help maybe one extra
hand
 Do a perimeter check
 Looking for secret entrances
 Stealthy searching
  Hey lets run back to town
 Southward to town
 Look at this guy
 Im Taliesin Jaffe
 Were you the little boy being eaten
 Theyre the worst
 Oh yeah
 What time is it
 Okay Oh god Its midday What do we do
 Wait is is Grudge or Grunge
 Can I just say Grunge is better name
 Do you think we should go talk one chat one
up
not sure who else we could turn to
 Maybe before we go randomly hiring people

what do we need to make this attack We can
probably get in Also were not attacking right
Were just going to go and try to rescue or maybe
pick off one or two of them or smoke them out so
that the prisoners or whatever have to leave and
we can rescue right Were not trying to kill
everyone in the motherfucking house right
 Well I just want to get our people out
 But are we going to hire muscle or magic or
what are we trying to get What helps us
 Maybe theres a place to buy some potions
stealthiest person It seems like having more
numbers is a good thing I dont know if we could
create a distraction of some kind lead some of
them away I dont know
can
 Wait
underground
 We could bring in a lot of kindling
 Tip of the spear
 Its like have you ever seen a debate team
They pick one side and the other and then they
just go at it for a while
Run Mostly insult kill insult kill
 They should really start a debate club
 You said the sleeping quarters are upstairs
If we went in the dead of night and I know you
have a spell that can lock a door or shut a door
or something
 We have some
 Did you say ten
 Oh wow
have
 Oh Thats a good question Ill reach in and
see what she has
 I need my thing Wheres the currency in
here
 I need it written down Oh there it is
 LIAM EATS FARTS Thats right its right
here I have a few hundred gold
 But then theyll have weapons
 Dont say that to her especially
all Im saying
fry like a chicken
 We have no way of healing ourselves if we
die unless you have healing potions on you
 How many do we all have She has two
 Do I have to go to church or anything
within  feet of where I put the spirit totem
 Well we did hear about that weird someone
said that theres some priest or something or cleric
 Yeah so we could go see if they could give
us
 Or come along
 So we can make it tonight
 That would be amazing though I mean healing
potions are nice but we need someone who can we
get killed a lot or nearly you know
 You have
the woods right
 They dont belong to any pact or group that
we would need to negotiate with
not even really related to the clans
 Is it worth asking a Tasker first What would
we even ask Just how much it would be to hire you
for some muscle
better for them to not be affiliated with any
particular groups so but you know This is not
a great place
 Oh I thought you meant us because were
right here We can hear you
 Fjord probably not Yashas probably is
okay Jester has already turned Shes flipped
Shes probably flipped
 Are we walking or horsing
 For the Tonight Show
 We can still find a Tasker
 No check your smell bag
better
 See if it passes the smell test
 
Taskers and The Grunge Gang
 Oh its a better name
bit of a raw but grounded spicy flavor I like
that one Let us go see the priest Thank you
smell bag
 No You cannot argue with someone who talks
to a smell bag
years I love it Thank you
 Sure
 Buttcheeks clenched
power walking
 Speed walking
 No we can take the horses It wouldnt speed
us up but at least wed be on horses
 Nila you seem to know about the woods No
good for me
 Yes please
 How far to the sides does it go As far as
the eye can see
 Thats sort of cocked Ill take it anyway
 plus nothing
 Should we hop the fence
 Is there any sign of life I mean other than
plant life
 How do we get over these things Could we
climb them or would we get cut to shreds
 You mean the tapestry
if we drape it over
 That seems very derogatory Also youre super
heavy though arent you
 We could try to throw you
you but I dont want to
 No you can throw me sure
 Thats amazing Hes amazing
 Im coming
 Im just going to dash over
 That was  plus 
 Is there a door
 How big a place is the door place
 On the roof or the top of the sorry
 On the roof or top of the structure are
there any holes or anything
 
 But no windows or anything
 Can I go over to the window and take a peek
in stealthily
  Ill take a big swig of booze and then go
over and try
 Why do you have that with you
 No
  Do you know her Do you know him
  Do you know him Whats his name
of my people  He is a firbolg This will
be good My smell bag was right again
 Can we tag along Do you need any help
 Hes Mr Clay
 Hello
 Hi Oh we have to wait
 We recently lost one of our friends
 We arent here to bury him Hes already in
the ground Weve come to avenge him and we were
hoping to find some help in these parts
 Do you work here Is this your place Do you
own this land
 Are you the funeral director
 Its a graveyard Its a boneyard
 Like a boneyard sort of a place
 But you cant bring someone back whos
already expired
 Theyve been kidnapped including a firbolg
child
 Who are bad guys Were good guys Well
were sort of bad guys too
 Are you a bad guy
 What do you grow other than dead tea
 Youre stationed here Are you allowed to
leave
 No cousins or anything
 Whats been going wrong Whats that Whats
going wrong
 So your family is trying to fix that
 This is great So you dont have to check in
every night and be here to punch in and punch
out You could leave whenever you want
 A dripline
 We came here seeking help in a mission that
were about to go on
 I think so
 Do you know Pumat Sol by any chance
 What
 All right then no No I just had to ask
 What Wait what would we owe you for this
 Money
 Tea
 What
firbolg with green beetle armor
 If the thing he needs from us is our blood or
something shouldnt we know that in advance We
should find out what he wants from us before we
just blindly agree to this What if he wants Keg
 Some sort of like concubine thing I dont
know What if hes creepy or freaky like that
 Really
 Wow
 What
seems very nice Like a normal firbolg
  Okay
 While we walk
 It is decided
 Where are we going Back to town or straight
to the
some Taskers on our side We have a healer now
but we still dont have
 We dont even know what he does
 Hes a firbolg yeah but Hey Mr Clay
Im going to shoot Beau with my crossbow
 Oh I missed

 
 Sorry I was just going to test if he could
really heal you
 Ill shoot again with my bonus action Thats
a natural 

 Not a sneak attack because she was looking
Oh boy Thats ten but its a crit Does that do anything
 Okay so thats  plus four is 
 Just the tip
 Oh but with this crossbow when I roll a
natural  it shoots another one immediately
 Do I have to roll for that one
 Thats a  to hit
 Eight
 First of all that was cool And this was
cool
 Now do your thing
 Do your thing
 Okay
 Youre welcome
demonstrated that Nott
 Is it on the way
 If its more or less on the way then yeah we
can at least swing by
 So wed have to go through the town just to
get there
 Into the woods and out of the woods
 Are you talking to us
 How old are you
 But theres four seasons Or is it three
seasons up here I dont know
 Hes between  and 
 Can I just say again I dont give a shit
about Ophelias request or The Gentlemans offer
I just want to get all of our friends and get out
If we can kill them great but if our aim is not
to kill them it makes this a much easier mission
 Yes
killing them and then switch it up if need be
 Lets swing by the baddies house and just
see whats going on
 She sniffs a purse every time she wants to
make a decision
I find significant
 No Terrible idea
 Hows the half at the house going to do
 No
 Lets swing by the house and check it out If
theres a raging party well just continue on to
town If it seems dead maybe well do a little
recon If the recon goes well maybe well do a
little insertion
 The insertion goes well maybe we go steady
 Were just going to watch
 Were going to see what its like at night so
if we have to come back tomorrow night well know
what to expect Are there more guards at night We
dont know they could have six more dudes who
come up there at night
 Well just look
 What
have that specific idea
the woods
 And then what
plan goes south if they wake up or something But
if they can talk to the plants the woods are
anyones game Theyd be fighting other creatures
not just us
 They wont leave
 Wed need to take one of theirs take Lorenzo
or something Theyd have to come after us There
would be no reason for them to leave
like would he give or would he just let someone
die if they got taken
 Or maybe not
 No its good
 
 How far
 Burchicide
 What
 We can maybe use this We could make a
distraction owl that he will focus on and we
could take him out from afar
 Silently we can kill these two I think
very easily As long as you dont move
 Can take this guy easily if Do you fight
people from afar
 How about you Nila Do you have anything
that can shoot from afar
 Well something thats not like Hey look
were here weve got lightning Something
 Okay I mean thats
 We have Beau Shes quiet I could distract
one while you go up and just 
 I can shoot one with a crossbow
 Okay
 Controlled lightning
an attack
 Well listen you can distract him with the
actual Frumpkin while I shoot It doesnt have to
be an illusory Frumpkin I can still shoot
 Thats true
 Phils the worst
assuming so
 I can if you guys I can shoot I got a
shooty thing I can shoot them
 Thats loud We could just do Message We can
send each other a message thats silent
 Calebs in charge
 We want to rescue the people who are
trapped
 Rescue the people in the basement
 Phils friend did
still a dick
 You could take off your armor
 Get on different sides of the facility
 With two other people Were splitting up so
we can take them both out at the same time
 This is inside the wall
 Oh jeez
 Theres a second floor
 But it would be ridiculous to have built that
also
 How are we split up groupwise Probably me
and Caleb split And then
 Ill take the new one
 Oh hey look
 While were waiting Ive asked the Deuce
 Are you married
 Did you go to college
 How old are you really
 Do you have kids
 Well hes a new friend and I talk when Im
nervous
questions one at a time
 Youre right
 Nila is really good at this shes great
 You married What kids do you have
hour
 Well get ready over here give us one
second
 I mean I can just shoot
 If I miss then backup plan is boosty to
you
 You cant shoot anything
 Oh You have a javelin
javelins
 I guess thats our Plan B then
 Is there anything that either of you can do
to hold silence or assist me as I shoot this fellow
it
help them too
 Lets not do that
 Okay Its fine Its on me Its okay Ill
just get super drunk
 Message is  feet
 I take out a piece of wire and send a little
Message
 Caleb Provided this plan works after we
knock down the folks someone on each party should
put on their cloak and resume their guard pattern
and keep walking around the wall
 You can respond oh you did
 Maybe firbolg could hunch over and stalk
around
to disguise yourself Every firbolg does to
shrink a little bit if you want
 She says to Caleb who tells me who tells
him
 Okay
 Oh Yes See youve got a plan now
 Were going to shoot the man and then drunky
smoky Keg is going to pick up The Deuce and hes
going to walk around
 Were working on a better one
longer than my normal name How about Keg My
normal name
 Other than shoot him again We have a javelin
and that is all weve got
the javelin  and pull him off the wall
 Sure lets do it
 No Im still going to shoot and youre going
to be ready with jav
 You message me a countdown and Ill say it
out loud to you
 Three two one go
 Were shooting at the same time
 Are you just sipping tea
 You need to stealth too
 Yeah
 Natural 
 But you said advantage So that was a three
  so far
 
 Nine
 Come on
 Mr Deuce put on this cloak if you dont
mind and climb up onto there and patrol around
if you dont mind
 Mr Clay
 You can put his cloak on right now
 Ooh nice

 So we are inside the weve lifted open the
hatch right Theres no other doors going down to
the downstairs right Thats it

want to lose you but
 And youre noisy af
going to be a surprise attack Im assuming
 What if this they know you right Keg You
could say All right Im coming down Lorenzo
 Im a pretty good Im like Rich Little
detective
 Then I could send
from the s and s kids Thank you
 I could send down an image of you that looks
like you and so if they attack right away theyll
be fighting against just an illusion
 Thank you
 Not of substance if thats what you mean by
substantial Wherever you are
 Okay
 

 I think I got an ear I can do something that
goes down and looks like Keg
 As big as Keg yes Kegs not very big
 Well shell make the noise Ill make the
video
 Yeah
 I can try I can certainly try

 But you know thats step one Step two is
much different because then what if they come out
and attack Then what do we do

 Okay
 All right so you start with an Im coming
down or something and then youll come down
Thats what were going with We workshopped it a
little bit

and make Keg walking down the steps
 Rattle Rattle Rattle
 Its a radio play
 Ooh With coconuts you can make it sound like
horses
 Wait me or her
 Its middling
 Okay and starts like narrowing its eyes and
looking around Just sort of mean and maybe gets a
cigarette I dont know how she has so many of
them Does she roll them I dont know
 From which side
 The image of Keg falls to the floor
clutching her shoulder
 Okay I make Kegs hand fall off

 Ah I dont know I dont know what happened
 Aah
 Okay step one went really well What do we
do now
 This seems a bit far
 It could be someone under the table
 Yes its someone
 From under the table and also from somewhere
else

right And then someone else could be the other one
 Yeah yeah yeah Thats them
perception checks from here

 Tonight when it looks like youre really
fast asleep Ill wake you up and ask you what
youre thinking about
 Great
 Yet
 To Yasha
 Shes right next to you
 Everyone please Yasha has to catch an
express bus out of here so we should probably get

 Stay on task Widogast

 We have asked everyone in this bar about
everyone else in this town except for Al Gore I

 What was it that got you
 Thats longer than us How did you know we
were coming
 Are you sure about that A guy who works at
the docks in the harbor where this thing is

 Look you just saved a life Thats good
news right
 Yes we are a tight crew that follows orders
as well Caleb is our leader and we
 We are enforcers of justice and saw that
justice needed to be done
 A whole boat just for a message
 Are you pirates
 Freedom fighters
 You said that youre sister ship to Captain
Avantika
 Ah yes we did know that
 Where is Avantika
 Is it a secret island
 So its an island
 Tell us about oh sorry
 Oh all right Tell us about Avantika
 Wait we already know what the islands are
Swavain Islands I cant even read my writing
Thats where we were told Avantika is
 I think those could be little pointers
 Do you live on the island Does Avantika live
on the island
 The island is cursed
 So she docked there for a while or
 The next one
 Its a dangerous game Who knows how it will
end
 Oh sorry
 Can you tell us because this is a bit shredded
you were here before right You were here
 Did the wind blow you out or did you fight
against the wind to leave Was this east is this
west where is this
 Youve met Avantika right Sorry to
interrupt I dont want to cut off your weird
evangelizing but youve met Avantika
 Have you seen her use any magic
 You survived this brutal attack You are
extremely strong
 Everyone else died You had an axe in your
head
 You had an axe in your head You survived
 Its nothing to you Its nothing Missed all
the major organs

 Youre fine
 What else do we need to know Anything How
about this ship you know this ship Is there
anything funky on the ship How much food stores
do we have How many days of food and water
 You know what we should do first Since we
have a carpenter on board
 On the side of the ship it says The Mist
 We should get some new letters going
 Yes The Mistress of the Loins I dont know
what would be a good name
 Thats not bad
 We took The Mist and now its The Mistake
 Fog
 Are there any intact maps like larger scale
maps of the ocean
 Caduceus are you down here
 All right Is he tied up Are you tied up
 Yeah yeah
 You have now officially been conscribed to
The Mighty Nein
 for the purposes of this sea voyage at the
end of which you will be compensated for your
duties If you kill any of us you will be thrown
overboard
 Also as a result of us not mostly knowing
how to sail you are also the first mate
 Congratulations
 Welcome to The Mighty Nein
 Youre the first mate Why dont you give us
an order
 Lets call him
 We found some crucial information
 Hes your first mate now And
 Yeah dont worry we took the ax out
 And we have this map that goes to the Swaven
Islands We heard the name earlier
 Thats where well find Avantika Who seems
to be some sort of cultist right
 I mean I assume shes a cultist Maybe she
just is a very nice religious person
 Yeah But he said creepy
 He said that they were supposed to collect
this sphere and if it wasnt available to go
look for others How many have you swallowed
 This is where they were going to head after
they got the ball yes
 He said that Darktow Port
 But he also said it was far away from the one
that Avantika was at
 He said it was far away from the one where
 Arent you just a little bit scared that this
person Avantika has spent all this time and
resources trying to get these things and youve
got one in you and were going right towards her
Isnt that a little scary
 But she might just chop you open and take it
 Oh yes yes
 Do we have to pick right now or can we oh
wow those are two different directions 
 Its the Mistake now We renamed the ship
 Or the SS Mistake
 MYSTAKE Were all about spelling
things wrong so maybe we should do that
 Youre the captain
 Wait farther
 Damage control
 We can send a letter
 Cruise director bursar bartender
 Ive seen The Love Boat
 Fjord should we have a quick ships
meeting
 Okay crew meeting everyone
 All right
 Thank you
 To get more hands we could either go back to
the place that we exploded and murdered
 And risk being spotted by the coast guard
 We cant change the boats appearance
 Or we could go further to
 Port Damali or some other place on the coast
that I dont know Or this other place this
island thats like  miles away
 Whats the next city up
 Do we have a lifeboat or any sort of buoy or
anything
 Are we hiring a crew Are we kidnapping a
crew
 Do we have enough money
 We have enough gold
 Ooh yes
 How so
 Oh Disparage the deads name so that when
people
 And then when anyone finds out that we did
it theyll be like Good for them for killing those
bastards right
 Seems like it would take days
 Well its the middle of the night now so
its not going to spread till morning Right
 Lets take a nap Well just coast here Can
we coast Do we have an anchor Can we anchor
 Can we just do doughnuts
 We dont have any light on here
 Were fine
 The plan is were going to find a cove and
hide the ship sneak in get some crew sneak
back Or were just going to sail right into a
different port also in Nicodranas Grab a crew
while we start a whisper campaign and bolt
 Are you talking to me or
 What
 Yes
 
 The stars
 No were on the planet
 It didnt feel very good did it
 What do we do about that
 You mean just laugh extra hard and pretend
like were having a great time
 Yes
 Absolutely And we want to stay together and
if theyre thinking that this is not working out
we have to do something to change that I dont
know about going in and starting to lie to a bunch
of people Is that going to make them
 All right Ill start thinking about what we
can do
 Oh no you did what you had to do I needed
to be with the group otherwise I wouldve been
stranded there alone and that wouldnt have been
good Next time you can just tell me though
 Yeah its all right I need it
 It did temporarily Im still very scared of
the water and I like being on the boat but
getting off is going to be a trick But its all
right Yeah Yeah were cool Its just these
other people thatre all messed up
 I know Well keep them together If all else
fails fake a heart attack Everyone will go to
your aid and then when they save you well be
like Yeah we saved him yeah
 Okay good
 No were on the world
 
 Are there any distinct flags or colors
hanging from our rigging
 Okay Can I skitter up there and see what it
is if it were to unfurl
 Can I pull it down Is there a thing
 Well ask Fjord about it when he wakes up
 On the crossover
 Does this mean anything to
you
 Maybe we should change it On the next
crossover tell Jester to paint it
 Thats fine
 Were going back Find a cove
 Its the same city right
 Do we have one on this ship
 If youve seen one before
 Weve got to chip that off Carpenter First
Mate
 Hold your carpentry duties for now and go
change the name of the ship
 The Mistake No one will know
 In a different font
 Back to your duties please
 Keep doing this motion
 Oh this is the paint can upsidedown
 And youre dipping
 Should we leave anyone on the ship
 Do we need to leave someone on the ship

out there
 I can do that
 Whos going to hire a crew We dont even
know the parts of the boat that we need to fill
You have to come with us
 No Yasha stays with our First Mate
Gallan
 If Yasha has to move the ship she might as
well abandon it Theres nothing she can do Shes
not going to outrun a naval vessel
 What are you going to do Youre one man
Youre going to sail the ship away
 
 I dont like this
 What will you be able to do by staying on the
ship If another vessel
 No if youre on the ship and a Zhelezo boat

plus
 Lets adjust
 The whisper campaign succeeded
 But we should adjust it right If theyre
looking for Jester why dont we put in a little
doubt right Theyre looking for a blueskinned
was a greenskinned dwarf or something like that
Just do a little confusion so maybe theyre not
sure who it was who killed herself on the dock I
heard she was already crazy or something like
that And then maybe the ship that was taken
Didnt it have that distinct threemast silhouette
that you would definitely recognize
 Yeah We could do some of that
 Yeah sure
 A little flourish
 What
 What is it Mr Clay We want your input as
you are definitely part of this team
 And you see her every hundred years

 Want any booze Oh you dont drink
 Mind if I drink
 All right
 Well you joined us a little late in our
adventures but many of us not me of course
but many of us were maybe outcasts or whatever
before Over the course of spending some time
together and traveling and doing some good things
mostly good things but a few bad things together
weve come to rely on each other and well it
doesnt feel like were outcasts as much anymore
Just trying to maintain that sense of a unit
Because even though weve made some mistakes and
well probably continue to it feels like were a
little bit better when were together This other
fellow in the group Mollymauk he sort of showed
us that by dying Im just trying to keep us together
 We all have our own things right Im sure
you have your own thing
 Thats good
 Thank you He will definitely need lots of
healing on this island Between you and me
Jesters a really bad cleric so itd be good if
you could just stick if I go right you go left
You stick with Caleb

large family but theyre all scattered about right
 Are they trying to save your town Is it a
town Is it your home
 Theyre out there trying to find a solution
for whatever ails it
 Youve had no contact with them
 Well I hope no one breaks in
 Im not a religious lady but I will tell you
that for me this journey with this group has
been a bit of a sign I know that youre
questioning whether it was for you but
 A sign that there could be for all of us

three hours long To be honest with you I thought
we were going on a pleasure cruise But you know

 I would say this though Just as a curious
tourist if you were to kill us you would not find
the location of the item
 We dont have a choice so yes yes

just saying
 Okay kill them all
 I dont know sure sounded like we were being
shamed Theyre not wearing any weapons theyre
just here for ceremonial reasons
 That one uses her turn to cry
 I think they have a lisp
 Im just a snake person
 That hits
 Uncanny dodge So whats that four
 Oh man Do some monk shit
 Looking really rough

hooded one Okay Ooh yeah 
 Ooh yes   Plus Ill use Fury
of the Small why not  Plus the burning bolt

 I didnt write it Wait no it says d fire
damage Another two points
 Its got that snake hood thats very thin I
assume I dont know
 I dont know how hiding works but Im going
to hide I know that this thing over here will see
me but can I hide right there hiding from the
vision of that one Does that work Can you hide
from one person
 Im going to crawl over there and hide
 Im going to hide
  but I think because Im wearing the hood
or whatever
 Okay still 
 Ooh I did my math wrong
 Not that it matters fury of the small is six
points of damage so it would have been  points
of damage
 Im so excited to find out when he will turn
on us
 Ooh
 Yes
 No Caleb no
 But youre a wee man
 Yeah but it could prevent Okay
 Youre a lost cause basically
 Oh You guilted him into healing you

 I hate water
 Youre going to what
 Trash chute
 That was the sacrifice tablet on top
 Oh thats why its all grimy Its blood
water Ugh
 Does it look like those vacuous eye holes in
the snakes are about the same size as those rubies
that I had found
 Can I just
 look for traps Can I just look for traps
around the fountain without touching the water
 
 Me
 Sure I can but that seems like more of a
medical thing
 Do you have a medical kit
 I was looking for traps I dont think I
found it with an 
 Most of them
 Caleb is way worse than her
 Are we plugging up the holes first or are we
just watching them
 Hes excellent He can make one thing into
another We used to have this trick where we would
sell people a magical box that could turn a copper
into a silver
 Ooh Did we use that one on you
 Why dont we just shove the dead people in
there and then if we see the dead people moving
well all draw our weapons and attack whatever
comes out
 Take some legs and arms and just shove them
in the holes
 We need to chop Yasha chop off all their
arms
 Jester chop off all their arms
 Nice
 Look at you Mrs Medicine
 Maybe its a magic disease
 Maybe shes got two diseases
 As were mounting up or getting ready to do
something Im going to go over to Jamedi Cosko

 We do
 Its a little something we like to call
 
 Ive got my explosive arrow nocked
 Think about this
 She throws it I fire it explodes No
structural damage only damage to the creature
Thats how I see it going down

 Like you with the keg
 Whats that
 But it wont kill the thing
 Thats not enough
 
 Ive cocked this thing three times
 Hes the invisible friend
 Fjord Counterargument
 

 It will deafen the creature
 It might bring some rocks down from the
ceiling
 No Itll make a big puff of smoke No one
will be able to see
 Yashas crying now

 Not in smoke
 Yeah We make a bunch of smoke the thing is
like I dont know whats going on
 I think thats about  to  votes if my
eyes dont deceive me
 Ive never been thinking clearer than right
now I see this working big time
 Or carry the keg in with your duplicate and
do both
 But Plan B
 
 
 Fluffernutter
 I can shoot at something
 Can we peek in without it seeing us
 Im going to take off my explosive bolt and
put on a reg
 Youre going to float your dupe across the
water and as soon as you say go your dupe casts
 Sure but your dupe floats Were assuming
that the snake creatures asleep
 Just float your dupe in and when you say go
Ill shoot Im more than  feet away so I think
I shoot at disadvantage
 Wait oh she attacks with advantage
 Im think I shoot at disadvantage because Im
longer than  feet away
 So thats a ten
 Can I bonus action No this is a single
sneak attack action
 Cool 
 Do I get advantage on the attack if Im
hidden
 The first one I rolled was a  plus eight is

 Oh okay
 I rolled lets see here sorry I rolled a
 and I will use because we short rested

 Fluffernutter would have totally obliterated

 Beau
Repeat after me Fluffernutter Im going to throw
the keg of gunpowder behind us

 Barrels are waterproof you keep beer in
them
 I just turn Beau around like  That

alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute

 She makes them black
 Im going to put up the cloak and just sneak
We hear them
 In a direction that we can identify

 Arcana check

 Sticky butt Peel off peel off
 Sorry Matt
 In a graveyard
 Go to our quarters I guess
 Okay thats good 
 What was Avantikas
 She controlled the water
 Shes the one who made the flood
 Oh when we took off I was curled up in the
bottom of the well of the rowboat cowering so I
didnt see any of that She got something for
giving up her
 We also heard a large cracking sound as if a
lock had been broken or a wall had been broken
 Are we pirates now Is that the thing
Because I dont like the water at all I dont
want to be on a boat anymore
 If I might Fjord I dont know much about
how this magic works but if theres three of
these things right at least three of these eyes
that need to be placed to unlock three temples of
whatever and release the crazy thing under the
ocean One has been activated one is inside you
theres one maybe we should try to find that
one With that one we could then safely get the
one out of you because we would have the third one
and we could go break it somewhere and then wed
know that no one could unlock it ever
 What if we surprise her tie her up then
Jester can do her Zone of Truth thing We can find
out everything she knows slit her throat and
sink her ship
 What if we just leave her She could go off
and do god knows what
 He can stay with her we can stop it before
she does it
 Shes just touching her lips
 Wait Take this vial of acid just in case I
dont know Maybe shell try something and you
just splash it in her face I dont know
 I dont know
 Sure whatever
 Nope just acid
 I did
 No not until he comes back from his
rendezvous
 I dont like it at all
 Its terrible
 This was the worst day of my life
 I mean as far as I can remember This was a
really bad day and water had a lot to do with it

 Sure
 Oh I dont care about being underwater I
just dont like looking at it
 Contested

 Just splash acid all over it

 Youve got this

  Yes Yes Yes
 Oh man Im getting some Twitchwood right
now

 The sound of fish slapping against each
other

 Theyre both of the sea
 Do we recover our exhaustion
 I should probably roll for Laura What do you
think You think shell appreciate that
 Nice
 One Eight
 So I reroll a one
 I feel like I should reroll this again
 
 It just feels cheap
 Because I rolled a one first
 Nice This isnt the next few days of our
sailing adventure this is that night
 What does it do
 Im drinking
 I dont know where Are we all staying in the
room or do we have a couple of rooms
 Lets say that Im drinking on the deck of
the ship
 Hi
 Ive got a good buzz on
 Yeah
 Hmm
 Ive kissed a boy
 Excuse me
 Have you never kissed someone
 Youre related your mom is a master of
sexuality
 Because you havent done it
 Oh Well what was the situation
 Oh you mean today Oh
 Okay Well I mean lets take a look at
this Your lips pressed against each others
 It meant something
 How did it make you feel
 Yeah Alive That is the feeling Did it make
your heart beat faster than you know being
completely stopped how it was
 If I had to do my first kiss over again I
would want all of those things
 Yes Thats the best first kiss Its someone
you care about
 It means something Youll remember it
forever
 Oh yes
 Well yes Afterwards I dont know if you
felt this way you just cant stop thinking about
it and you just feel the soft pressing against you
and almost taste him just for a little bit and it
doesnt go away for a while
 You felt a little
 Ooh
 It wasnt as romantic It was just a dare
 Yes
 I dont know Just someone I dont even
remember too much
 I sure did It was just you know I was
pretty young and kids just saying like Oh you
kiss each other and you kiss each other now Just
one of those types of games
 I think so too but I dont remember his
name
 I do Yes It was a good day
 Well do you think things will change now
between you
 Are you interested
 Well Sometimes boys like Why am I telling
you all this Your moms a lady of the night
 Sometimes boys like it if you are a little
bit aloof A little bit cold to them afterwards
like maybe they did something wrong and they dont
even know what it was
 Yes
 Yes Just a little bit of like just keep
them guessing like Did I say something Did I do
something Was I a bad kisser
 That would put him on the defensive where you
want him
 Then you cut his throat and fucking kill him
Im just kidding about all that I dont know
 No Of course not Hes our friend
 All right I will
 Have fun drawing
 We should solve this at some point right We
should get some bean bags or something

 Vague directions
 Sure I love a good powder
 Wheres the bathroom
 We just walked across the whole place I
havent seen the bathroom once
 Oh Were just going to take a shit in the
alley
 Is it Alice or Allison
 Maybe thats why she didnt listen to you
Because you called her the wrong name
 If she comes out here what are we going to
say to her
 But shes going to ask who we are What do we
tell her That were disgruntled members of her crew
 But she can turn us in Thats terrible We

 Lets go explore
 Sort of like a golf club cover
 The sea breeze At night its a
landbreeze
 Is anyone on the streets
 Okay if were going to talk about these
things lets use some code words Dont say her
name say a different name
 Yes Tiffany
 The name of the ship
 Tiffanys ship
 Tiffanys Ship is the name of Tiffanys
ship
 Thats all the code we need all right
 The Apricot
 Anything else before we get into this
 All right so how will we deal with
Tiffany
 Of course were walkingandtalking
 Everyone do this
 She went to bed shes fine
 She wont know were talking about her
because were using a new name Tiffany so shes
not even going to know
 We love you Orlando
 If I may
 Heres our options
 I dont but Ive been thinking about
things
 Im lit Im tight but feeling good
 Our intent is to get off this island without
Tiffany correct
 Apricot
 Fruit stand Apricot tree
 Heres our options Im just putting them out
there I put no weight on any of them We can
follow Tiffany tomorrow as she goes about her day
We can get in touch with this Allison person
follow her
 I know right

 We could talk to some of Tiffanys crew
right Bouldergut seems dumb
 Sorry Franklin Delano Roosevelt seems dumb

 Also the former quartermaster Theodore
Roosevelt

 Then theres this Sorris fellow I dont
know he didnt seem like hes be a font of any knowledge
 We can sabotage Tiffanys ship I dont know
what that would do because we need it to get off
the island We could frame Tiffany for some crime
against another pirate We have a signature from
Tiffany in a letter that she wrote We have that
is all that we have
 What
 You could pop in where To her ship To her
captains quarters
 On the ship On the Tiffany ship
 Thats a lot
 You can just leave
 But its our ship we work on the ship
 You mean like plant something
 Rifle through her stuff
 That would be permanent
 Wait if you could get in to her cabin you
can Disguise Self as well right You could change
yourself to Vera or something
 Or to Avantika or Vera
 Oh shit Shit
 You could turn yourself into Franklin Delano
Roosevelt You could walk off the ship and no one
would think the wiser or they might say
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Why are you on
Tiffanys ship Youd be like Bitch I work
here
 Im Franklin Delano Roosevelt
 Honda
 Can you keep Tiffany busy for you know

need some help
 Except Beau cant make herself look like
anything else
 Fake Tiffany
 I can break into things
 I can also talk to Caleb
 I can make myself look like something

 This is the best plan weve ever had
 We need someone just off the boat in case
things go awry Ill message you that we need some
help on the inside and there needs to be someone
on the outside of Honda and Tiffany in case he
needs some help in there I dont know
 Where were we meant to stay Where are the
other crew staying On the ship or on land

 All right I will make the figure think that
his crows nest has caught fire and there are
little flames licking around creeping up the
sides of it and surrounding it
 Off the back of the boat
 Yeah were stealthing
 No were stealthing
 Were moving from
 Okay
 
 The seaward side
 Yes The side away from the docks
 Jump in
 Were jumping in
 Baby seal style
 Swim away Ill hold your hand as I walk away
on the water
 Im lying great
 Just away and around
 I wont ever let go
 Oh god Im letting go
 

 Im probably a bit wet too
 Yeah Im wet
 Nope
 I mean just calmly walking away right Are
there lots more people coming
 No you look great
 You look great Do I look okay Light my
cigarette
 Youve got a cloak on
 Disguise Self Or
 Oh The Phantasmal Force
 Lets get the fuck out of here right
 Were just going to calmly walk into town I
dont know
 Good evening madam
 Dripping wet
 And dry off
 Are we still soaking wet
 Like a dog Ill shake it off a little bit
Do you have any spells that can make us dry
 Oh no your weasels dead again isnt it
 Whats that What does that do
 Are you saying to me that we made a mistake
 I agree
 We got a book
 We got some jewels
 These are hot ice We got to get rid of
these
 I know Dont worry Were going to plant
them on Allison Everythings going to be fine
dont worry
 Figured Done Mage Hand Allisons pocket
Were clean
 Hey you did good in there
 Yeah were pretty great
 Who are you talking to
 Dont worry
 There was a little hiccup
 But we took care of it
 Hey just throwing it out there there seemed
to be a couple of loose ends that we need to tie
up Can you make us an alibi
 Like suggest to someone that we were
drinking with them all night in case its asked
 Oh well then dont do that Never mind
 I assume a lot of people down there
 The best
 Dont accidentally turn it to fungus
 Sure has
 Ill do the same
 Good stuff
 We got a book Well I dont have it
 Can any of you read this
 It was hidden behind a panel like a false
panel in the wall
 Oh nice
 Theres these jewels too
 Then we caused another guard to stab someone
and another guard to jump to his death
 But we can turn this problem into a
probletunity and we can take these jewels that
she will definitely know came from her and plant
them on someone else to just sort of we could
plant them on this Allison person who she doesnt
like already
 Or maybe on one of her own crew and have
them killed
 Oh
 We could plant them on someone that we dont
like
 How about Jamedi Cosko I dont like that
guy
 We dont want to hold on
 Yeah these are hot rocks here
 We could destroy these gems and smash them up
into smaller gems
 Vera Why do you think Vera
 Isnt that just because you stole her job
That seems like a legitimate beef
 How do you know that
 She said shes going to kill him
 Well then we should roast her
 That could be good stuff
 Theres three land masses right there
 Which ones her favorite
 And I fucked him
 I dont want to say that were the best
detectives because thats already
  established fact But could this be that
we just got promoted
 Commissioner I dont know Could be We just
cracked the case again
 Dont bother him
 Wow
 Best plan ever
 Its pretty Oh but wait Its a hot rock
 We could put it in the bag of holding or
whatever
 Do we know where shes staying which room
shes in
 What the jewels We can just throw them in
the ocean
 We could snoop We could wait until we see
Vera at breakfast tomorrow and just Right Shes
staying here
 Except if we bring this to the Plank King
its admitting that we broke into the ship and
stole it
 We do
 We still need proof that this came from her
that she wrote this
 But thats fake
 Yeah Thats good I like that
 She wouldve shared that right
 What
 We could drop it in Allisons mailbox and
say hey heres all the proof you need to destroy Avantika
 Well did you see the way they looked at each
other
 Yeah he was asking for a snitch
 That seems legit That seems legit and
honest He was making an honest Right Did you
get the honest vibe from Plankie
 Ooh who knows what itll be
 Shes keeping us in suspense
 Then we can take her boat
 But then well face her head on
 Just one One other consideration
 One other consideration just throwing it out
there Were all spitballing here right
 You know that page that you were telling us
about that says the three land masses might be
the Grand Archipelago Maybe when youre
translating that becomes four land masses and a
different place
 Were going to translate one page
 No its got to be the whole book
 I would Mend the page that has the thing
about where the peach tree is
 We are so good at this
 Where does that go
 Are we all staying in this room tonight
 Well weve got the silver thread up She
cant get in
 I attack Fjord sneak attack damage Pretty
good

 Oh Whats Caleb up to
 Hide that shit hide that shit Hide that
shit
 Its in the haversack Its okay
 She cant pull the safe unless she knows its
in there
 Hello
 On the deck of the ship
 All right Aye aye Well see you there in
what a couple hours
 Thats fine
 Want me to throw it on the roof
 He needs to change
 Weve got ten minutes
 What about the jewels Should we get rid of
the jewels
 Well do it on the way
 Well yeah theyre not in the room Do you
want to pop out of the room
 Oh that The haversack
 Well what are we doing with the book and
stuff
 Do you want me to sleight of hand throw the
bag down an alley as we walk
 Sure
 Got to get rid of it
 Weve gotta get rid of it
 Im super fast
 Just toss it and then well come back for
it Behind a dumpster
 Look its a space shuttle
 Wheres the book right now
 Yeah
 Weve got to get this book off the fucking
boat
 Its worth its weight in salt
 Flawless plan executed flawlessly
  It can only be better
 I thought it would look weird
 What can it do Can it go up things
 This is going to be hard on the boat
 Now available on YouTube guys
 Is that possible
 The whole show is just this
 Ablaze
 We lost a guy on top Wasnt there a guy on
top
 Thats fine Thats a good start
 Thats great
 Oh shoot Im a nine I didnt say sorry
 Sorry Im nervous guys
 Okay
 Oh
 That was two weeks of tension being
released
 This is a fair point
 All plans go wrong guys Its okay its
okay
 Weve still got two clerics somewhere in
the world
 Nott is going to stick with the plan and run
towards that gangplank and get out of dodge
 Yeah as soon as I crest it when I get up
there theyre gone by that point right
 Whos still on the ship
 Its just me now right
 Yeah I will Nott will continue to run down
that Sorry no She gets to the top of the
gangplank shes going to turn around and nail
Vera with a bolt
 I dont think its sneak attack or anything
 Its only a  No  to hit
 All right well then Ill just keep running
down the plank and then use bonus action to dash
another  feet
 Okay
  for me
 Ive never seen Travis this nervous before
 Is that how that works Wow cool
 Is it half movement
 Okay
 Throw ice
 Oh one of the chests
  feet
 Dont forget our crows nest guy
  feet
 That hits
 Uncanny dodge
 Does that halve both of those
 Take her head off Yasha
 Im going to make all the ice turn into
bugs
 Ooh cool marker
 What
 What is that
 If you walk away does he stay there
 I will run full speed through the difficult
terrain How far can I get
 Okay Then bonus another
 Now Im right in front of these guards
 I used movement and bonus action to move and
Ill use action to  shit who do I
fuck up  Theres no one engaged with
anyone so theres no one I can do sneak attack
to Instead Ill do a Hail Mary Ill take out a
bit of fleece and rub it and speak some words
and cast Phantasmal Force on Avantika
 Shell probably save but its worth a shot
  Intelligence Shes smart
 Okay
 As Bouldergut is walking over holding a
pick or what
 I want Avantika to see Bouldergut doing this
and holding up the book Holding up the book and
waving it around Shes definitely holding that
book
 All right
 Yes thats it
 A minute
  We are kind of

 Deez dice
 Youre a big thing
 Three
 Sure sure Here we go
 Do they roll Do I roll
 
 Natural 

 
 Does this thing have a name
 Which is what
 Thats great
 Kill the guards
 Youve got a big stick
 Eldritch Blast
 Thatll hit
 You said three points right
 Oh Okay Thats not as bad as I was
preparing for
 Lot of fucks from the Willingham family
 We always knew she was
 Just once though right
 Youre invisible
 Ooh He does have a potion
 Matty Can Avantika see that happening
 Her friend using her book to smash on top of
somebody elses head
 Im surrounded by three guards
 The ones around Yasha are those the same
guards or are any of these people from the ship
 I will disengage and make my way towards
Fjord and Caleb
  more feet I think
 Its alive Oh wow
 Caleb
 Avantikas not going to be alive to defend
herself against our accusations
 No really She was a really bad person
before we killed her and everyone on the boat
 Oh thats the guy who was already at the
gangplank
 Matts making me feel sad for these people
 This is what we do to crews on ships
 We hate seamen
 Oh god Are we giving up
 Theres only six or seven of them Were
super powerful
 Dildos
 Im running Im not going back to jail
 Yeah Im going to bolt
 Not great Ten
 
 Oh they both got me
 Who are these guards I wasnt next to
anybody
 From one of them
 What is that
 Its not Its a two
  I relent

want to see some more of it

 Disafuckingvantage
 Two ones in a roll
 Oh The Mist is gone The Mistake
 Yeah we have our crew
 Then you singed the other sails too

 Yeah we need to repair first
 Well maybe theres something over here He
knows about something Lets ask Orly Mmmaybe
 Is that past where were going
  Bengal cat
 On the first day we were on this boat me and
Beau and others were going to go into Avantikas
cabin and snoop around
 I didnt roll yet either but I was going to
crawl in through the hole in her floor if its
still there
 To avoid any traps and then look around the
door from the inside to see if she had trapped it
or anything
  
 Ill open it and let you guys in
 Well Ill show Caleb around the room that
Ive already been in to see if he can find
anything else
 Does she have a fragrance or anything Like a
perfume
 Ill take those
 While were down there looking around Im
us down here
 We have some secrets between us already
 Yes well
 Im asshole adjacent
 Were going to protect him like we always
do
 Speaking of your pluses
 the Expositors
Youre special forces did I hear that correctly
Is that what you are called
 Is that true It seemed pretty true
 What do you mean How do you know
 Well which parts are true
 I think youre a secret agent I think youre
on a dangerous mission a life or death mission
to find bad guys and take them down To get the
collar and bring them in to the popo or
something I dont know how it works Im not a
secret agent you are
 Do you have a license to kill
 Are there others like you

sign Secret handshake
 You guys are really cool
 Your secret is safe with me
 Come on everyone has Control Water dont
they Ive got it
 What object
 Do we have unlimited supplies
 If we find it though and we go down there
we cant go down there Can we go down there
 But then we cant make a hasty retreat
 I guess we could do a recon first
 We do How I dont
 Does it feel like water
 But its still water
 Dont you talk down to me I know what youre
up to
 He thinks Im going to go into the water for
some fucking buttons
 Oh the old button ship legend really Oh
Buttonbeard the Pirate
 He had buttons for beards
 I appreciate that Caleb but Ive got my own
way of doing it
 Ooh those spoons The little spoons the
collectible ones Fuck this guy
 Ill think about it
 Pewter Plates Those little collectible
plates from the Stanford Mint or whatever
 You two right
 Youre a threesneezer
 Just point Caleb will know the direction
 Bless or something Do a Bless
 No he does
 One last one
 Does this mean we dont have to go in the
water
 What Why Hes got an octopus
 Does it have a name

 Sorry
 Six wet willies
 Ive told him that a lot of times
 Tell us what he found
 Thats great
 How far down is it
 And how far is that
 Ugh fuck that No way
 What is this method
 But you still have to move through the water
you still have to swim through it
 Sounds terrifying
 Your ears hurt bad too Jesus
 Are you going to sing that Divers Grave
song
 This is nice
 That was good
 You have to clear that with me
 Me
 Nice How many are you taking
 We have an anchor It can only go down so
far but I dont know how
  feet  feet
 I need a minute
 Im going to drink heavily
 To the point of intoxication
 Thats a weird opener
 I think we only have the one food that youve
been creating on the ship
 
 Eyes totally closed
 Shit
  When we get back to the surface I
will kill you
 Disadvantage
 Four
 No Just me
 Oh my god Matt
 I feel like there was so much more on the
island that we did not
 Theres Allison there was shit alleys and
there was all kinds of fun stuff
 Yeah I did
 Sorry

 Eyes of the Grave
 You know the ship that started your whole
backstory

 Im going to try to drink underwater
 Going to attempt to drink alcohol
underwater
 Oh shit
 Ill try to coax it out 
 Gets the job done
 Were you being pursued by anyone
 That sounds crazy
 Youre nervous down there
 If you find the orb you should totally bond
with it and get all the water powers that Fjord wants
 Just because
 Hello
 You dragged us in here to look around and
now were not going to look around
 Hungry eye claws yeah
 Guys Backblaze can back up your stuff
Whoa
 Someone went to the aquatic store
 Did you bust up the ship or does it come

the only way I could go underwater
 No
 Seven
 Underwater rage
 Dont let them leave
 Slow motion parkour
 Oh no

 Oh thats not bad
 Oh thats your best Youll be fine
 The shallow priest
 We did
  Seeing my friend pulled away I will swim
reluctantly forward stagger near him and say
What do you give a merrow who sings poorly Autotuna

  Im drunk motherfucker
 I will cast Tashas Hideous Laughter
 Wisdom yes  Not a high mark
 So do they let go It says they fall prone
which they cant do underwater but they are
incapacitated it says So do they let go
 Oh hes not impaled or anything
 Then I will use the rest if I have any
remaining movement to grab him by his scarf and
pull him back away
 Got it Ooh tough I will bonus action dash
and try to push him away Push Caleb to the right or
left out of the way
 Okay Nope Oh wait this is at disadvantage
 Even worse One Ill save you
 Just hit Beau Shes right there
 I will check At the end of each turn and
each time it takes damage the target can make
another wisdom saving throw
 But the target has advantage on the saving
throw if its triggered by damage
 Thats the spell
 Terrible just terrible
 Its moving away Get it
 I dont get an attack
 Am I allowed to use my crossbow
 I dont know what you people mean How far is
they from me
 I guess Ill doggy paddle up ten feet
 Ill sea turtle up to them ten  feet so
Im within  feet and then I will fire my
crossbow Its at disadvantage because its in the
water

 No I know but arent you going to go up
there
 Theres a whole round I guess Im going to
shoot not knowing what everyone else is doing

 Should I go up and prep the boat
 Its all over me
 Yasha and Beau stay together the clerics
stay together
 And it will be the end

 It was in the song
 Why dont you
 How about this Heres an idea Go back to

tridents or whatever Disguise Self like youre
one of them and then you can just swim in like
youre a bad fish
 Theyre not people
 Coins
 Is Buttonbeard is real
 I thought it was just a legend

 I could go
 I could go over and just take a look
 No
 I could send an image of a fish or something
in there and see what happens or some other type
of creature
 Hes very smart
 Yes
 
 Is that part of the legend
 I believe you
 Jester said she was holding me
 QuickAscension
 We play DD
 I could make an image of something ahead of
us
 I will cast Silent Image and project a small
dwarf man about  feet in front of us with a
beard made out of buttons and a pirate hat cocked
to one side and hes walking all prim and proper
like he owns the place Hes got a patch on his
eye thats made out of a button

 Youre wearing an octopus hes talking to

 Thank you
 No Ill be okay below But Beauregard
 In Halfling I will say to her
 Theres
someone hiding downstairs We need to act fast
but dont alert the others yet theyll overreact
You and I are the calm and steady ones We can
deal with this
 Sorry
 I just dont want us to all go down there and
scare away whatever it is oh no Im still in Halfling
 What do you think
 Who Fjord He hasnt done anything to us
 I dont know how to translate it
 Gather close everyone
 In Common
 there might be someone down below
hiding In my exploration I might have seen a
shape moving down there I dont want us to go
charging down there and blow up
 Shh Not too loud
 I dont think so This one was very specific
in its design seemed to be a oneofakind thing
I hope
 Isolate
 Contain
 Kill
 Didnt she die
 You said Jester too
  Near the galley
is where I saw the thing move
 Ooh so much better then mine
 Is there a way to flank around behind
wherever that shape was
 Hood up
 
 Why did he send us three
 Do you want me to go scare it out or
something
 I dont know how to do that
 Ooh Your duplicate
 Do that too
 Just send the Thaumaturgy then
 Okay
 Jester Fjord said to contain 
Get down Im going to point my crossbow at her
Get down Dont say a word
 No This is not good cop bad cop Were
supposed to contain Contain
another little hand slides off of it and comes
forward It comes into your face and goes
 I mean shes so cute How could I do that to
you Im so sorry
 Whoa
stuck on this ship But I have lots of chocolate
and lots of apples As you can tell thats all
Ive been eating And I wonder if its okay if I
could hang out with you guys for awhile Until we
get to shore
 What were you doing hanging out on a ship in
a pirate island
 Youre a little cutie pie
hide for a while and there was this box and it
was open and they were bringing it on a boat so
 I mean that seems like a perfectly
reasonable explanation for me
 I pull out my dead rabbits foot that I have
I have this too Its something
 What sort of thing
tricky
 Do you have it
let it leave my side I turn around and go in my
Its not this not that one Ive got all these
little trinkets of things even little drawings
that Ive made and stuff like that Theyre little
houses and clouds and stuff I pull out this
thing and its a sphere Its made of all these
can move it around but Im not quite sure what it
does But its clearly really pretty
 Amazing roll
 Its just that were surrounded by gunpowder
down here so maybe not right now
Dont worry
 Didnt need that one Its real
 Dont show her that
 We do
 I cant argue with that either
 No we should really have Caleb look at this
Hes much smarter than any of us down here
floor
 No Beau get it Get the thing Get the
ball
 One luck
 These are all the right answers
 A stench of urine
 Thats my bad Im down here a lot I thought
it was me
 Lets go introduce you to the others
meeting
 Okay so theyre all big Theyre all bigs
 Sure yes Yes we can choreograph something
Weve done that before
 No theyre all big so dont be intimidated
One of them is a big cow man but hes cool
 Theres a stonyfaced harbinger of
deathtype lady
 Shes pretty cool though Shes cool She
likes flowers
hair into a rats nest and I pull out a really
old wilted dying flower
 I do the same I also put flowers in my hair
sometimes
 Well I mean I dont want to
 No no I think she meant all of us I think
she meant all of us Its okay You can be
Theyre really old and wilted
 Thats chocolate
 Caleb is very smart and hes good with
magic He can probably determine what youre
carrying what that ball was that Beau has now
 It seemed legit
 From bad people Unspecified so far
 Oh you did something to deserve this
 Thats not
youve been living in a box
 No parents Youre an orphan
 So youre an orphan for a while
 Bullshit What are you talking about Shes
the greatest person in the world
 Oh she is whispering something
dndbeyondcomcriticalrole let them know that you
came from us Give them some love
 Shes got a rodent in her pocket
 Its a squirrel
 Sometimes a cat so be careful with your
squirrel around his cat
 Oh shit
 Happy fun ball
 Was he the docent or something
anything
 Why did you think he was mean What gave off
that impression
 You know him
 Oh
 The Exalted Collection
 You can copy off of me
 She made  gold pieces down there out of
nothing
 She has a bit of magic
tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh
 Hes assessing his new crew This is what a
professional captain does
 Just to allay some of our fears were people
actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got
onto this boat And if so how many
 May they rest in peace
There were quite a few people chasing me But Im
super fast Not really Im just really sneaky
 Do you think they might still be chasing or
tracking you or wanting to find you
 Ooh Thats not great
  Shes holding
 Caleb would know
 Im going to seeing as how she said there
are folks chasing her as we get going again go
up to the crows nest and do a scan with my
awesome perception and see if theres any boats
trailing us
 
 I run over to them and say
 Oh Twiggy just
did this thing with her tongue where she made it
into a circle It was really great youve got to
see it later
 Its really cool
 Change the name
 The Squallbeater The Balleater
 I never remember to use it like that
 Wow that was very impressive
 Youve made some allies today with that
 We could paint a new flag with your brush
 Okay Are you ever going to use that paint
 You had mentioned briefly that some of
Avantikas men and helpers had been armed with
firearms If I scout around is there any ammo
aboard this ship
  Wait 
 Any that fit the gun that I have
 I stole a gun a while ago
 Oh you might have been
 That fit my piece
 Like that
 Cool Thanks
 Thats third base

 We cant see the next deck
 Oh god
 What
 Im not doing that no way Youre crazy
 Yes Thank you
 Why do we care whats in the oh man
 Its open Go
 Or it could be the tail of a whale or
something
 Or if its their pink haversack
 What is it
 Sure Why are you looking at me when you say
that
 No Im not going in
 Into somebodys laundry bag
 All right
 Ill take a big swig and get ready
 Of course I squeeze it way too hard
 Yes
 
 It was crazy down there The lights the
monsters
 It was insane
 It was a parade of horrors
 Yeah there was nothing down there

  Clues
 Look at the first letter of every word and
then take those and rearrange them
 Weve all had a couple of balls in our mouth
before
 Did it have an exact location or anything
 Or ten spheres
 You have no idea
 What if someone else was searching for these
powerful spheres and maybe was lying in wait at
this temple knowing that someone would maybe come
bring one to it
 I would if it were underwater because I would
not be there to prevent it
 Fuck no Look what happened last time There
was a crazy ghost lady
 No she got away
 We almost died
 Did we
 Yes
 Fjord you have a thing or two to learn from
Jester about talking to people and engaging them
on a personal level She has what I would call the
expert touch She gets people She sees into their
hearts and souls You are just a bastard man
 Wait Button Wonkas factory With the
boompaloompas
 I have No ones seen anyone come in or out
of that factory and yet it makes buttons every
day How do they do it

mead Drink until I am more than intoxicated
 Fuck them

 Im kind of sick of it its the same booze
over and over again Im sorry I love you baby
I love you but its getting to be a little bit
ugh Its like if you eat Rice Krispies every day
  Lets go swimming
 Before we go Im going to pull Caleb aside
 Hey while were down there if Fjord tries
to be like bad can you restrain him Like if
something overcomes him with evil can you fuck
him up
 I would be ready to I feel like  hes
turning evil on us
 Of course I will Im not going to leave you
Youre puny and weak Im sorry

 I meant physically Physically youre puny
and weak Intellectually youre a rock star

 Reality shifting things
 Excellent I give him a big kiss on his
cheek and its real smelly Me not him
 Both
 Well dont Were in this together
 Dont forget me I wont forget you
 Always All right fuckers lets go
 Oh yeah
 
 One person or one limb
 They all have one octopus tentacle
 Should we make a distraction or anything
 One at a time
 Were not on the floor of the sea Were
above them
 How about we four and the outside three
 I will simultaneously fire a crossbow bolt
  to hit
 Another  points of damage
  Who are you
 
 Haste on Fjord Oh my god
 Oh me Im going to swim well no I have
ranged attacks so Im going to just pick one the
one that Jester missed
 Oh  No Ive been rolling at disadvantage
for its  or  from the Tinkertop
Boltblaster I rolled at disadvantage last time
 Its ranged disadvantage
 Oh underwater Oh I did not know that
 Oh Well then I didnt hit the first one
 It has to be within  underwater to hit
 I still do disadvantage
 Okay got it I fire and nothing happens
 Oh shit Ill start going towards it
 Yes I will bonus action dash to make it 
feet
 Well that was easy
 Oh so it wouldnt have worked
 Come on
 Fire at the one next to Beau  to hit
 Okay okay okay Ten
 
  Bonus action Shoot the
one next to Yasha
 That doesnt hit Only 
 Oh yay Actually its  I lied
 Not sneak attack I only get that once
 Three plus five Eight
 I swim closer to Caleb
 A different one swam up to you
 Nice
 Call tech support
 That was good Anyone need healing
 Does anything happen
 Just send him away
 
 Yeah maybe he won
 I do not
 But I can make them laugh
 I have explosive arrows but I dont think
theyll work underwater
 Before we mount this attack Im going to
about us before it means youre thinking about
them but I wont stop thinking about you and Ill
give him one of the healing potions Take this
 Im halfdevil
 Wow
 Are we all at the top of the tower Are some
of us at the bottom of the tower
 Next one
 Were we all together We were all together at
the base of the tower
 Is there a door on the other side
 
 Look at all of us
 You eat a hamburger with a fork and knife
 Are you a communist
 Oh boy
 We havent been attacked yet We just heard a
commotion inside
 Okay
 What are we doing
 Should we go in and investigate through one
of these cracks
 Sure
 Is the damage What does that mean
 Why dont we get close to the door in case
something comes out and well ready our attacks
 Oh Then thats works well for our previously
aforementioned plan
 If we can get that far
 I will use action and bonus to get over
thereish How far can I get
 Okay And Im somewhat obscured by the
aquarium
 Okay and Ill hold action of the Tinkertop
Boltblaster in case anything comes out
 Healing potion So you marked that down
 But that doesnt apply until my next round
 Okay I rolled a  to hit
 Okay do I get sneak attack Or does she see
me He It
 Okay That is  plus eight Thats  points
of no plus five sorry  points of damage
 Yes
 I turn to the group and go
 Ah
 We do
 Six
 Oh god what is that
 Is that an autocrit
 Were stunned right
 This is the round
 Plus anything to it
 Oh wow
  Lollipop lollipop oh
lollylollipop
 Spell melee
 Theres another one
 Is she still stunned or is this out of
 Ill go first I dont know how powerful they
are but I dont think I can kill one on one shot
We got to get you out of this grapple
 Oh no Hes had the worst luck I think
seeing the predicament that Beau is in Im going
to cast Phantasmal Force against one of the ones
that is grappling her
 I assumed
 Good so they fail
 It doesnt much matter I want one of them to
drop her grapple Im going to do the one closer
to me and the image that they see and feel is
that of a tiny goblin girl jumping on its face and
biting it in the eye I can roll for damage
 They suffer three points of damage and they
have a goblin on their face covering their eye
 Just the one creature
 Because Im hasted do I get a second attack
Okay I will now attack the other one with my
Tinkertop Boltblaster Oh wait do I get to add a
plus four
 Yeah One okay Thats something  to
hit
 Okay and sneak attack
  points of damage
 No
  points of damage Ill do Fury of the
Small Thats an extra seven what are we at now
 Then I will very conspicuously bonus action
fire again Thats  to hit
 Plus another ten points of damage
 Ill move into the bushes there I know I
cant hide but towards the tower
 Patient Defense whatever that is
 Let me look Each round on your turn I can
deal damage My god this is a longass spell
 While the target is affected the spell
treats the phantasm as if its real The target
rationalizes any illogical outcomes from
interacting with the phantasm
 Got it That makes sense I buy that
 Yeah no that makes sense
 Then this is the one that misses right
 Beau youre still alive
 Youre so dumb that you have to write down
 Yeah Theres four of them
 Focusing on stronger things The goblins
still on its face
 I think you had it move but you didnt have
it do an action yet I dont think
 I dont think you did an action for it You
just tried to move
 Monks are insane
 Because Im a rogue Im going to go bolt
bolt bolt and fire three times
 We got   and 
 Nope  and then really low Shit
 I didnt specify which one Ive got to
reroll all of them Im rerolling all of them
 Its all good I didnt know I was going to
have advantage
 All right first attack is 
 Second attack is 
 Third attack is 
 The one that looked real rough
  plus five 
 The first time I rolled the first two hit and
the last one missed Want to go with those
 So two hits
 I would love the bolt to
 Oh boy I would love for the bolts to go
Fjords right in front of it right
 I would love the bolt to go out through its
head and stop just shy of Fjords face
 So I should roll for those
 Damage okay Both were the same Both were
seven points
 Is that the one that has the Phantasmal Force
on it
 Yes So that one also takes an extra five
points of psychic damage from a goblin on its face
 Its a confusing fight
 Ugh What does that do
 End it Yash
 Yeah you go first Youre way closer
 Ill swim closer Ill fire Actually with
one hand I will take another swig of booze if I
can under the water somehow and with the other
hand Ill fire
 Natural 
 Do I double it
 Dice damage is doubled  
 Lets see here Its a crossbow bolt I
would again like the crossbow bolt to tickle
Fjords ear as it whizzes by
 Yeah just a little
 Sorry
 Accidentally because I rolled a natural 
I shoot again
 Shit sorry
 Sorry its the thing It does it
 But the salt water
  No I dont
 Roll for kelp
 While were around down here can I swim
around look for any other trap doors or doors
or doors
 Perception Four
 Four Oh wait plus I get pluses on that

 Theres a door or something over here
 He cares about you
 Oh that was a journey

walkaround just a little you guys could go
together is all Im saying
 No Fjord Fjord and Jessie could go
together
 Sure but so are you and you could show
him
 Go on have fun take your time
 Do you need any money
 I could try to move some of the seaweed with
Mage Hand or something 
 No but I will Its my job
 Will it sting me
 Ill go down Ill push through and see how
far I can get
 Its just dark
 And Im at the top of it right
 Thats where the roots were and it was
growing up through the tunnel or something Oof I
dont see any signs of life or light or
structures
 Oh Im terrible with this 
 What What was that
 
 They went for my jugular
 Ill take out my wire and make a little phone
call Come in Caleb hello Will you let the
group know that its a foot climb through dark
grossness and then theres a chamber down here
You can reply to this message
 I dont want to go back through it again so
Im going to stick down here If you guys want to
come just come You can reply to this message
 Last time you went down into one of these we
had to make a very quick exit Do we have a plan
for making a very quick exit
 This is ball three
 Ball two Wait You have two in you

these  and then use it
 Captain Captain Should I go under and ready
the cannons Captain
 Ayeaye Captain 
 Yes
 Special officer action
 Youre the boatswain
 No you have access to these actions as
well
 Cannon attacks deal an additional d
bludgeoning damage If the attack roll is one or
two the cannon misfires and cannot be fired
again Its an extra action other than just
regular loading
 Got it
 Good synergy
 Options
 How many cannons do we have
 How many on the side thats facing our
interlopers
 Huh
 Captain the cannons are armed and ready
Give me the order
 For all of us or just for our boat
 You could throw fireballs and shit
 Never mind
 
 Its not jackfruit
 Did we roll for the ship
 Their sails do
 Engage
 You want more
 While hes doing that Captain should we
turn to engage or no
 Captain Captain Theyre vulnerable Turn so
we can finish them off
  Yes Yes
 Pack the good powder

 Theyve got magic They could unflip their
ship We dont know
 You have the order men Fire
 Sure Three attacks Which way did we turn
Doesnt matter
 Okay Seven seven  Theres plus six to
hit so   
   
  points of damage
 I want to do this fight Maybe the cannon
blast flipped it back over again and theyve got
a second wind
 I want to kill things with my cannons
 Should we go rescue them Get their shit
 The cannons are loaded again
 Or all of them
 What if its the same thieves who robbed us
twice

 Taliesin way to break the game
 Manacles Im not on manacle duty Fire

 No
 We got one
 Salty Criss
 Im sorry what was that last part
 You lost  crew
 Are you wanted in a city there
 Sidebar 
 Captain were not welcome in one of these
towns Maybe we could make some sort of a trade
give them some pirates that theyve been looking
for in exchange for immunity or at least
clemency leniency
 Not Darktow
 Whats his symbol
 Theres also some coin that needs to be
 Are we dividing it up among the group
 Ill do the math
 Thats where Im from
 I dont know Am I
 Hi
 What about me What do you mean what about
me I just want to get off this fucking water
 I wouldnt mind swinging by if were going
that way just for a quick check in I dont know
what our ultimate plan is Do we need to go to any
more ball places
 How do we do that
 Ship
 Fjord do you have closure here on the open
seas Are you good
 Did you learn who you are
 Lets go
 Speaking of stinky Caleb what did we get
Whats all the stuff
 Like a douche
 Floats like in the air floats
 Like a lantern
 What else What else
 To make you super strong
 More than once or just once
 We could get into a tower or something
 As am I
 My armor class is less than yours
 I do
 Jester and Laura are fighting right now
 Ill look at it Well play cards for it
 Tusktooth
 What about Orly Hes a reputable
Nicodranian
 We dont have that kind of
 Intrigue Secrets
 Oh boy Backstory
 We do
 Yes
 Oh Well I dont know were  sure that
were doing that but if we did it would be nice
to just sort of swing through and see what
because they said there was some damage so maybe
just kind of see what damage has been done and if
anyone you know
  Yeah Id like to check in just
see how the place is doing and you know if
everythings still there You know just make sure
that everythings okay
 Yeah its a little complicated I really
didnt like most of it Certainly not my clan as
Ive told you guys You know theres a few folks
that I didnt mind so much There was one
gentleman I wouldnt mind just checking in on
make sure hes okay
  No just a friend of mine that I
just wanted
 No Theyre not my friends at all Theyre
bad No this was just this halfling man who lived
in the town near where the goblins lived and so I
maybe just want to see if hes okay
 He was very special to me and I just want
to Im worried about him Do you have anyone
like that
 Well you do just
 Not at home yes
 Oh I would assume not No Theyre not okay
with me I did not leave under good circumstances
with them If we pass through I would either not
want to see them or if we did be ready for a fight
 Mmhmm  Yeah I dont really
 Im sorry Im just so nervous about it I
dont want to see the clan ever again if I can
help it
 Well we might have to go through it to get
past it but yeah I dont really consider myself
one of them anymore and I just want to see if my
friend is okay
 This trip on the water was not fun but
 But we did some good I feel like were a
little closer as a group and we got those books
for you right And when we get some paper and
some ink you can learn some new spells
 Yes
 You would know that I have a knack for
stealing things or what
  Well yeah Ive found that its
pretty fun You can make people think things that
arent real and you can even change things from
one thing to another Youre very good at that
arent you

 We should sleep
 Good night
 Wow what a way to start the year
 I know
 Smart smart always smart
 I will also change I want to see
what it would be like to be a goblin still
except with not green skin
Lets pick a different color
 Maybe pink Something thats like
Oh thats not a monster
 Yeah Thats a little pink pixie thing
or something
 Wings
 The tiniest wings
 Dragonfly wings yes
 Is he mocking Orly Oh my god
The Wharfmasters a dick
 Really
 One of the cannons is broken
I found it that way though so
you should probably fix that while were gone
 You seem unreasonably excited about that
 Do you need any help What are you going to
make something

for a blacksmith
 Lets go ask around for a blacksmith
 Why dont we split off and some of us can
look for a blacksmith and some can look for a
bookshop and then well reconnoiter somewhere
 I would love to come along yes

where we would meet later
 Oh shit
 On the walk towards Moms house

 A park that we pass
 I want to maybe while they were in there

 Shes making a game system
 Bring the paint
 Caleb I promise you if we go scope

 Also we might be doing a covert
walkby of this place
 That could definitely happen

potions that we find around
 Hello

 She was great Bobsnopper
 We could probably kill her
 The Tide Peak The tower right
 Fjord
 Dont you have an ability where you can
disappear and reappear a few feet somewhere else
 Could you not do that and just be quickly
inside
 But you could just disappear and reappear
inside the wall couldnt you
 Im just a caveman
 All right
 What
 Hick queens
 Jester could get us up there
 Caduceus has a tree
 Caduceus dont you have a magic tree
 Not if we ride it up to the top then leave
someone behind to chop it down real quick
 To be inside
 Profit
 We were going to make one
 What
 Oh jesus
 You missed a bunch
 No its true but we need to figure out how
were going to talk our way into this place tomorrow
 I tried but the little guy got away before I
spoke
 There was a little goblin guy Which by the
way none of you should trust
 He will turn around and stab you in the back
the second youre not looking
 Because hes a goblin
 The front door Cant you see it right
there
 
 Oh yes
 Were going to need some information to give
to get in
 I dont know Something that would make a
powerful mage want to talk to us We need to know
a magical secret
 Or talk to him about Ukotoa
 Thats true These are all truths
 Not without money
 Caleb will know what to say
 With magic especially
 Hes an amazing talker Hes charming and
handsome
 Get a room
 I ate just a part of the tail but the rest of
is a little chewed on but in paper for dinner
 Caleb what is going to get us in that door
Is it information about Ukotoa
 We talked about this over dinner
last night
 We definitely did we had a big dinner
Anyway
 Hes just being coy We need a story to get us
past the fucking goblinman whos keeping us from
getting in the tower Something to share something
that his master Yussa Errenis would find yussaful
 I have an actual reason
 A powerful mage with access
to magical spells and books
 No Maybe we just take a few books
 Its true and its impending danger
I like that one a lot
 Thats right there is still one Ukotoa
gate out there that we dont know where it is
maybe this mage knows where it is
 We all have questions and theres a lot of
unknowns out there and if this person could check
off just one of the boxes then that would
be worth it Maybe we make an ally and he
can check off more than one box tell us
about the dodecahedron
 We are
 Is it on our side or around the
 First good roll of the night
 Thats true
 Give him some information
 Dangerous information
 We might not want to shout it
in the streets up to you
 Give him some info
  Maybe take someone who can
get word out
 You plus one You get a plus one
 What might we want to show him
 No
 Is there any evidence Do we have any items
from the Xhorhasian the crick that we found
 Do you want Fappy Fun Ball
 You do want Fappy Fun Ball
 Should we give him Fappy Fun Ball
 Caduceus just bringing this up
 you know
that Beau ruins every situation shes in
 And is horribly abrasive to talk to
and sometimes look at
 Youre not taking the dodecahedron
in right
 But one of you should look at it
before you go in
 You should take Caleb
hes a master of magic
  Next
 Yep
 I think so
 
 I drop the fish that I was halfdone eating
 Yeah lets go in
 Im Nott
 But he learns very fast
 Seems very fair yes
 Probably any day He reads a lot of books
 No we just assumed
 How do we prove our loyalty
 Weve been here the whole afternoon
We havent fucked you over once
 Anything to keep an eye out for
 Well they talked about yeah
 Were all in
 Did you already look at it today
 Well were also sometimes bad people so
 Do you want to leave a pamphlet too
so he can find out more information
 She does this a lot
 Thank you for your time
 These biscuits are real good
 Mine tastes like fish

 Well thanks
 What new spell do you know
 I feel his forehead Does he
have a third eye
 Well that was great We got everything
it was exactly what I said We would go in
wed get some magic for you wed get
some knowledge Good job Beau
 Caduceus good job
 
 Well now what What place what tower do we
break into next What do we get out of here
 Hmm

 Were you there
 How did they get away the cricks
Did they go underground
 Which tunnels Where
 All right Thank you
Im sorry for your loss
 Yes
 Hmm
 Yes If you could could you look
around this wreckage a bit and see
if you find anything interesting
 I will unlock it
 Not good 
 Jester open the door
 Caleb Open it
 Is it magical
 It wasnt
 Mmhmm
 Does it look like there was a struggle in here
or its been turned by someone looking for something
  
 Thats way worse Yours is much better
 I dont know
 Chemicals There was chemicals here
He kept chemicals
 Theres a box you said
 Im going to go over and open it
Or is it locked
 I will unlock it Thats 
 I open it
 
 Ill take another drink of booze
and look in there
 Hold something
 Maybe Does it look like the same metal of
the dodecahedron Any similar characteristics
 Try it
 No No Ive never seen this before
 Ill grab it and throw it to Caleb
 As we continue to invoke the beacon with
extremely focused energy of different spectrums
and sources the effects unleashed are curious and
reach far beyond this laboratory The dunamis field
Is that right Have we heard that before
  sightlessly encompassed an entire portion
of the town with locals complaining of an ill
sluggish sensation thats the Slow being
dragged down Others at different experiments
rumored of witnessing people and livestock
moving at a noticeably faster or slower rate
within entire sections of the city in proximity
to the laboratory
 Based on our previous experiments and extracted
techniques from captured Kryn operatives
 Yeah Kryn operatives
 Based on our previous experiments extracted
from captured Kryn operatives the abilities of
dunamis and dunamancy within Xhorhas appears to
focus around the manipulation of gravity
 entropy and time Yet while the basis of
what dunamancy origin glyphs we were able to
acquire show it to exist outside of the
established schools of magic What you got
 Yes
 This magic by my theory is deeply rooted
in ancient history of some arcana we take for
granted If these beacons are just the surface
what eonsold rituals have been lurking beneath
the citadel in Ghor Dranas Ghor Dranas
 They were using the alchemist
They were using Yeza
 Im beginning to believe it goes deeper
Between the fragments of power weve only begun to
unlock within these beacons and the capabilities
of the Kryn on the battlefield I surmise they
have been learning to bend and break the threads
of destiny for hundreds of years Be this truth
I cannot imagine the Raven Queen looks down upon
them favorably either though the thought brings
a laugh to my lips Do I recognize any
of this handwriting No
 Does he
 We have a vial
 I dont know Hes an excellent alchemist
They would probably need someone like that
but the Xhorhasians werent doing this
Someone else was Right Your people
 Your people were doing experiments and
trying to find out and harness the power of
What Its your people Its the people
that you know and trained with
 Well fuck him
 Its your people that have done this to my
people and we have to find them both
 Not right now I have to go see
Lady Edith right now
 Huh No Nothing under the chair
 We took the trap out We took the vial
 What
 I need to check on
 Ill take another drink and then look
outside to see if anyones watching
 Well go back to the cart How far is Edith
 Okay Cart or walk
 Cart Okay
 Ill Disguise Self as a halfling Plump face
tan skin braids Ill start pounding on the door
 Edith its me Wheres my son
 Im not Let me see him right now
  Hi
 No they didnt Ill pull out the
doll of King Bertrand and give it to him
I brought you that and other toys How are you
Are you okay Did they hurt you

Did they touch you
 The mean lady What does she look like Who

I pick him up and give him a big hug and a kiss
 Oh Im sorry
 Yes She comes often
 You go somewhere safe when she comes

 Very smart Youre very smart Youve always
been a very smart boy Youre a good boy
Good job Stay safe When you were running away

 Im so sorry Im so sorry I wasnt
there to protect you I
 I was far away I was trying to get back I
was trying to come back I was I was trying so
hard but I dont have Im not strong enough to
come back yet  But know that Im always
thinking of you I send you things so you remember
me and I hope Dad gives them to you
 Oh Well thats fine Yeah it would be hard
to understand but I love you so much and Ive
never stopped thinking about you and trying to
come home I didnt want to go away Im going to
find your father I will and then maybe we can be
a family again Maybe I will find him I promise
you all right You just have to be that smart boy
that I know and stay safe all right
 In my heart I think he is
 I will be too
 Thank you Sorry Edith
 Do you have family somewhere else somewhere
out of the city Out of the village I mean
 Ah Is this I dont know Are there
any strong How do I
 To protect them
I think its safe here now
 You think Here here take this
Ill give her  gold Use this to
buy new locks or a bigger door or
 What if the next attack is there
 So theyll be okay here
 No I dont know I dont know
 Okay maybe lay low for a little while
a few days a few weeks and then
 Okay yes She can send you a magical
message and you can tell us where you are
 I dont know if they would make that
Thats a long journey
 I dont either I dont know
Im not thinking straight right now
 Okay Stay here for now and stay safe
Well come back soon Thank you
 Yeah
 All right
 Oh boy
 The chair is the key to everything
Its the thread that holds it all together
 Oh fuck
 Oh boy
  Chairotoa
 We shouldve
 Yes Yes we should get off the
streets right away
 I know a place we can go We can go to
near the river Theres a river near here
 Okay How far is the river
 Yes
 I will lead them to a spot on the
river bank that I know
 No we cant leave No we cant leave
I mean you can leave but I need to stay
 I dont know but I know that I dont know
I dont know where he is but I know that well
find clues here or we may find clues here I need
to look I need to look and I need to start
right away and I suppose you all can go
if you want but
 This is about as quiet a spot as I know in town
I dont want to go to a pub or anything
 Okay all right So you probably have some
questions for me and thats all right
 I know Im sorry Im sorry for
surprising you back there and Im sorry
that I didnt tell you more before
 I dont know but I feel like I dont think
any of us need to pretend that we all dont have
some secrets Weve all been keeping some secrets
from each other Sometimes I feel like even maybe
the thing that brought us together is that
were bonded by dishonesty a little bit
 Well some of us anyway For me anyway
Ive been holding onto some secrets I feel like
its almost like putting up an armor or something
to protect you from the past or from regrets or
something and I feel like for some of us it
could also be like a chain weighing us down and
keeping us from moving forward Maybe its time
now to remove that chain and be open and honest so
that we can move ahead So yes Ill tell you what
you want to know What do you want to know
 Okay Well hi My name is Nott the Brave and
I am a little goblin girl but once upon a time I
was Veth a young halfling woman and before that
a halfling child who grew up being told that she
was not pretty and not brave and not coordinated
and not smart and just not
 Yeah
 I was Then you know time went by and I got
a little bit older I was made fun of quite a bit
I had this People thought I was strange because
I collected things I had lots of collections
They were really outstanding I collected wax
seals and pieces of colored paper and
some buttons and fabric
 All kinds yeah
 Im afraid not
 They didnt think so I had brothers and
people in town who would ridicule me
 Yes I lived here One day I was playing a
game with some other boys and they dared
one of their friends to give me a kiss
 The boy was very nice and he actually seemed
to like it He and I became friendly and
eventually we did what people do and
got married
 He didnt mind my strangeness and I helped
him get his apothecary up and running He was a
brilliant chemist and could make acids and potions
and oils and bleaches for fabrics and dyes and all
sorts of things I helped him and he took care of
me Eventually we had a baby named Luke and he
was a bright boy Very smart he learned to talk
very early and walk very early Such a smart boy
Thats who you saw back there is my son
 I think so We had a rough winter in
Felderwin There was not a lot of crops I think
some of the animals had died that winter This
river Ive brought you to this is a beautiful
place I used to come here with Yeza Its also an
important place because this is the the goblins
would come from over there They would come and
raid us from the other side of the river I think
after that winter they got particularly hungry
and more dangerous and more daring They came into
town and raided more and more until one day they
took us They took me and my husband and my child
They held us in one of their camps I dont know
if it was days or weeks Im not sure Luke was
not doing well He was starting to starve and I knew
that we needed to get out of there somehow
Yeza is a very bright man but hes not a fighter
So I had to do what I had to do We ran in the
dead of night They werent fast Ive been chased
a lot in my life by boys making fun of me
Im pretty fast So I told them to run to the river
and I broke off and I ran a different way
The goblins followed me When they found me they
surrounded me and I fought I had a vial of acid that
Yeza had handed me and I threw it in the face of
the one trying to catch us They didnt like that
They took me back to their camp I think he died
from his wounds and he was something like their
leader and he had a wife She brought me to
another woman in a hood A magic woman
I dont know who she was I never saw her eyes or
anything This goblin told the woman Make her
suffer and they did They brought me to this
river and they drowned me in it I can still feel
the water in my lungs and my ears and my nose And
then nothing until I woke up and saw the hands
those hands the skin Then I looked in a puddle
I could see what they made me They made me
good just not Ill be honest Ive started
forgetting what it feels like to be a halfling to
be me I dont remember everything any more
I feel like every day Im more and more goblin I
dont like it at all I dont like myself at all
Im sorry I didnt tell you Im sorry I lied and
Im sorry Caleb that I didnt tell you
I shouldve told you You wouldve understood and
maybe you couldve helped me I dont know I feel
like youre almost there Almost strong enough to
help but I didnt want to distract you from your path
Anyway Thats how I got to you Thats why I
cant be in that town and he cant see me like
this my son cant see me like this
No one there can
 Ive sent him things
 Well I only recently started signing the
letters I dont know if he believes it or not
I dont know what he would think of me The people
in that town theyre taught to kill a goblin on
sight or run and get help Children are
told rhymes If he saw me like this
I dont even know if he would believe its me
 Since Ive been like this Well they turned
me and then they kept me around They used me like
a slave really I would clean out their messes and
clean up after the meals I would help their one
that tortured I would help him for months Maybe
six months Then I ran Thats when I found you
shortly after so maybe a year No More More
than a year Year and a half I dont know
Not exactly Its all sort of a blur
 I dont think we have time Hes
gone They could be killing him now
these people that have him
 I will try to restrain myself but honestly
I dont know for how long
 What do you mean
 Okay If you think so Mr Clay
 This feels much worse It feels terrible
actually This is terrible This is how you all are
all the time This is not fun
 Yes lots
 Is there such a place
 Yeza Brenatto
 Thats fine but and Im sorry Caleb Im
sorry for what I said before I feel like part of
what well need to do to find him is to know
what he was doing before he was taken
and that involves you
 I dont want to force you to do anything you
dont want to but I need you now I need you to
tell me what you know what these people might be
doing or might have taken him to or done with him
 Do you want to get somewhere safer first
 No Im not sure at all
 Theyre staying I gave them some money
Edith seemed to think that they were okay for the
time being and that theres not going to be any
more imminent attacks
 No idea
 No one does
 Well Im not
 I dont know but I know that I needed to see
him I forgot what he looked like and he forgot
what I looked like I feel like thats impossible
Thats unsustainable We need to know the ones we
love and I dont know what that was I dont know
how he felt but for me its a step As painful as
it was it will be a step towards something
 Yeah it was great It was it sucked
It was terrible
 You guys have rubbed off on me I guess
 Right How How would I convince
 Go to tell them
 How do they get there Its a dangerous
journey even for us You saw the borders
 Do we know any place safe closer
Is Alfield safe
 Okay yes Please do
 Absolutely Yes
 I believe in you Jester You can do this
 You have two more words
 Okay Thats something
 So shall we ride around a bit
 You slept with your teacher
 I know theres more pressing matters
but what did she teach you
 Cool
 It was
 Thats why you looked at me that day
 Twinsies
 Do you know them
 It was that big
 I mean I dont want them to see me either
because theyll kill me and everyone Im with
anyone in town so I think well be hiding for
some time
 Arms
 Cuts Or burns
 From cuts
 What would they do Crystals
 Do you still feel that way
 Why would they have taken my husband He was
not a magic person He was just a chemist
 What instincts
 I dont either
 He was very brilliant in his work but I
never saw him do any magicky things
 He was good at what he did He could
refine anything
 If they took my husband where would they
have taken him Their headquarters are in
Rexxentrum
 At a school at a
 The whole city is their headquarters
 Do they have magical means of transport
 So he could already be there
 When did you get your new name
 Wellshit It seems like if we are going to
chase down my husband youre going to
have to go into danger Too much danger
 And
 Yes
 No I just had more questions
 Was that one of these people that we saw
 They had pointy ears Theyre elves right
 Then what One of them look mean
 Is that someone who would have do you know
her to be someone who would be someone who could
harness chemicals and
 Would she be interested in the things that
Yeza was helping
 Could she be the one who is visiting
my home
 Then do we have because I dont know how
this all connects Do we know why the cricks also
attacked Did they sense a disturbance in their
juice or whatever that stuff is The dunamis
 Weve had the thingy for a long time It
doesnt explain why they would attack here now
 Or had one
 So they had one of our dodecahedrons here
 I feel like theres a difference between
using someone and relying on someone
 You do
 He could give two shits
 All right
 Sure yes
 It would make me happy to even know that hes
alive To get some sort confirmation that someone
saw him alive or
 Is that a bad idea Thats a bad idea
 How
 Moms gone wild
 What is the process by which you would
 Well do you think Caleb that they would
sense that Is that a magical force
Is that a divine force
 That would make me very happy
 Okay
the town right
 Except someone has to ask about
 Its a wrench
 Im going to look like just a gnome
 Like tea
 I have some tobacco
 I can give him some advice on
places to look
 This is not nighttime yet were just
 I mean we have one with us two with us
 Local doctor
 Oh someone who might have repaired one of
the soldiers or something like that
 Okay
 Dr Demi Leric medicine woman
 Next time on ColumBeau
 One more question

 Yeah well its spelled weird GEOFF
 This is serious guys
 My husband is missing
 Yeah we should look
 Wait he was
 He was taken by Kryn Not by
 Weird name
 Tell me what Jeff fucking said
 Wait he saw that happen
 Well shit this changes everything
 It could definitely hurt If she sends a
message and hes with the Rexxentrum folks
 They might be able to sense that
 Why dont we try Mr Clays idea first See
if hes alive and then well try to send a message
 Has anyone gone down and 
followed the tunnels
 So our choices are
 In the tunnel
 So we could continue following this tunnel
for several hundred miles and see where it goes
or we could take my son to Alfield or we could
head to Rexxentrum and start tracking down
Calebs old teachers
 They are I thought they bamfed out
 Im all for it What do we do
 Do we know anyone who can help us
 We cant get back there for weeks
 We know folks there
 Okay
 Or we could just walk  feet ahead
 Oh okay
 Its the most powerful spell
 Shes running She has to go do the other DD
streaming show that shes on
 How did you know
 Wow

 Shit we should have talked about this during
the fucking break
 What do we do
 Oh in the tunnel Youre not talking about
my husband who I want to know if hes alive or not
 That is a hot take Its funny that you said
that because and it may have been because I was
not drunk at the time I was thinking when you
were talking Caleb or Bren about Rexxentrum
and how its heavily protected and guarded and how
its impossible to get in and make an assault
on it I immediately thought well what if we
went in with the Kryn and attacked with them
 I dont know that theyve ganked him
First of all he might be dead
 He might be ganked but he might not be
ganked by who we think ganked him
 I assume its a hard place to
attack or infiltrate
 Poke the tunnel
 To do what
 What was your name before this

 Can we go to sleep so we can find out
if my husbands alive
 Thank you I promise you if you stay with
us you will also go through some horrible
horrible things
 Oh good
 Im like nine so I dont know about retiring yet
 I want to be me again yes Yes
I hope that someday it can happen
 Thats true Hes a very powerful wizard
That would be nice
 Well I guess it remains to be seen
 Yeah I suppose That one in Nicodranas was
pretty cool though He had slickedback hair
 Wow thats weird Lets stick with Nott
for now When Im back again Ill change it
 Absolutely
 Nothing makes sense
 That was as Caleb in canon

 When everyones serious
Taliesin is the comic relief
 Yeza Brenatto
 What
 Weve heard that before Thats in Xhorhas
 Yes its in there The cricks took him
Does that mean hes alive
 Thank you Caduceus
 Hows Yasha Because shes been to
fucking Xhorhas before
 Does she know anything about this place
 What is that Whats Deluxin
 No it is not
 Were talking about hundreds of miles
 Well yes if thats all right with you
I dont want to drag you all to the center of
Xhorhas where the beasts live and the capital
city where the empress is It seems like
if we go to Rexxentrum were in deep trouble
If we go to Xhorhas were in even worse trouble
  How do we get there I mean
are we really going to go through tunnels
for several weeks until we get
 Then when we get there what do we say Hey
everybody were here in town to sell our wares
 If we go over land well be going right
through the front of the war If we go under land
well be underground for weeks
 If you did send him a message I would urge
you to do something hopeful
 Stay alive and well try to find you
 Well he is short even for halflings and he
has bushy brown hair long sideburns
I always tell him to cut them but he always
keeps them long He likes them long
 Oh Sure yes I can I will Disguise Self
 Big nose not a great chin bushy dark hair
long sideburns sort of narrow shoulders
 Not a looker
 But he is to me
 He was wonderful
 Is
 Do you count the time that I was dead

 Any guards around there
 Fjord Caduceus any ideas on how to get our

 The answer is yes Whatever it costs

 Investigation
 Perception 
 Looks okay
 Theres nothing to hide from
 You need your spells for other things

 No we never did
 Youre right
 Youre right we never We always talked
about going to TalDorei

 For our honeymoon Never happened We were
saving I heard Whitestones really nice

 Oh by the way
 weve all agreed no one this
whole campaign is taking Lucky right
 Its the worst fucking feat
 It breaks the game
 No No ones doing Lucky Im decreeing it
as your president
 Well see who runs against me
 But my husband
 We spent three months searching for your backstory

 I hear in Xhorhas they have a captain there
who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into
your body
 Yes
 Lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in
your belly
 All right what are we preparing
 Me too but Im not very perceptive
 Ill go with you
 Im with Marisha I mean Beau Wherever
she is
 Yashas in the back Sorry Matt
 Where would we put it otherwise
 Wheres the tripod and stuff right now
 We dont know that It might be
very nice there
 Lets just make sure you dont get captured
and your bag doesnt get grabbed
 Were just looking on the bright side
of things
 Are you scared
 Or a firefly We could catch it in a jar
 See Look Beau we have a plan
 Profit
 Yeah just roll a nature check Its fine
 Traps No they wouldnt think anyone would
be following them They covered up the thing with
 feet of earth and rocks
 Were in the boredout tunnel that the worm
made right Theres no water near us because we
passed water on the way in
 You know that thing where youve gone so far
that you cant really we cant turn around can
we It feels like it would be a waste of a day
Weve got to keep going
 You could tattoo with it
 Vivid dreams man
 Me three
 Xhorhas
 Is that it
 Getting good at this
 Were making the right choice
 It really is sexy
 On we go
 Oh my god
 No
 Ah
 Well you said it sounds wet
What does that even mean
 Or it could just be wet
 Or Fjord could be dicking around
with his cheek trick
 Yes yes yes Good idea
 Dont fuck me Gil
 You got this
 You dont got this
 I do
 I do And its even a little bit yellow
You should probably paint a dick on it
 I mean you could tag the whole place
 Yes
 Its a speakeasy
 But its like a prayeasy
 You could be the bouncer
 Nice
 They They He It
 We all took feats that make us
immune to surprise right
 Whats wrong with you
 Why am I rolling these weird dice today
 This is a great map
 They look like stalagmites
 No I was hanging out with Beau
Wherever Beau is
 Yeah sure
 Thats not  to 
  for me as well
 Its going to be easy
 Painting
 What
 Did we see these attacks fail
 They dont move fast but oops
 No youre going to die
 Oh okay they dont hurt
 I dont think so
 What me
 Miss
 Hit
 Theres no save against this grapple
 It was a great game
 Painting dicks
 I lose all the close men in my life
 She punched and it does nothing
 Wait they can do that even though
theyre stunned
 I will not try to leave the grapple
Instead I will fire a crossbow bolt
at this one that has me grappled
 With advantage because its stunned
 Oh not good Both of them not good 
 Bonus action fire again
 
 Yeah
 Oh theres a couple ones Okay 
Plus Ill do Fury of the Small
thats another eight Thats
 points of damage
 Good good
 Thats all Ive got
 Banishment What
 Okay lets go
 Do we need to loot the bodies
 Ropers
 Whats that A tongue
 Yeah Ill take that
 To my belly
 This is not the right way
 But if we go back the thing will be back
 Ill shoot an arrow
 
  points of bolt damage
 Oh no its getting closer I back up
a little Another five feet
 Im going to carefully aim and
fire a gun at it My pistol
 It is disadvantage because its longer
than  feet away right
 So it would be not great 
 Reload
 Youre going to make it live
 You were eaten by it
 I think they were a couple
I think they were married
 Beau did you get hurt
 What are you doing over there
 Well we only have about another two
weeks of walking before we get to Xhorhas
 Unless you make us a wagon with paint
and also horses
 And pavement What about bicycles
You could paint eight bicycles
 Its a weird dream I had
 Do one of you magicy people have
some way of next time we see a monster
instead of killing it we could command it
to carry us or something
 Next time
 On we go
 Out of the tunnels
 Whyd you say shit Whats going on
 Okay well well come up with
another plan You guys are smart
 Lets go to sleep so we can start early
in the morning
 Barf
 Shut up
 No
 What is that Whats the oh no
What is that Thats even worse than
oh shit What is that
 Is he okay
 Like I cant breathe I cant live anymore
 Yes I know Well find him
 Youve experienced the same thing
youve drowned
 Oh thats right
 Well you didnt know
How would you have known
 No its all right Im sorry that I wasnt
more helpful in that earlier fight when I panicked
and didnt go in the water But its not so bad if
youre down in the water with your friends
 Fuck you

 Your people did this to me

 I assume theyve been making food for us
and stuff
 It would pass the time
 Its like listening to a podcast
when youre driving to work
 Oh just like the path were on
 Around what Around her waist Around
her buttocks What
 While Im listening to Beau Im
going to fold my arms so no one can
see the shape of my nipples right now

 He cant see in the dark
 Are the rocks around here dug out
like someone was digging
 
 From above or from
 He just wanted to play Parcheesi
 Sneaking in
 So we could go up to get out
if we wanted to get out
 We can go see the sun for a couple of hours
get some vitamin D and then come back down
 Edible pigeons
 No
 If we go topside what are the
possible benefits of doing that
 Were going to Xhorhas
 We could go up and maybe find a horse or
something and coax it down here to take us faster
 I dont know if this miner fellow who was
eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there
 Why would you bring them into the mountain
You would leave them tied up on top
 The worms hammer
 Caduceus cast Talk to Objects
Ask the hammer
 Who was your owner
 If we go up
 You said theres a lot of entrances
and exits to this place
 We know that the cricks have been making
many attacks so maybe this is where they go
this is Grand Central and then they shoot off
to different places to attack
 I dont either
 May I use my cloak
 Caleb
 
 Against a tiny little thing
 Tongues
 I am your leader
 Im only a half really Im half
 I can also offer you this I have a pouch of
smoking tobacco You could smoke this
and it will make you forget your troubles
 Yes
 Jesus 
 No Dont eat it Its for smoking really
You can eat it Ugh
 All right
 Theyre very small though so in relation to
them it may well be
 You can ask them
 Is it cute or not
 If you rescue this thing
could it be cute ever
 Trade your dog for it
 Just trade Nugget for it
 The cat No you cant
 Theyre on our tail
 Want me to take them out Or at least
 Disarm them
 They both have weapons
 Go to sleep
 While theyre shouting at each other
Im going to turn invisible
 And Im going to sneak back there
 Back towards them
 Am I nearing them
 Mmhmm
 Im going to try to sneak up
on the one with the spear
 And get close to he or she
and grab the spear out of their hand
 
 Ill throw it the opposite direction
down the tunnel away from us
 Then while he or she is going to get their
spear Im going to try and grapple the weird one
The one thats all weird and shit
 Oh not advantage
 Okay 
 What We were specifically told
 Yeah I am your mommy
Yeah Deal with it
hanging off him by ropes and you can see
that these flasks are basically just
stoppered gourds and theyre clattering
and banging together Hes got a basket of
swarming centipedes slung over his back
 Open
like a closed off net of centipedes
 Ugh
 Caduceus where are you when I need you
And the cage holds a creature
that you recognise as a skunk
 Hey bees
 Im going to Oh you two
meaning me and Chris
 Ah
 Con save 
of this amount of damage Which is
 Ive got one
 Youre commanding me too
 Dont make mommy  mad

 Who are you
 What do you want
 What Stick a bunch of what
 Run
play with our centipault
 Your centipault
 What does it do
 All right
 Show us the centipault
 Maybe we should set up some sort of
target for the young man
 Hes going to shoot centipedes at you
 Thats ingenious
 
 Do you know these tunnels at all Have you
explored since the worm came through
 What was that What did you just do
 Dont beat your skunk
 But youre quiet and you can stealth right
You snuck up on us very well
 Sure
 How long do kobolds live

 Do you like it down here
Do you want to come with us
 Theres other places
 Yes Theres light and other terrain
 We dont know that We dont know
Xhorhas might love kobolds
 Thats super duper sad right now
 Spurt  feet ahead
 My boy He was my boy
 He died as he lived as a spurt
 
 Is that Dani
 Because hes a what
 Its secrets
 Do we see into the chamber across on the
other side Its not a chamber its huge right
 Im terrible at this Five
 What do we do We can sneak in
We can create a diversion
 But then to what end Were going to
run in there and do what
 Do we think that the Kryn went through
and were allowed to pass
 Lets offer them some food
 Is that the splatter of dead Spurt
 Here lies Spurt
 Pugil sticks
 Then they know we are here
 We could have it there
in case we need to retreat
 Jester can get across the entire span
 I could turn invisible
I could create a diversion
 Sure
 Or just emerge from the lava
 Wait what about us What about the
rest of us Youre just going to leave us
 Focus
 Is this a real manticore or is it
an image of one
 What about Yasha
 You cant take Yasha
 Shes bigger than you
 I can run and Im invisible
 Into what
 Dragonfly
 Are you going to bamf with him
Werent you going to Dimension Door
 How far can you go
 That is not across the way That is just to
the other side of the bridge maybe
 Yeah
 Do you need me to do anything to make the
diversion look even more realistic
 Because I could
 Oh youre huffing literally right now
 You got silver paint all over

 Jester
 It was so wonderful having Nugget around
 Hes going to be fine
 This is going to go so good
 Mighty Nein we have to do this
for the memory of Spurt
 For Spurt
 The kobold who was just introduced to us
and killed
 Doesnt everyone have the creative lead
of DD next to them when they play a game
 Invisible
 Invisible
 I think we should start with the monster
 Because if I go out there and trip
the jig is up
 Jar of peanut butter Get ready for a dick

 Major Image Visuals and sounds
 Perfect plan Foiled on the first step
 Is Invisibility Its concentration
I cant do anything else
 I would say 
 Seven
 Oh no the giant totally sees you
 Oh no its just us
 Oh thats pretty fast
 Your movements 
 Ill be short  feet
 No Ill be short  feet
 Oh thats lava He cant walk in there
 Shield charge
 To hit
 Miss
 Polymorph
 Probably  feet
 Cows can I mean theyre fast
They have four legs
  What does the cow say
 With what
 Does the cow get an attack of cowportunity
 That didnt damage the cow at all
did it
 What the fuck
 Yeah
 Sure what does that do again
 Okay I will stealthily
 One minute I will stealthily emerge
 Yes Its probably been one round now
 Correct I will stealthily make
my way to the bridge around the
  Not great Oh wait I also get I have
the hood the cloak but its all canceled out
 Sure Yeah Ill just kill them both
 I can use an action to dash
 Okay Ill action dash but not up the
bridge Around the side closest to me
 Uhhuh
 Sure Yeah
 Sure that hits
 Oh yeah I think so
 Ill do whatever you call it to halve that
 Oh it doesnt just automatically drop
 What kind of check
 Ten
 Under the bridge
 And 
Im coming for you Spurt
 And then I will press my body to
the bridge and bonus action just hide
 Thank jesus Terrible
This is stealth
 
 Good thats good
 Cast Jesus
 I think it worked
 Our deceptions are so deceptive
 Do not They havent found me yet
 
 
 Do I have to make a concentration check
 
 I believe so
 I close my eyes and imagine my beautiful
husband waiting for me needing me
and I run across the lava
 With my ring of water walking
 Not right at the giant
Ill go around in a
 Sure Ill try to leap on some rocks
 Are there chunks in the water
 All right Ill do that
 Just a check
 Ten
 My armor class as of today is 
 Yeah
 Absolutely
 Less Its nine
 Other beautiful book
 Chris Perkins ladies and gentlemen
 Book designer Lead book designer
 Did Chris just say that
 Sure
 If he rolls a one on all of them
Ill be okay
 Im not at full HP
 Can I use my whatever its called
Uncanny Dodge
 It doesnt work Its an effect
 He did say Im within  feet of Nott
 I mean Im dead so
 Im unconscious
 Oh
 Oh great
 Its actually pretty close
 
 
  Am I on fire
 Then I will stick my head out through
the door and shoot a crossbow bolt
at that giant that is stalking my friend
Caleb Not great

Not great 
 Okay Thats it
 But Talks is going to be on this Tuesday
