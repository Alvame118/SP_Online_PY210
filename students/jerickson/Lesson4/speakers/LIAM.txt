 Did you have the mask on
 Well we  discussed coming to a
bigger town Its going to be a little more
difficult now You cant go it was easier on
outskirts it was easier in farms but we cant do
that here
 Okay Well I think today you should have
the mask on at all times
 Its better when were working together If
you need to steal something do it with my help
all right
 Back up the conversation a minute Thank
you I would not be alive if you had not you
saved my life So thank you
 Yesterday was really not great
 Sure Sure we will Are you hungry
 Well Nott what are we going to do today I
can go down and get breakfast and bring it up
here At least I dont know I mean Im a
little wary of just splashing back into the town
right away
 Always
 All right well lets get something to eat
then
 Okay Sure Is that easy to do find a
seat
 Is this how DD works
 A Trost for each of us please
 Yes I need books thats true but did you
find drink yesterday
 How much
 So thats also on the todo list then
 All right Okay So well do that first
 I take the last piece
 Im putting my hand on my purse
 Those coins went all over the floor
 I did Its on the table though so I think
on the table it will stay
 I dont think thats true
 A what now
 No Ive bathed before yeah I know what a
bath is
 Ive only just met you
 Hi Im Caleb
 Are you checking your DnD Beyond specs
 Just
 Nott
 Never mind never mind Could I get another
Trost over here please
 Im going to put my hand up and say
quietly to Nott the Moneypot is not for them
Its not for them its for farmers Okay
 But I said it really quietly

 But she can hear my little whisper
 I mean Im sorry not to be blunt but you
know Its pretty obvious goblins are not welcome
strolling about
 Thats right Shes my companion shes my
friend Theres nothing to make a big deal about
Thats why shes wrapped up Just leave it
please
 Somebody asked why she was wrapped up
 Somebody said the words this is Liam
Why are you all wrapped up
 Vaxleth is over Its so over
 So a literal and figurative peacock
 While everybodys watching this shit happen
may I cast Detect Magic
 Yeah we can go
 Also for the record there was nothing
magic about that Maybe hes good at reading
people but that was not magic
 Nott
  Thats silly
 
 Well it is a he This is my cat Frumpkin
Frumpkin yes
 You can call him Frumpkin
 That was a little show gift from Marisha so
this is Frumpkin
 You know sometimes less is more
 I telepathically tell Frumpkin to jump up
and sit in the lap of the woman in the monks
robes who just made a big scene and hopefully keep
her occupied with being cute
 Sure right now he likes you
 What do you mean a fake cat
 Hes both a real cat and a magic cat
 Do you feel him
 I dont know what the Fifth Edition rules
are
 Shit

 Its a very fancy place
 I have heard of it
 Yeah
 Thats a tricky question I studied when I
was younger and then I gave it up for a while I
picked it up again recently Its all
booklearned
 Maybe in a little while
 Well and I pull apart the lapels of my
coat I have books in what modernday people like
to think of as holsterstraps but theres a book
hanging here
 Bapbapbap The books are right here I
have these but these are heirlooms family
heirlooms so I dont share those but no I
like to read Thats all And Im a bit of a
selfstarter so I have to find I mean good
luck at the Academy Thats rough I hear
 All I know is how hard it is to get into
 Listen I would not be sitting here if it
were not for you Do whatever you like
 Its all right I will front some coin for
you to play this game
 I will give you a silver piece
 Wish I had more
 Youre only an hour and a half in
 Because you saved my life yesterday you may
have one more silver piece
 Nott Nott thats fine Thats fine She
won my two silver pieces Well just leave it at that
 Thats okay Shes very jumpy sometimes You
can understand weve been living in the woods for
a long time Every time we come near any place
like this were attacked jumped followed So I
apologize on behalf of
 Thats making it worse
 No I insist
 A round of Trosts for both our tables
please
 Not Baumbauch
 What is a training game
 Its fine Its water under the bridge Its
fine Its all right
 If you feel slightly worse theres a drink
on me
 Thats later tonight though isnt it
 DM did I tear that I cant remember
 That was what it was yeah
 Do you know something I shockingly think
thats not a bad idea
 Yesterday was a very bad day
 Well yes Bottom line
 can you hang with
the goblin
 We will mourn her Tschuss
 Not much We were going to sample the
different Trosts and I wanted to maybe do some
book browsing Nothing major
 There are two others to choose from here
 DM which one is the one that everybody
knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer
 Shit
 No Im just saying the one that you
swindled its got the blessing of the big cheese here
 We dont need it Its just pleasurable to
have a Trost is what they say She kind of needs it
 Can we just bring my bookbrowsing down to a
single roll to see if anything of use
 I take it easy I have one more in the first
half of the day and one in the second half
 you are poisoned
 Is that where I went the last time Except
not as myself So Ill go as myself
 All right Dont fuck me Vax That is
 Yeah the thing about even a light German
accent is that when you say Vex and Vax its
the same shit

 That is a 
 And the person who ran this place was an
older man right Just sipping tea
 Im sorry You have a nice selection here
Do you mind if I ask I havent seen any other
booksellers of any kind in town Im not really
looking for anything on farming so much Is there
anywhere else I could look into
 Zadash
 No its a fine selection Sorry How much
for this book on hoe technique
 Oh Im very embarrassed Im sorry I gave
away my last two silver pieces
 I gave away my last two silver pieces so
Maybe I can earn it back and come back later this week
 Yes
 My name is Caleb Widogast
 Okay good day thank you
 You little fucking poltergeist
 Frumpkin come on
 Oh yes Matts got to make cat sounds now
 By the way DM can I ask sometime in the
entire day when Nott was getting wasted could I
have spent an hour using Arcane Recovery to gain
back that one spell slot I used this morning
 Magic
 Grenade lobbed in by Foster at the last
second
 Do they get stored in some sort of locker or
something
 That seems fairish to me
 Well thats funny because your name is
also Beau
 I pull all I have is a dagger but I just
hand it to Yasha
 Yes here you go
 I open up the coat just so she can see the
books
 Im practically concave Is it concave or
convex I forget
 Out of game
 I just drag Nott five feet over That is two
strikes against you I think we should really just
sort of enjoy the show tonight
 Well Ill handle that for you okay
 When someone is a goblin in the middle of a
town where people hate goblins
 Technically I dragged her away but you
know DD is funny with what is known and not
 RIP
 Its pronounced felching

 Nott do you have five copper
 No Im not asking I was going to help you
but if you have it youre good
 Im going to keep my hand on my meager purse
for the evening
 The miniatures come out guys
 Probably But then the third campaign
begins
 
 Youre a cock
 I would like to use my movement to push as
far into the crowd as I can
 Halfmovement Thats fine sure I just
want people in front of me
 Thats great Thats exactly fine with me
and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic
Orb and I will send a ball of cold at the
creature that Feeord Fjord
 Yes here it comes
 My goodness That is a 
 No
 That is nine
  Now is the part
where we dance
 Hes killing the memory of Scanlan
 Thats our MO baby
 Oh pretty good That is  for me
 What are you at girl
 Level two thats major
 All right I know that its restricted
movement but I will push this way through the
crowd so that I have a clearer shot as far as I
can and then I will reup with Chromatic Orb
 I certainly dont want to do that I want to
stay in the crowd behind people and I will do
Chromatic Orb again but this time Im going to set it
to acid so see if it hit Oh thats not good
its 
 Hope that didnt hit anyone
 You said Superman punch man
 I would agree it seemed to happen with
this
 Have you had the elderly or the sick in
these tents before
 I mean Im sorry but were basically a
group of strangers Most of us dont know each
other We all have the same story There was a
show an old man became a thing and we helped
destroy it This one destroyed it What more do
you want from us
 Caleb Widogast
 While that was happening Im close to the
edge of the tent and at some point I just 
and summoned Frumpkin I have a feet outside
the tent so Frumpkins out there
 Yeah yeah
 Its a good spot
 Oh my goodness
 Look at all the s Taliesin rolled
tonight
 With crownsguard
 If I could just contribute one word the 
or so people who are outside and the rest of us
will vouch for this one the colorful one He
saved many peoples lives Dont take my word for
it Theres everyone outside
 I send Frumpkin to follow
 I dont know Im having second thoughts
about being here at all
 Yes and were not going to leave without
him Why dont we just
 Thats right
 DM
 Is it possible for me if Nott is holding my
hand and leading me to go full third eye and walk
blind and deaf here looking through Frumpkins
senses
 Right
 I can talk but I cant hear you I can talk
and hold her hand so she can stop me from
pratfalling all over myself
 But weve done this before so you know to
squeeze my hand really hard if I should pipe down
 First of the show
 Im going to call my cat back to me and I
drop the telepathy and I just start tugging you
back to the Nestled Nook Come on we have to talk
about this We have to decide what were going to do
 My cat was in there but not I
 Well we wouldve walked up to the building
the cat wouldve scurried around if possible So
Id like to think that I heard all that which is
why just I said all the things I did
 Thats eight Frumpkins
 Were not there
 Yeah Were having a talk
 During all of that I would have dragged you
back here brought you upstairs And I whip off my
ratty coat throw it on the bed and sit down on
the ground so that Im eye level with you Nott
 Nott you and I have to make some decisions
right now okay
 Yes
 Well I know why we said we were coming
here
 Yeah I didnt say I also had the idea
you know you and I meeting and teaming up has
been a good thing
 Thats what I like about you I have been
thinking and yesterday just furthers that
thinking that I dont think you and I are enough
I had the idea that we would come here maybe and
find others that we could tag along with or meet
up the way you and I did But now I think that is
a terrible idea The people we spent the day with
are lunatics I dont think that we can do this
Ive changed my mind entirely and I think we
should go but we cant now because we are stuck
here for the moment
 No
 You know I had not thought of it quite in
that way and that is a good point but I am not
convinced Im not convinced And perhaps were
better off maybe I was too ambitious
 All right Well well wait and see While
were here one thing okay No Money Pot No Rat
Food None of those plays I have silver we dont
need it right now
 Were sealed here and they are watching
Were with a couple of tieflings a little person
in a doll mask and a dirty ginger Weve got
people staring at us every second of the day We
need to dial it back a little bit
 You just talk to me You hold Frumpkin Just
keep your hands full with Frumpkin okay Hold my
cat okay
 And then this is going to blow over because
we didnt do anything We did something good
 Thats right
 But it was a good show wasnt it
 I was going to suggest the same thing In
fact I think we should go downstairs Theyre
going to be coming back We dont want to cause a
stir with them either We just want to leave if
thats what were going to do
 Okay Lets get a drink
 We head downstairs
 We did I did not come to Trostenwald to go
to jail
 We are tired Weve been traveling a long
time Weve been saving Wanted to take it easy
for a few days
 I wander away from these two with their
questions and I sit down with Molly
 I would love to see something cool
 Thats pretty good
 Have you always been an artist
 So where do you two come from
 Yes you two with the horns
 No you are very different its very clear
 Hes every color
 Remember when we started the first campaign
and all those places came in a split second and
all that history Im from Shrevnam Chicago Oh
yes
 So youre a traveler then
 Since childhood
 You have a lot of scars
 Frumpkin scrabbles up onto Notts shoulder
 Do you see many goblins walking around
cities here
 Well let me make it clear
 goblins are not
typically welcome in any cities that is why the
mask
 We dont have many of those at the moment
 Its like a nervous tick a little bit
 There is that one magic trick that youre
able to do Would you like to show them the magic
trick that you can do I pull out a small red clay
ceramic bowl Then I pull out a copper piece
Here you know the trick right
 Youre good
 Fibulous
 That is a silver coin right there
 The magic is not that strong
 Also you know they basically helped us out
today You can do it for one for them
 It can be whatever you want it to be You
have to agree upon it and you have to focus on
that word for one full day while you are in
possession of the pot
 Skinky doodie that is unique Im sure no
one else has possession of that arcane power word
I could consider it yours if you focused on it all
day tomorrow But you really have to focus
 You want to see a trick
 I am well into my second trost at this
point I can show you a trick Young lady if you
would assist me please Step up onto the table
 Adjust your minds I begin to weave one hand
in a slow circle around the other and a globe of
golden light poofs out
 A second little globule of light comes out
 Then two more at the same time come out of
my hand Then they amass upon my little companion
and form a similar sized little humanoid of light
that then coincides with my little friend She is
glowing golden on a table in the middle of the
Nestled Nook
 The Goblight ladies and gentlemen The
Goblight
 I could always do that a little bit as a
kid I was always good with magic I had a knack
for it That ones easy
 Well thank you
 Are you reading a lot
 Well it could be helpful Although Im a
bit of an amateur teacher I taught Nott the one
trick you saw but other things Weve been
working together I suppose I could try to help
you
 Oh Im sorry do you two not know each
other super well You seem like you do
 Weve seen that window thing a couple times
Its good
 Gustav the person who runs the circus is
he your friend
 Hes family
 So whats your play tomorrow
 Self destruct in  nine
 Yeah were already down there
 To change the way I look
 To leave the inn
 Why would I do that to leave the inn
 Why wouldnt I just walk out of the inn
 Yeah we could But not town we were told
to stay in town
 Why shouldnt we just wait for it all to
blow over We didnt do anything
 Do you find yourself in situations like this
often
 Thats a girl
 Everybody can tell
 Is it like one of those old kids toys where
you use the magnet to pull the little filings up
 Herr Woolly
 While theyre doing all that I want to
stroll outside and see if theres crownsguard
outside or what Im just going to get a breath
of fresh air and see whats on the street outside
of this place
 Good Theres only just the two at the
door
 Okay all right So I just take a minute or
two I go back inside And on Notts shoulder
and say were good yeah I think were good
 Im going to squat down over with you
privately I still think that this is a bad idea
but I can tell that you want to
 It really is pretty nice isnt it
 Still if this goes south we leave
 Easily
 Caleb and Nott
 All right
 So were doing this
 Isnt it simpler for you to walk on yourself
like a beautiful woman
 Well we could find some public places and
just gossip a bit see if anybody has heard of
him if a friend has died at the circus last
night
 Grimjay
 So our war against the old continues
 How long of a snake are we talking about
 The wards border the lake
 Yeah I would really love a drink and I sit
down next to him What do you have I need
something heavier than a trost Ive had enough
trosts to last me a lifetime
 I will take your liquor
 I have that I pull out eight silver Oh
wait silver did you say I do not have eight
silver
 You do
 Honestly its been a terrible  hours We
were at the circus last night and I did not know
him well but old man Brinjay fell
 Did you know him
 It was a terrible way to go Im sorry
 I heard he was sick too
 Im sure his family will miss him very
much
 Subtle guys
 Can I see whats on the spine of that book
from where I am
 Hows your trashy novel Is it a good one No
judgement
 Oh no Im fluent in Zemnian Ive read all
of his works
 Mutual fan
 I love the Farthings Embrace
 Its an early one He actually did it under
a pseudonym He did a whole series under that
pseudonym short stories
 Farthings Embrace
 Youre a big reader or just Samuel
 I read a lot but all Ive been able to find
in this town is that parchment place
 Here in town
 Burnished Bibelots Which ward is that in
 Oglen
 That is good to know Thank you
 Those are hard to find the Farthings
Embrace
 He wasnt as proud of them Early work and
all that
 That would be the place
 My name is Caleb
 This has been quite a day
 I sneak my undrunk whiskey to Nott
 I do speak Zemnian
 It means
 Do I know
 Its been a while but osten means lake No
its not Lake Lake
 Thats your work Thats impressive You
took it all by yourself
 But I saw your guns last night You probably
took the lead
 We have been in the woods for too long Ive
forgotten how to talk to people
 You obviously have not heard the news from
the traveling circus in town From last night
 Thats correct
 Is there anything out of the ordinary from
the past week or two that comes to mind Anything
off about the runofthemill stuff
 He just means out of the ordinary yeah
 Whats up
 Yeah weve done nothing wrong Were not
sweating it Im not sweating
 What are you talking about None of us did
anything None of us We protected the people of
this town
 It is true
 Thats easy Lets go solve a mystery
Nott
 We came up with bupkus
 About a minute
 Hey kiddo do you want a piggyback
 Scramble up lets go talk to some people
 Ill wander down to where people are
working Where people are moving crates around
 Okay so thats the plan is to look for
people moving crap around the same way that Enon
is said to have So thats what well do
 All right
 Not that great
 Oh That didnt help  for me
 And theres no point even asking questions
because weve asked them all for two hours yeah
 Okay well thats a big zero You want to go
book shopping with me
 Okay I believe that gentleman said that the
Burnished Bibliots was in the Northward correct
 Okay so Ill start asking questions to get
us there
 All right well I will walk up to the door
and knock on it
 Is there any breaks in the door or the
building or cracks that Frumpkin could fit into
 Are there any windows or anything or is it
all a big dirty dingy mess
 How busy is the front of this place
 No ones around us though
 Yes No

 Hello
 Yes please youre open for business I take
it
 All right
 Frumpkin climbs back up onto Notts shoulder
and nestles in
 I am scouting the city for books I am
starved for books
 Yes sir Im sorry what is your name
 Oglen Hornsblower
 Well I see you sell a great many things in
here books included This is just things youve
collected throughout your lifetime
 I dont know what you just said but I am
interested in books Particularly in the arcane
realm but any kind of book Do you have anything
that you just outright know is out of the
ordinary
 All right friend lets Its like
Winters Crest morning for me and Im scanning the
shelves
 Yes You want to find some sort of tool that
helps you do what you do best
 Investigation check that is a 
 Well off the bat I dont know where that
is in DD Beyond yet But if I open up my binder I
bet I have a paper version that I can verify with
I speak Sylvan Common and Celestial and I also
can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I
think that takes some time
 Ten minutes
 Thats correct
 Im so happy You have quite a shop here
 You have some real treasures Im
particularly interested in both of these books
 I dont know though I dont think that I
mean Im rather tight on coin at the moment so
 Maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach
 How much would you part with these for
 Which one is which
 The arcane weird one
 Okay Would you have any interest in a magic
cat
 Frumpkin disappears from on Notts shoulder
Reappears next to the little man
 Ill take that as a no
 That might be it I dont really know I
didnt think that this would happen so quickly
 Hold on I have to see if Frumpkin is still
here
 One hit point of damage
 Hes still here
 So you dont like cats I understand that
 Well I was trying to sample the merchandise
for you Because if it was just a cat it was just
a cat but this one changes to my other
shoulder hes a magic cat
 You can roll him in mud he comes back
clean He disappears he reappears he brings you
things
 Gone
 Heres what I propose I do not have ten
gold at the moment But it doesnt feel like you
get a lot of thoroughfare here so Im going to
come back to purchase this later Thats it
Thats the end of my spiel thats all Ive got
Im interested and thank you for giving me the
time
 Its okay Nott
 Maybe well come back tomorrow
 Piggyback
 Within the week I promise
 I dont think he saw
 No Just wait one moment okay Wait for me
here
 Wait right here I cast Detect Magic just
before I walk back into the store I look all
around What are your hours here As I look to
see if there is anything besides that book
anything
 Besides the book he put down
 Middle of the night even
 All right Business is business Thank you
 Bis spter
 That guy does not speak Zemnian
 Lets go back to the hotel shall we
 We spent hours there no one knew anything
about the old man
 I dont really understand what shes
saying
 You were out that late
 Are you asking for my cat to haul up our
rope
 Its pretty limited They dont go that
far
 What are you trying to do
 I can take care of that
 I have some magic for that
 That is correct Yeah I will take a moment
to do that and it will let me know
 That you know of
 One mile of the warded area
 I just need ten minutes And I pull out a
little spool of silvered thread and stretch it
out Where did you want this Over the window
 Well I can do the entire room really I can
go doorknob to The funny thing about this
thread theres no end to it So I start looping
it all the way around the room and tie it off and
take out one of my books from the holster the one
on the left side and I open it up You guys watch
as I spend ten minutes referring to the book and
tracing symbols on the floor Along underneath
the thread and about ten minutes of time nothing
happens but thats taken care of
 Yeah either that or Im really bullshitting
you and nothing happened
 Forty 
 Ten
 No I wouldnt have brought it up if
something had happened
 Thats an oval
 Thats a triangle
 
 Disguise Self and follow suit
 Yeah
 Can I start going  Oh get off you
little beast To help with the illusion
 But roll with advantage
 Im helping you you little
 Oh no
 I take Nott and slam her into a wall as hard
 I have it And I punch Nott right in the
face
 I have this Were taking these people across
to jail
 Dont you fucking move you little green
piece of filth
 This one is mine thank you Beat her within
an inch of her life
 Natural 

 The rest of you lot fall in line I drag the
little one off
 Have they cleared the way
 Are you all right I am so very sorry Im
so sorry
 Let me see your teeth Okay You look all
right
 Okay Who wants to go to the circus
 You you want to go with them Ill go with
him
 Frumpkin will go with you
 Im a little jittery do you want to be a
front man for a little while
 Okay
 You are very good with voices
 Yeah lets have a look around
 I take a rag out of my side satchel and I
cast what the hell is it called because Ive
only been a wizard for a short time one Dancing
Light underneath the rags so its only dim
 Yeah
 What the fuck are we looking for in here
 Thats right yeah
 Is there anything arcane From all my
studies does anything here ring any bell I have
a photographic memory
 All right That is a ten
 Okay What about the perimeters of here
where all the people were There was a swarm of
people I spend five minutes seeing anything was
dropped of interest
 I miss the twins
 Big ten
 I have many pockets of course I have
pockets
 Hes just in the Blue Man Group unitard and
thats it
 So this dead thing is here in front of me
 I will take my dagger and I will slice a
little bit off of the woman and its going to get
dark in here and I will snuff out the light and
use the rag to roll it up and Ill put the little
piece in my pack
 Lets get out of here Im going to be
sick
 Cleric shit
 Yes
 This Everything
 I have that ability it lets you know
exactly where the fiend is Which of those
things is the fiend
 It could have easily been the little girl
 DM on a minor note I put my hand on
Fjords shoulder and say Im going to be blind for
a second give me a little slap if anything goes
wrong And I tune into Frumpkin who should still be
 And then Frumpkin takes off
 So Im looking at myself after a moment
 Stirring the pot
 
 Whispers
 Theres no pencil smudges
 My cat is on patrol because weve been
standing with our dicks in our hands for a long
time
 No Im not complaining but I would have
sent the cat out
 I mean just because were standing here so
long I would have been nervous and again held on
to this guys big bicep and sent the cat out
 Fjord something bad is happening
 Do I know where in relation to Fjord and I
this is
 I can talk but I cant hear anything when
Im doing this
 The frog is on the move Frog is on the
move
 Away from us But I dont know where the
others are
 I come out of it and I Zombies I start
running towards the tent that I saw Jester peek
out from under
 Elf 
 Ja
 Three
 Whats your modifier
 Holy Shit
 And youre one plus nothing
 We just walked out of the tent door and are
looking at that
 Were safe
 Is that one five or ten feet away from me
The horses immediately freak out 
and start running this direction in a gallop
 Oh damn it
 I am going to move over a bit towards that
carriage and I pull the diamond out of my
component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms
over it I take my other hand and spin it really
fast and little ice shards start shooting out of
the side I take it with the free hand and Im
going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher
at the one closest to Beauregard
 DD Beyond where did you go Oh thats
good 
 Okay So that is cold damage d Come on
Nine total
 Question am I supposed to roll initiative
for Frumpkin as well
 Okay if thats what you want to do
 Im sending Frumpkin to zip under that tent
He has  feet of movement
 Yeah
 Thats it ja
 Ive seen this Twilight episode He knows
what is behind your screen the rest of the game
 Okay Im also tapped as well Im going to
back up against the tent that we came out of and
with a sinking pit in my stomach my hand starts
to blacken and flake and fire springs from the
palm and it shoots and I cast Fire Bolt
 That is a cantrip yeah Thats good though
thats 
 Thats d thats this guy here that I
never used in the last campaign Oh thats four
 I probably have a little bit of movement
left
 I would like to sidle into the tent that I
exited before and disappear Frumpkin will dart
across behind Molly to the little tent
 
 Ja thats it
 Thats my girl
 What does happen is Frumpkin scrabbles up
your back and comes to your shoulder and Im
watching everything from my hidey hole
 We probably have a half hour at this point
 Nott you feel Frumpkins claws slowly and
deliberately squeeze into your shoulder
 Caleb gets over it and he comes out and
starts helping push the bodies onto the doesnt
say anything but starts pushing bodies onto the
back of the cart
 This is not my thing I am not brave like
Nott Lets get out of here please
 I havent learned that one yet Some day
 Is its name Roy
 During all the busywork Im not saying
anything but I keep giving worried and stressed
glances at my little friend
 Would you have the abilities to burn these
things up the way we did Are you capable Could
you have killed these things Is that believable
for people who know you
 Yeah she frogged out
 I will attempt to do the same to do arcane
recovery
 Also I have a cat
 Thats not what I mean If we catch up to
them my cat can follow and I can watch
 If we find them then we assign Frumpkin to
the case and I will lean against a tree Nott will
keep watch over me and we will know where it
goes
 Youd have to erase the tracks all the way
back to the how far back are you willing to go
 Whats the plan here Are we going to flee
 I know Everybodys in deep shit I
understand the problem but my question is are we
cutting and running
 No I mean cutting and running
 We do it all the time
 Those two burnt men Yes
 Beauregard are the people on the boat doing
anything different
 Because the city is on the lake so were
just around the edge of the lake
 It depends on what were going to do
 The other thing we can do but it will take
some time need about an hour Frumpkin is a cat
but Frumpkin does not need to be a cat I could
fly him over as well but I need time I need about
an hour
 I changed my mind I believe I used arcane
recovery during the day So forget it
 If I have an hour to do some
ritual casting yeah
 At the level two Oh sorry go ahead
 Its a rules question you go for it
 Rules question Caleb is too fucking poor to
change Frumpkins shape willynilly because its
ten gold pieces worth of charcoal incense and
herbs which I dont have So hes a cat for the
foreseeable future
 I need incense herbs and charcoal
 No Im just talking in my accent to you
 Do you have charcoal
 If we can get back into town somehow
 I will
 That random book about fiends has all the
answers about the fiend were chasing Lets go
get it
 How much ground did we cover I dont know
 Half a mile
 Thats your specialty
 Drops a couple of horse apples
 I cast Thaumaturgy 
 I do but I rolled 
 You have advantage right Roll again
 
 Im going to dig some charcoal out of the
remains of the fire in the common room and then go
to bed
 Dont thank me Lovely inn Good night
 Just going to draw some dicks
 Wait is there a rest button
 Where are they
 Whoa
 We got back in the middle of the night No
real job here
 I go down Its Yorda who runs the place
 I find Yorda Excuse me a question about
the town
 Is there a pawn shop anywhere in this city
 Thank you
 Wockwurt
 Lochwards General of course Excuse me
Thats in the Lochward then
 Only been here two days Okay you are down
here
 Yeah okay That flask
 Yes I did see it
 No Im not sorry at all but I have a big
favor to ask you Thats very valuable what you
have there Do you know that is made of platinum
 Let me explain it to you That little bottle
is worth a great deal It can buy you many full bottles
 Would you like to trade that for many bottles
of booze Many
 We could buy you another flask that can hold
whiskey just as well as that one Heres the
thing you know that I was very interested in
those books We came here for books and booze
Youve gotten a little booze but we can get a lot
and those books are expensive and I know that we
can get enough money for it and I really dont
feel like pushing our luck with the law here in
town and pulling a fast one again
 They were worth a total of  gold
 Did she just hand me  gold
 I take her by the head and I rustle our
heads together
 Thats a good deal I leave to find that
place
 Oh youre coming too What a good day this
is All right lets go shopping
 Hello there my friend Just as I said Ive
returned I have what we agreed on  gold for
these two books that we discussed
 Free books
 These are the same two books As yesterday
 Oh I was asking Matthew these are the same
two books
 Oh good Excellent
 I never stopped with the British either last
time so Im never going to stop Oh Im so
happy and Im saying this out loud as Caleb Good
day to you
 I scoop up Nott and I just start dancing
down the street with her up onto my shoulders
 No We have plans to make with our new
friends Lets go get some breakfast
 Nope Were away
 Good shopping run Where did you get 
gold
 Good to know I dont need to know anything
more Im just happy that you have it Im
thankful
 I just squeeze the cheeks and I look at my
books
 Yes I will start on the one about fiends
because it is topical
 No Im going to read here Good focus
 Yeah go away
 I shove the book deep into my belt near my
dick so she doesnt want to go near it
 Good point Hey now
 I do not let her I am in a corner
 How long was that for
 Oh this is about grumpkins and
periwinkles
 What is a periwinkle
 Occasional drawings Theres no penises
drawn in this book so I dont think youd be
interested
 Leave me alone Im reading
 I need  actual seconds to see what the
piece of paper says
 Do I remember people talking about
nightmares from the past couple of days Not Liam
but Caleb
 Okay and I didnt overhear okay
 I mean its chockablock with a lot of
things most of it probably untrue and stories to
scare your children but there is some sort of
demon that is described as being fat and rotund
and it talks about I mean this is too
coincidental it cant be the thing that were
what are the odds of something being in this book
and its what were chasing today But this is
describing some sort of scaled demon that feeds on
people in the night when theyre sleeping and it
leaves corrupted undead corpses behind known as
husks
 Does this book is it of this town or
 General book could be anywhere
 You havent heard the word nergaliid
 Because thats what Im talking about here
 Once again I have no idea if this is the
creature that were in pursuit of but this talks
about it not eating food but siphoning the life
off of mortal creatures but not to the point of
death or harming them They might not even notice
that its happening
 It says that this thing has two types of
one is quick with much pain and anguish
 No
 It does not
 Right its a kids Encyclopedia Britannica
and scanning through I saw one thing that popped out
 May I ask with my intelligence score of 
and the Keen Mind feat could we say that Caleb is
a speed reader
 Believably not magic
 Good times
 It was still funny when it was just implied
You can paint it across the wall
 Were talking about masturbation
 Would you say that Caleb is a speedbeater
 I could I could also heres the thing
about my cat Hes a cat definitely a cat but is
also a fey creature If I have an hour he doesnt
have to be a cat He can temporarily be a bird
 Well I have a lot of charcoal now and you
said you have incense on you
 Let it all out Go for it Dont hold back
 Yes I prefer him as a cat to be honest
but in a pinch
 Well not any kind of creature but Ive made
him an octopus once There was this one time when
Nott was very high up in a burning building and we
had no way to get her down
 I think its octopi
 It can be pricey to keep bringing him back
and all that but he no you cant kill him
 Shes eaten him twice
 I will need about an hour of time Ill probably 
head upstairs Do you have a pot I could borrow
 I was hoping you had an iron pot I could
borrow for never mind Ill use the piss pot
Ill borrow this
 Is this enough to juryrig
 Its ten gold
 Thats why I asked
 Okay this is a joke I need to actually go
to the incense store
 Charcoal and incense yeah 
For this plan to work
 Do you have ten gold
 Were still in trouble with the law I dont
want to push that If we have the gold thats the
safest path
 Brain wipe Im going to go up to my room and it takes
me an hour to do this An hour and ten minutes to
be exact I put the
 Look at the dungeon master Is that maybe
the longest facepalm
 I go upstairs to cast Find Familiar
 A sparrow
 Im sorry I know this is not your preferred
form but it is only temporary until I get ten
more gold Lets go down and get some breakfast
 There he is He lands on Mollys horn
 On his horn yes
 Always Frumpkin yeah
 He flits over to Jesters horn Takes a
dump
 He stays there for the time being Is this
what were doing I cant go anywhere Im going
to be blind and deaf I have to stay still and
safe Try not hit me in the head with too many
things Itll take a while but he will go off
 Thats true as well
 I could have done a bat but its too late
for that now
 A bat
 I thought we talked about this You told
me and if you need to change it change it But
that I can only control him telepathically up to
 feet but could continue to see
 Im happy whatever your ruling is but
thats how weve done it
 Thats what I based this whole plan on
 The wording was a little squirrely
 So I can give him the command up close to
go but if anything happens I cant improvise with
him He does what the command is
 To fly north to the island and circle it a
few times to see what we can see and come back
 We gather in Fjord and Mollys room
 Ow
 Dont do that please Im trying to
concentrate
 That is a six plus very little or nothing
so you can guesstimate
 This is the bigger one
 Worse Five
 Does it look balder than the other
 Okay
 Last question I can probably tell how far
apart these two islands are yeah
  okay
 I feel that
 And it feels good
 You cant make me Vax again it wont work
 When I see that hes halfway back I come
out of it
 What are you doing
 I plant my hands on the sides of the wood
and start transmuting it to iron
 Hopefully it will dry
 But it brought us closer together
 Of course sorry Acid Wood There are two
islands out there a bigger one theyre not
close and a smaller one One is baldish a
couple of trees but I couldnt see too well on
either of them The bigger one is dense with
trees I didnt see them
 I thought that he would be able to see from
the air and I thought that would be safer
so no Im sorry
 I would have seen that
 Its not fleet week
 I think that the chances of finding it on
the big island are greater yes
 How far away roughly was the edge of the
lake and islands from where we are right now
 Okay so while everyone is preparing I take
out my spool of silver thread and I go first to
Jesters room and I stretch the thread across
and a little  flashes across
and the thread disappears It takes about ten
minutes each time and I do the same on Fjords
doorway stretch across  If
anyone goes in to these doors besides you I will
know but not when were on that island Only on
the way there Lasts about a mile
 Do you have any empty positions at the
circus for these two
 Tealeaf you said Its mostly an act
Whats the notmostly part
 Are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like
you
 Nott
 If thats what it is yeah
 Perhaps this girl Toya is his babys bottle
and then once in a while he wants an extra snack
 Fucking anime actors

 Well what are we doing
 Yes Im a good talker when I have to be
 Not for this
 Dungeons  Dragons is about punishment
 Were scouting the way nonchalantly I would
imagine
 We could make our way to the outskirts of
town
 No we can stay in the open I send Frumpkin
up into the air over the party  feet in the air
 So I take your hand and Im watching them
from above
 Im totally acting like I see everything
 Its badass
 I think perhaps the best thing to do is to
rent a boat not steal a boat
 Whats your idea
 All right
 No That ended We hear that theres
beautiful islands out in the middle of the
Ustaloch
 Ive never seen a lake before this one so
first island Its a very big moment for me
 Did you say piece of shite Whats the name
of the other one
 Crookedstone yeah
 I actually tagged along with them
 
 
 Did that make it in That was a nuke
 Are you kidding
 Thats big
 Were under the light of the moons
correct
 Moonlight at this point
 Hold on I send Frumpkin into the sky Look
down and see if now that I have him flying
closer maybe I can see better or see something
moving in this dim light before it goes
 Balls Thats a big seven
 Its too dark 
 No ranger
 Because I cant see anything Im going to
hand on your shoulder
 Do we want to do it like a Vformation with
Nott in the lead and the two humans just behind
 
 The bells have been deflowered
 Im sorry it was me
 No I meant Calebs stink
 Im moving slow on purpose at the back of
the group now
 Yeah this is like a famine home in Ireland
You can see the edges of it probably
 Ill pull out the Baba Yaga give me five
seconds
 Oh shit snacks
 Look youre up in the air bro
 I would be the furthest back
 Im at 
 So keep him with me
 Im human
 Were not holding hands anymore
 
 Put her in a body bag Johnny
 Question
 is the humans visibility shit
right now
 So I cant see what Im doing right
 Okay so four globules of light go 
out of my hands and one of them hovers
 Its a row of four globules of light One is
hanging above where my miniature is now One is
closer to froggy One is like a line over the
building so that theres one also hanging over
Beauregard
 With my remaining movement Im hauling ass
towards Fjord and whichever Jester that is ahead
of me
 So proud So proud
 From that blast Sick
 Nope thats a mistake You also dont mean
to do that
 Ooh it almost got me though
 
 Okay Plenty to spare
However he gains four temporary hit points
 What is this wisdom 
 Its your forte so
 Get back in there Rocky
 Knock her the fuck out
 As soon as it starts roaring I am
surrounded I have nowhere to go so I pull the
diamond out spin it and the ice shards start to
shoot and I pick it up and I throw it in his
bellybutton
 Thats okay because if I move I am dicked
Thats not good Thats terrible The second one
was so good though Thats not great Thats ten
 Im going to Nope Im going to stay there
and freeze Freeze up The cats a bird and she
flies up straight
 Deffo
 Yeah
 Thats a 
 Caleb is unconscious on the ground
 Jeez this is going south guys
 By the way when Caleb went down those four
balls of light disappeared
 Stay Maybe hell be distracted by fear
 Damn Were in a tight spot
 Success
 Hes going to fuck me up
 Travis wouldnt but Fjord would know
 Yes thats the threat
 You can get there and draw attention
 You can soak up damage
 In the dark
 Thats a success
 I have two successes Not that you know
that
 The dice dont give a shit
 Everyones like Hey hey hey
 Its like that video from Ireland Catch
it daddy
 Death save Fail
 Caleb goes  and I cast Dancing
Lights into the goblin and light her up Ah
 What the hell happened
 DM am I at one hit point at this moment It
was zero
 True loves kiss
 Yeah you know aint nothing 
 Oh
 Do you have any anything left in you
 Well okay
 Or we could just sit here for a bit and I
could catch my breath I think
 Man I got the full wizard experience
tonight
 Seven times
 Im really shabby at the moment
 Thats good Lets go back and talk to the
cops
 What about just its head
 Its all you blue
 The imps burned away
 Because thats what you want to stick your
finger in
 Caleb just retched into the grass from
watching that
 If it will help tomorrow or today what
time is it Its the middle of the night isnt it
 I know exactly what time it is dont I
Yeah
 Its something Ive always been able to
why is everybody looking at me like 
 
 How far away are they from the rest of us
 I was just about to suggest covering that
up but you know all cards on the table
 I pull Fjord away for a moment about ten or
 feet away This man in the boat has seen all of
you who are supposed to be under house arrest We
cannot have him talking to the authorities
 Jeez Come here
 Oh thats very trusting
 Oh youre here too now Great its a party
 Im not suggesting that but its either
violence or giving him a little something
 You want to leave it to chance
 Molly do you want to join this
conversation
 Walking up to the boat
 Collecting it as I go The thing of it is
weve just done Trostenwald what was that
Never mind a great service There was an unsavory element
did you know the circus was in town
Doesnt matter There was a bad fellow thats his head
with them Its no fault of theirs You pick weird folk up on the
road in the circus Isnt that right Mollymauk
 Thats going to rile you up Thats a bad
idea
 But the situation in town is a little
political Were going to take this thing out of
here and Im going to report it to the
authorities We dont really want to create a stir
and frighten people here I hope you will take
 Try to focus on the gold
 I think Fjord had a good idea which is if
you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again
you wait with it You guys get back to the tavern
yeah
 Now heres the thing I may be speaking out
of turn I know I dont know you very well but
it feels like the thing that we all share in
common here is that we dont wish to make maybe
not you make a big splash here
 Okay so maybe Im  to  percent correct
but were all in this together
 I dont want to make a big thing Im going
to go the authorities to my keen mind tells me
that womans name was
 Yeah the one who wanted to go eat
 Norda I want to go to her and citizens
arrest kind of thing Keep it quiet dont need
big accolades will take gold and then Ill bring
that back and we can divvy that up Thats no problem
 Right and if nobody recognizes you Do you
remember any of the guards that were in town that
you could make yourself look like specifically
 DM question The two zombified back at the
circus tents were they burnt to a crisp beyond
recognition
 Yeah but was he recognizable Did we leave
him looking like that dude at the end of The Last
Crusade after he drank from the wrong cup
 Okay Well the Jonas Brothers it is
friends
 They already believe that the circus is
terrible I think they were just going to confirm
their own suspicions
 Well thats a sticky situation Because
what if she talks about my friends who were there
with me
 It looks like she knows how to go off like a
siren
 Im at one hit point I understand
 Can you explain to us maybe your
relationship with Kylre If that was his name
 Lets talk about the killing part though
 Child how did you grow so close to him
 Did he communicate with you in some way
 What did you talk about
 I am sure this is painful for you You are
young Sometimes people we feel we know can be
someone else Regrettably this is one of those
instances He was a dangerous thing It is very
important that this is buried here You want to
travel on with the circus and with Mollymauk and
your friends That thing tried to kill us It did
kill things in Trostenwald Who knows what it
would have done to you child
 Oof
 No its not good
 It is only a six Rolled very low
 Rated T for Teen
 I talk to him while you do that You have
your wine you have your gold Thank you very
much it is much appreciated It was a lovely
trip
 Oh I have felled a beast
 You will not take credit for my kill I have
killed this thing and I want it to be watched I
am going to the authorities We will bring them
back and get this sorted
 Monster calves
 Yeah but at level two you need to roll
higher than a three
 That is correct Take her and sequester her
with the family so not a peep gets out
 Youre going to stay with your new friend
You cant come to
 Not this time Its not you know why
 If any problem should arise Ill send
Frumpkin straight away to you
 Im almost dead already
 Nott this is what I talked to you about the
other night These are our friends and were going
to sort this out and figure out what we do next
It has been you and me now it is you and me and
them Okay Youre with your blue friend here
 Ill be back Im just going to have a
conversation We have gotten out of prisons
before you and I Im not worried about that
 Well she was just holding the throbbing head
 I dont need to cause Im just taking a
stroll
 Yep thats my girl
 Look at him
 No Im not waiting Im going to see Norda
so Ill see you shortly Be ready
 Excuse me and I lurch and prop myself up
against a wall and push back Excuse me I just
had a very harrowing night
 You get me Norda this very minute and I will
tell you what has happened with this circus and in
this town and dont keep me waiting another
minute Im bleeding out here Arschloch
 Oh come on
 I wish I had gone with that because it was
great there but its not great here That is a nine
 Excuse me There are very good people being
held under house arrest in a tavern right now
They are innocent I have evidence that I can show
her This whole thing can be solved now
 Okay I look him in the eye I will go away
Get the message to her that the head of the circus
frog is at the docks waiting for her inspection
 I remember the height
  There is a circus toads remains
at the docks I would like to put this towns
fears to rest I am looking for Whats her name
Yorda
 Norda Yordas at the inn Right
 Liams memory is really spotty but Calebs
is rocksolid
 Thank goodness Thank you gentlemen
Forgive me I can see that youre trying to get
yourself home to bed
 You are very aware that there are people at the
Nestled Nook under house arrest by your order
They are innocent and I can prove it and I would
like to end things as quickly as possible I have
killed one of the circus folk this evening
 Funny story Yes these are the people I was
talking about Nothing has changed however and I
am only asking to take another ten minutes of your
time to walk to the dock One of the performers
has been killed this evening and I have done it
I staked out the circus because my friends were in
trouble and wrongly accused and I knew this So
I staked out the circus this evening and watched
as this toad thing left the grounds there It did
this to me and I in a rage followed it and
destroyed it and I will show you the remains of
my work Well put it to bed Im either a clown
or Im a toadkiller Lets see what it is
 Come on you fucker
 
 You know thats probably agitating the
issue Lets go to the docks
 Im good with these terms Follow me
please
 I am not going to answer her Im just
walking very firmly with purpose to the docks
 Moment of confusion here it is right
here where I left it Nobody has tampered with
it I turn around and I pull back my clothing and
this It was done by this thing 
 It is as bad as it looks and if you have
any holy people in this city they will confirm
that this thing is fiendish
 I hope you dont believe that I slashed open
my own body and then went to the police
 I sit down on a crate and I stop talking
 No its good that you try so hard to
protect the rights of giant frog creatures Im
very impressed
 Just me
 Yes it was difficult but I prevailed in the
end The city is safe What library was that that
you mentioned
 Here in town
 Oh sorry one last thing Watchmaster I
pull out the book that I read about the nergaliid
Here this is a gift for you This is folklore
You will find I have marked a page in there It
will describe this thing
 Its just a pot
 Youre the little girl here Youre
confused Its been a night
  Breaking the law breaking the
law
 Well first a question Are you familiar
with Occams Razor
 I figured Okay That one works for the
circus Do I look like I work for the circus
 No Im a dirty hobo and I reek like
yesterdays garbage
 Yeah This one does he look like a circus
performer Is he filthy like me
 But hes right here Look I can touch him
 The sardonic one right With the
shiteating grin Does she look like she works for
the circus
 I am injured within a centimeter of my life
This one is a nincompoop
 Thats you I pull the mask away This is my
good friend Shes a goblin
 I step in front of her She is my friend and
colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while
I am standing here
 Fucking right I will
That is an 
 Level two
 Shes looking into my chest because Nott is
behind me Im sorry Im confused why youre
going to such lengths to defend the rights of this
large oversized frog skull
 Theres a big conspiracy to make undead
crownsguard here in the city
 You know when shes nervous she aerates her
bladder all right
 Still sucks
 I invite Nott up to my piggyback position
on my shoulders
 I scoop her up
 Just let it happen
 Can I have my book back please
 How much do you think the circus has
 What happens to the circus because you know
you cant do the same show for the same people for
a year
 We dont know we didnt see him
 Yeah were just like tieflings were all
alike
 Well if it is this thing that weve read
about in the book then perhaps he needed to feed
more or was impatient for some reason
 And Im sorry are we also taking the
bouncer into our little coven of weirdos Is that
a thing thats happening
 Im too tired to argue Lets get that
drink
 That is a very sick burn
 I catch Notts eye and silently mouth the
word lunatics
 A what
 They generally run from crystals Ive seen
that kind before
 Yeah theres no balloons though Whats a
balloon
 Oh a dirigible Dirigible Ive heard of
but a balloon I dont know what that is
 You dont know
 You know just out of curiosity whats
everybody plan to do now
 You were never wanted Back to my
question
 Straight there
 Yeah Took the words out of my mouth
 I dont know You know Nott and I have been
travelling together for a while and two is better
than one although still very difficult
 Uh you know it was six months ago
about Five six months ago
 Ill do persuasion
 Thats uh I dont know where on my
character sheet is Thats also a 
 Well first of all shes being modest It
was not just me at all I could not have gotten
out of there without you I dont think you could
have gotten out of there without me either but you
know
 Thats why I said two Better than one One
is the loneliest number
 Yeah
 You know normally I wouldnt feel
comfortable talking about shit like this but you
are all very shifty
 No no no youre shifty as well Yeah
 No nothing serious at all really I was
too curious She was maybe a little thirsty You
know petty stuff
 We all know how this country works
 
 You know I wouldnt go west maybe
 Yeah and theyre pretty terrible in the
north Thats no secret
 Mollymauk youre comfortable leaving the
circus You are very you have a lot of flair
 That doesnt make any sense at all
 I mean it does but it blatantly obvious and
simplistic

 I mean technically this is a group You
mean groups bigger than this group or is this
group too claustrophobic for you or 
 Yeah
 
 Yeah Im good thank you

 Do we have time to look at this were
making plans with friends thats amazing Do we
have for errands in the morning I have a couple
stops Nothing major
 Yeah
 Way up after Nott has gone I go over to
Norda Is Norda down there
 No theres two people with rhyming names
 This is revenge for Vex and Vax
 I find the purveyor of the establishment
 Mork from Ork thats what I said
 Excuse me is there I know you have a bath
here but is there a hot bath place like a
bathhouse Im bruised over every inch of my body
and Im in a lot of pain
 I know but how much are we talking about
 Thats expensive
 Northward you say
 Okay good
 Im not worried
 Danke And I head up there
 The writing only shows up if you throw it in
fire

 Im sure everything went according to plan
 Ah
 
 Is this one of those dreams where nobody has
their clothes on
 Well you know this is very fascinating
but I have some errands to run Nott would you
like to run errands with me We are totally coming
back and not leaving on our own undercover
 Bring it on
 Persuasion
 I rolled a natural  Whatever Im being
very honest Were not going anywhere But I do
have errands to run So were going to leave
soon Have some breakfast I grab some bacon from
FordFjords plate and grab Nott and head out the
door
 I have two places to go The first were
going to the Burnished Bibelots The second is a
surprise But I know that I whisked you away in a
hurry the other day and you werent done
browsing
 Maybe thats the third place that we go I
will point out your point which was that these
crazy bastards are very distracting and strange
yeah
 So they could be my healing potion you
know Well talk about it Third place So drag
her off to the Burnished Bibelots Boom in the
door
 Good day to you sir
 I give Nott a little shove over towards the
shelves and walk up to him right up to the
counter What are you eating there That looks
good
 All right yeah Thats what that is You
know I wanted to thank you for the book I dont
know if you read it yourself but I read it cover
to cover quickly It was fascinating and very
useful 
 I hope youre doing stuff over there
 Well heres the thing I have read this
book and loved it and if you would like to
purchase it for the low low price of one gold
you can sell it again You sold it to me for
three You have it back for one You can turn a
profit
 Natural 
 That is a good decision and it was a good
book I am grateful for the knowledge you have
imparted upon me
 Oh of course Its right here on the table
Sorry grandfather
 Right You will not sell that back to me
for sure
 Thats a good price Nott how are you
doing
 All done for the day
 What is that little dancer toy Between the
three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you is
that a music box there
 Its lost the magic
 How long would that take
 Okay Well Ill come back and see your work
in three days Work on that and your breakfast
Hey Nott are you ready
 All right Good day to you Happy sales
 Sure Out the door
 Im going to head in the direction dragging
my goblin friend with me to that fancy bathhouse
that was described to me last night at the Nestled
Nook
 Charisma check Well something I wanted to
do before we got there was going to do it maybe
in an alley but you tell me is I would like to
cast Disguise Self on myself Presumably gone into
an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the
middle of the road I take the form of a man in
very fancy green robes beautiful blond hair very
handsome man with a vomit stain down the front of
my clothes
 I drag my little friend along with me You
are going to like this this is something very special
 Oh charisma check Straight charisma
 Yeah its 
 Dew dew Theres a liquid u in that
 All right lets enter this establishment
 Yes one moment  Stay close to me
and let me do the talking  Hello please
dont focus my daughter is shy
 Ive had a terrible day Some disgusting
derelict has vomited all over me I smell like
filth and I would like to spend a couple of hours
in your finest bath Maybe not your finest A good
bath for a couple of hours My daughter and I I
will need adjoining baths if you have that For
modestys sake my daughter and I
  Theres a 
 Thats fine I definitely have that I take
out the eight silver I slap it down
 Okay Come along dear
 Yes it is
 Thats meine Liebchen Im hoping for a hot
bath for the both of us It has been a long bit of travel
 Are they separate though
 Excellent This is called a bath
 A hot bath We have been pretty dinged up
for the past several months and we might not get
back into something like this for a while so I
want you to enjoy it Go over to your side and I
will be here Nott Im going to do a bit of
reading
 Yes
 Yes I will be the same Caleb
 Trust me I will not
 Once she is clear of the wall Im going to
start actually disrobing although I guess the
illusion stays
 Nott Im probably going to go quiet for a
little while
 Enjoy it I find the second book and examine
it Am I able to read this
 So All my actual clothes are off Im going to
take the book and set it on the edge of the basin
 I set it down I sit with just my legs in
the bath for a moment and I look at the book

 On my side while all of that is happening
two things One is that when I finally get into
the tub I dip my whole body almost entirely in
but not my head or hair Letting the bruises soak
in the hot water which feels wonderful The
second thing is while flipping the pages of this
book very still I can hear all of this and it
is extremely endearing but I go completely still
Completely quiet And read in peace
  Why 
is this crowbar seven gold
 Shut the front door
 I pack up I said were staying for an
hour so I cast Disguise Self again to
keep the illusion going Im done you look
 refreshed
 Did you like it though
 I wanted to repay you for all youve done
for me for the past couple of days
 The brief moment that I was in my own guise
nothing changed up here so I look exactly the way
I did this morning
 Who said that You wanted to do something
right
 Lets do that then You lead the way Well
wait you lead the way outside Lets keep our
little schtick going here and then off we go
 Yes but we have to go Sorry Im late for
a very important appointment I drag Nott right
out of here because I saw no doorknob on the
door
 Sorry I will say that on the way there
that I dropped the disguise somewhere
 All right Marisha said that not
Beauregard
 Thats a slam dunk at level two
 This guy went from the Simpsons Safeway
clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap of
time because of your question
 Yes can I help you good sir Yes I can
help you
 You fucking badass
 Whats the matter do you have a cold
 I will take that as a compliment thank you
What are you guys doing here are you shopping
What do they have in there
 How much do they run for
 
 We have a plan for the day
 Do you have a strategy for that
 Which one would that be Because I was
thinking about it on the walk here and I cant
think which one applies
 No I wouldnt be saying this out loud if
youre close
 Heres the thing I have died almost twice
in two days We have our friends and I think
thats a good way to start
 I mean you know we almost all got pinched
yesterday
 You and me
 All right Okay where are we going first
 Is it this big
 How far off does Hupperdook look
 Do I have any knowledge of Alfield
 Will you share your map with me for just
one minute
 It looks like somebody was very nice to you
the night before over and over again
 Sure lets do that Whats our goal in
Zadash
 Unless youre a foreigner everyone knows
about Rexxentrum
 Zadash is medium or smaller
 How far did that map say when I looked
at it  miles you said to Zadash
 Well I think its good
 How many horses
 A couple of weeks on the road to a city
bigger than this one
 Two weeks is not a bad test run for
companions If we dont like it we part ways in Zadash
 You have something else to do
 While everyone is getting ready I wait for
a moment when Fjord is on his own and everyone is
busy walk over This group seems rough around the
edges but you seem clever Hopefully we can make
this work
 I mean full disclosure Im a little rough
around the edges but you catch my drift
 Lets make it work
 Yeehaw
 Oh my gosh and Sneaky McSneakerson over
here Oh boy
 Bunch of assholes
 Thats the name
 Except when he doesnt
 I would also like a donut please
 Do you actually have donuts I dont
understand
 Oh there it is
 Are they pretty new
 Three days new Or Forget it I dont
actually want to know the answer
 Mollymauk is this weird for you to not be
traveling with your performing family
 Some things dont change We didnt have
much of a chance to see you perform I saw you do
a card reading for Jester but things got waylaid
at the circus What do you normally do
 If anybody can do it its you
 How far away are they
 Yeah I send Frumpkin ahead and see it and
go blind and deaf here so I can get a closer look
at them
 Frumpkins a sparrow at the moment I dont
have the components to put him back to the shape
he prefers which is a cat
 Charcoal and some incense a kind of incense
you have to use Im all out I used it all
 No
 Money Well you have to pay money to get
the things to do it
 Hes been a couple of things before He can
last Anyway Off you go
 Dont fuck me Scanlan Oh thats not
Scanlan thats Percy but you did fuck me Percy
 That is very low Well just say it fails
because its a two
 Yeah I rolled a two
  horses
 I started muttering as soon as I could see
that What they were what I saw
 I wouldve released it yeah Hes not back
but I released the sight
 Perception check
 Zwlf
 Wakka wakka
 Thats a pretty big matzo ball there
 Yeah but I would ask Are you asking
because that is something that you have no
experience with or are you wondering maybe is that
something that we could join you in
 Mostly whatever we can walk away with
 Always go for a sure thing
 No we should take it off the road
 Where are you going to do
 Okay I have a bird that can go probably
higher than the tree if you want
 Would you like me to do that
 Or you could I dont want to rob you of the
joy of climbing a good tree
 Okay Well I will sit in the field then and
give him a little chuck under the chin and oh
wait Before I go away am I looking for anything
specific
 People coming
 They do As the bird is flying just for a
you but hes a cat almost all the time so this
is a rarity Youll be able to climb many trees
many other times but we should take advantage of
him Well okay
 Feel it I can feel stuff
 We worked out that he could okay great
Theres bugs in my nose
 Shove it all in everybody
 In the middle of the field you hear
 Ooh
look at that What do I see
 Thats a nine
 Okay I keep flying for a little bit
longer
 The treant eats you
 How cold is it out
 Now hold on I pull a rag out and I 
one of the Dancing Lights and make that hooded
lantern again so that you can see
 While they decide that Im going to pull
out my silver thread and Im going to start
winding a foot circle around the fire
 Everybody hears a little  as I hit a
little bell that I have thats part of it
And thats it
 I will stay up for a little bit yeah
 Oh thats pretty good Thats a 
 Am I the only one awake at this moment
 I slowly jiggle Nott awake  Get
up
 I put a hand over her mouth
 There is a thing out around our fire a ways
off
 No I saw the shape Its not dark theres
a fire here
 Because we want them to die I think we
should probably wake everyone
 I shake Beau awake
 She said most beautiful Theres a thing
out there in the field Something is moving
 No wait here
 As soon as I see her do that I start
swatting Fjord on the back to wake him up
 Im so proud I dont know that spell so I
cannot talk back
 What Who said that If you can can hear
me I dont think you can come back with the group
 Is that how Message works
 For one round so six seconds
 Oh if its a cantrip you can do it over
and over again
 Its two soup cans with a string
 Is she back
 I scoop her up Look at you You cast a
spell you spoke to me
 Its as simple as that isnt it
 Oh Im so proud of you We need to calm
down and go back to bed
  Got you
 No I thought we were all going to die but
it was just what was it
 Echoes in the field 
 Well shit I guess were going to look
at a buffalo
 
 Silently ruffle Notts hair on the way back
to camp
 Turd watch
 Are you okay Were fine Everythings
good
 You would tell us if something was wrong
 Can you speak
 You just spit a lot of water out and you
were sleeping
 I dont I want to make an insight check 
Hes talking about acid reflux but he just spit a
bunch of water out
 Yeah okay Thats 
 Does he seem full of shit to me
 Is our group going to be all about puns and
that stuff
 Yeah
 How long ago was that
 What about the sword You said you found it
on the ocean you found on the boat you were on
You were on an island What do you mean
 DM when I cast Detect Magic in the first
game in the tavern did that sword light up
 I dont even need to touch it but would you
trust me to study it for a moment
 Im good at figuring things out Im
clever
 Ja you can understand that we would be
curious but I dont want to push anybody I mean
weve just met
 When he says he doesnt quite understand is
he telling the truth Is that the same insight check
 
 You wouldnt have to remember that far back
You said that this all started just a few weeks
ago when you met this one
 I was wondering the very same thing
actually all night I was wondering what we would call
 You were going to butcher at Winters
Crest and thats a special treat
 Have I ever read about it
 I pull Nott over Do you know what WC
means in Zemnian
 Toilet
 I give her a little fistbump
 Vasquez
 Must be nice
nice
 How does that affect us again
 Did that look arcane to me
 Is it a walledin city or just parts here
and there
 Not fortified at all
 We leave the toilet behind and we run in
 I would be pressed against the wall of that
house
 Okay so I have advantage on stealth
 Thank you
 
 Maybe amble more than dash
 I mutter a few words and my form starts to
blink in and out of view There is another Caleb
next to me and another Caleb next to me Shifting
blinking flashing back and forth and its hard to
see where I am
 Yeah it is
 The old fashioned swirly kind
 Oh schei
 That was worse
 That was already bad
 Mmhmm
 Its all part of the plan
 Yeah
 Whatd you get
 Oh all together at last
 Mercerful
 GNOLL
  GNOLL
 Bobobobo bobobo
 At the bitch who attacked you
 Yeah okay I will move along the table over
here to this spot
 I think I have a clear view of the big gnoll
correct From there
 I mutter a few arcane words under my breath
and a circle of flame spins around my hand and
three beams of fire shoot out towards this big
guy I cast Scorching Ray Each one is a separate
attack First one is a 
 Second one is also a  the third one is a

 So d on him
 Because they all hit Thats four six
 Nine Thats the six
 This one
 Oh thank you  Thats a total of
 fire damage on him
 I probably have ten feet of movement which I
would like to use to move back to where I was and
try to not hyperventilate against the back of this
building
 Dead center Yeah Okay Good
 No Im like this Im doing this
 She doesnt give a shit about that bear
 Apologies to my friend
 So sorry guys There you go
 Were losing subscribers in Europe
right now
 Halt den Mund
 Okay I start moving back towards the same
vantage point I had before and I see Jester above
me and I see a guy over there covered in ice and
I whip around and the diamond comes up and I go
 and I was about to make it acid but
theres ice everywhere so its ice now Chromatic
Orb off to the big guy in the middle of town
square yeah
 It misses entirely
 Then I use the rest of my movement to press
my back against the wall and go nein nein nein
 Still behind the same building
 Get out of the city
 Okay Im just going to do my same dog and
pony show trick Im going to go to the corner I
should be able to see two or three gnolls I
think over there yeah
 Okay so  starts to burn in my
hand Chromatic Orb out to hit whichever one
 Then thats the one Im going to go for
Come on Oh thats good Thats a 
 Thanks Keyleth
 That is d so where is my eightsided die
There it is This is fire and it is  points of damage
 Okay and I inch back again and say
 If it aint broke dont fix it And
hide behind the building
 I would like to think that he does laugh
hideously and despises himself for it
 Doves go everywhere
 Swing it high Beau
 Swing away
 All his friends are running away and hes
going Me and my friends are going to kill you
 Yeah
 If hes still around when shes done I
would have done my same single
 Yeah
 No I would have leaned out if I had seen it
was dead and no enemies I would use my
movement my action to move further up to the
corner not much besides that but join where
Fjord and the duplicate are Thats it
 Nott
 This is simultaneous
 Its dark too
 You beat me to it You said  minutes went
by I wanted us to be doing that already
 I was just waiting for you to pause
 Thats fine
 Id like to think that we leaned down to the
same gnoll cutting and went same hat Same hat
 We have seen these things as far south as
Trostenwald Further even
 I have a question After listening to this
for a while I start looking around the town would
you say that with all these burnt buildings
everywhere that if I start picking through the
rubble I would find enough charcoal to reduce
the costs I would need for Find Familiar
eventually Because I still need the incense and
the herbs but if I get a lot of charcoal from these
burnt homes
 Yeah
 Yeah done and done Thats good and I have
a good investigation too That is a 
 Yeah good thats good
 Ive already got the silver thread out and I
am looping it over any open window and by the door
 Youre not the only one Caleb is going
 one
gold two gold three gold  gold
 This was a good idea
 We are hitching out stars to your wagon

 She just shot some Sun Chip out of her
mouth Youre welcome internet
 Nein
 I wrote Rod Barn
 What is a bloodline
 You got to the circus from that how
 Thats funny you gave me an answer but you
didnt really give me an answer
 Do we think theres anything left of this
town
 I would like to take a walk and see what it
is were out to save
 Maybe we do that second and first we take a
walk
 We did but Molly was drinking so maybe he
does not remember
 I counted  gold
 I dont remember that either
 Well my social anxiety is getting the best
of me Im taking a walk Goodbye
 Its a Zork game We go down the stairs
 Excuse me I saw in the middle of the fray
Sir Excuse me
 Im sorry I was part of the fray as well I
was right in the thick of it I saw a cart piled
high with bodies Are there people missing from
town
 How has the rest of the village fared Is
everything as poorly off as you are
 Is yours the only business that was hit
 Im sorry Mollymauk another question for
standing but a supply store
 Im sorry Im in the need of some incense
 Also Im sorry just between you and me I
know the look on your face a little bit you seem
a little manic If you have friends you can stay
with right now you know you dont have to rebuild
it today I recommend you take it slow
 To the Broad Barn
 So you wish to hire us How much We are
very experienced but wed like to know what were
talking about in advance What kind of money are
we talking about
 Is there some lesser number for those
 It is permissible is what theyre saying
here
 Could you tell us at least what the
landscape is like in that direction what is over there
 This comes from research you have done that
you have read up on Would you be able to share
this reading with me so that we are fully
prepared
 Just a small book
 With a Y Yeenogru
 Sorry another question May I call you
Bryce
 Bryce We were just about to go inside the
barn here and get outfitted for this for many
things but especially now that we are going to go
take care of this problem Do you have any sort of
pull with these people Might we get any
friendly
 No Well sure but Im talking about some
sort of discount for getting ready for the road
Were not that flush
 Its asking a bit much I was too forward
 Yes
 Sorry my curiosity gets the best of me
always You are talking about buff buffaro
creatures or something We saw these beasts on
the outskirts of town They look brownfurred
beast of burdentype creature Do you know what
those animals are
 Valley aurochs Got it thank you All
right we should get ready for the road Walking
into the store
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Well that would be worth about how much
DM
 A pack or something
 That is really very
 Yes this has helped me immeasurably
 Well it depends on how much I want to do
with it I want my cat back But I was in the
realm of  or  gold Im going to spend here
today if they have that much
 Did anyone say that out loud
 Its not quantity It is the quality of
the incense And this was topshelf but I still
you big guy And I punch him and I walk in
 Keep up a good face for two seconds
 Excuse me I just inhaled my own spit
  I am okay 
I am needing a very fine kind of incense and I
dont know if that is the type of thing this
establishment would carry but its very
important Do you have that sort of thing
 Im sorry its very noisy in the shop What
did you say
 Well look at me Can you not tell how fancy
I am
 Well You know Ive been on the road a long
time and Im carrying a smell with me if you
cannot tell
 To the point I like it I would like to
spend about  gold worth of incense Do you have
that much I dont mean cheap shit
 Well its a barn ja
 I would like to make an insight check to
make sure its not oregano
 Come on wheres the druid Thats what
would be for oregano Thats Vex This one
 Perception
 Insight Oh thats much better That is an
elf
 Elf  You just learned something
everybody Its  in German
 Good This is really good I will give you
 gold for all this
 One Two 
 
  And I push the  gold forward
 These are heavy
 Is it flammable Do I know if its
flammable
 Nott youre selling yourself short
 No I have things to do
 Well I would really like to get my cat
back so I would need about an hour to go do a
little stuff Do you have anything else to do
 What are we doing Are we taking our cart
 Well okay Maybe I can put it on hold
although I really hate to But lets come up with
what are we doing What is the plan
 Oh so were you thinking of having a
barbecue here or setting up a barbecue on the road
 Just a random field
 Either way we will probably need the
cart
 To carry one of those beasts if we kill
one
 Well is the point to try to Im sorry no
you finish your thought
 Im not a tactician but I have a question
 Are we trying to go back to these things where they
live Their lair their home their camp Or are
we hoping to luck into them on the road or
 I like that idea as well
 Well thats the thing We can do both but
there is a timestamp on the people We should take
care of the people first Because then were
increasing how much gold we will bring in because
if they die then we will not get as much money for
them if they are alive We should get them alive
Get them out Kill the baddies if we can at the
same time and if not go back a second time
 No social graces Lets do this
 Wait so now we need time
 Oh god I really want my cat but maybe
 Well get the tarts Maybe it would be
handier as a bird
 Reggie this town has been hit hard you
look very weary and maybe a little down on your
luck yourself Maybe Im just reading into things
but I would gladly pay you a silver for this horse
 Heres that copper Thank you
 Silvers way too little for a horse
 They dont care theyre swinging low and
leaving it behind
 As we go and also we didnt have time so
here off you go I will sit in the cart and go blind
 The last one
 Frumpkin would be in the air  feet in
front of the cart and I wouldnt do  of the
time but I would talk for three minutes and then maybe
come back So intermittent
 Seven
 Also in this time I would have told the
Trostenwald just outside the city limits we were
waylaid by gnolls previously and they were hiding
in grass just like this It was very much like
this so we should be Im getting very nervous
right now looking at it all
 You know I know its actually about 

so were not quite there yet By the position of
the sun
 Beholder
 Walking on the ground as a human is it up
to here or
 Youve seen Teen Wolf ja
 Here goes all Jesters teeth
 Come on roll a  Make it happen
 I would like to use Frumpkin to do a
oncearound from above to see if any of those
beasts are on the horizon anywhere for us to kill
and also if there are any survivors or anything here
 That is a 
 From  feet up I can see through
Frumpkins eyes all of us being a bunch of dumb
fucks in the back of the cart
 The crew The crew groaned
 Disgust
 I was waiting for the punchline
 Id like to point out that we came up with a
loose plan but were not doing that plan
 Also in a pinch we could kill the horses
  I cant do that

 How about we dont make any noise at all
but we just sneak in
 I will also help with that
 Okay Lift with the legs
 Do we have the time for that right now
 Right now it will take me  minutes to do
that
 Were coming in as a line together
 I dont want to be on an end I dont want
you to be on the end
 I would grab Nott by the shoulder and pull
us into the middle somehow
 Yes
 
 Those monster calves
 I think theyre going to make a big fucking
stink if we
 That is correct
 I will send Frumpkin down to the one that
Jesters attacking right up against it to
distract and chirp in its face
 Caleb sends Frumpkin right down to the
one that Jester was attacking and I will send out
a Fire Bolt at the same time
 Thats at advantage if my birdie is
bothering him up close
 Yeah the one that Jester is attacking
 That is oh thats good That is 
 These spells are all still new to me Oh thats a
big one
 Big one point of damage
 Yep  to a three
 Shes like Miss Trunchbull from Matilda
 Theres just the carts theres the one mine
entrance
 Ill take a look around to see if theres
anything where they started or anything like that
 
 But well remember it for the future
 How about whats behind the grass lets
discuss this instead
 Sorry I was thinking about a thing you were
saying there is a way through for us
 I mean that is a fair assumption yeah
 Well were talking
 Jesus
 That was good
 Do not be sorry
 Frumpkin has been a sparrow before Sparrows
dont have darkvision do they
 No it is a regular sparrow
 Well I mean I can send him in there hell
probably hit the wall a few times but if theres
any fire or anything
 No you know I can always bring him back
but be careful all right But there he goes
 
 Yeah I am
 Is that from a light source inside or from
sunlight coming in
 Please no
 Okay well I think I have seen all I am
going to see for the moment but I didnt see
anything in there
 Nothing living in there that I saw
 Okay Nott my friend I think maybe this is
a time where you could please dont go crazy
but maybe go in  or  feet theres a room in
there and I dont think theres anything in
there but you would see
 I can hear through my sparrow
 Thats correct Richtig Go
 Wait I dont want to get punched in the
face while Im blind Somebody please put a hand
on my shoulder
 If something bad is going to happen just
shake me
 No dont do that just shake me
 Dont do that just
 You are a wee baby rogue
 Oh shit
 Ive heard a confusing thing Something fell
down but okay were good
 Help me help me now save my life We have
to go in Here we go
 Wait so the whole party ran in
 As that was happening the two humans in
tandem said Wait let them draw out their fuck
 Are we doing initiative or are we just
going
 Dancing Lights
 Four globules of light Dancing Lights The
room is lit up
 As youre looking Im going to pull all the
Dancing Lights down to one and put the rag over it
and walk beside Beau so that she can see
 Come on you people We need a corner and a
camera for the corner and a long paper hat for
you to put you in the corner
 Okay thats okay Thats Scheie where did it
go Over here DD Beyond It is ten Yeah I
rolled very low
 Does the rod look like crudely made or
prettily designed
 Okay no carving no glyphs no nothing like
that just caked in shit
 Okay
 Have a peekypoo around as you go
 You know she does this from time to time
she becomes a little unpredictable but you cant
argue with the results you really cannot
 You cant tell me what I can do Matthew
 For keeping things alerting us of things
coming here or
 Yeah thats a good suggestion First what
are we doing What did you find out down that way
 I think we should also send you down that
one as well to have a look around
 How far down did you go each way
 Well my instinct tells me that if theres
something there that they would trap it so
probably more valuable if were going on nothing
take the path that is trapped
 These are dog people Lets take the path
with the trap
 Down the wooden shaft
 You can see in the dark
 Ten
 
 Did you describe any light source in here
that theyre working by
 Got it
 The one that got thrown into the wall It
got stunned or hurt it didnt get any
  Here we go
 The hyenas are just doggos
 What about the boom stick that you have We
can chuck it into the
 Yes it would but
 Where would you want this distraction to be
Because I can make a little
 I can make a little dancing golden person of
light appear down at the bottom of the passage
 If theres more in there theyre just going
to come in here anyway
 Heres the question
 do you think these
things are going to come out of here right away
or is it worth a shot Maybe there is a way
around to a way theyre not expecting
 You know theres nothing saying we have to
run in here if were not feeling this We can
backtrack and look in the other direction In
fact Im leaning that way
 Plus we do have a map here
 Use DD
 I can make a little golden person dance
behind that guy there
 AoE Surprise round What are you talking
about
 What is your thing
 Not right now no But its like that
 its easy this one
 Do that
 Im going to start throwing up again soon
so lets either do this or backtrack please
 Are we going right now
 Are you about to go
 Im going to really quickly mutter a few
arcane words then there is another Caleb blinking
in front of me a little bit and behind me a little
bit It is hard to see me at the moment
 I dont care
  A little halflingsized person of
light appears behind the gnoll at the far end there
 Im using Dancing Lights You can use the
four lights to make a little person a little
humanoid shape of light It is doing a little
macarena behind the gnoll all the way I have 
feet of range
 Yes it is But I would know that Im not
going to do that because of my keen memory that
Caleb has but not Liam
 I send Frumpkin through the chamber and down
and starts battering into the walls here
 Oh Im sure that hits Yeah
 The effect of that hasnt taken place yet
correct
 Did Fjord hit one successfully
 That same one I am just going to Fire Bolt
it From yeah yeah
 Fire Bolt That is an attack range guy
plus six that is a  to hit
 The damage is seven
 Ill use my movement to back up about 
feet just outside of the chamber
 Rogue best class
 I hope we at least heard the Looney Tunes
bongos 
 Yeah I can see from where I am I can see
Fjord and Beau with one of these things Im going
to Fire Bolt right from where I am
 Thats it Aw no
 Sorry
 Yeah I will walk just inside the
 Jester is the lollipop the flat kind or the
round kind
 Thats the best
 I saw Nott dart in front of me and chuckle
to myself see Nott walk past Im going to walk
but okay Can I see these two You said they were
backing away correct
 All right then the diamond comes up I spin
it and little charges of electricity crackle
around it and I kick it out from my hand and it
spirals through the room to that one
 Come on Grog No
 Two Plus six is eight did that do it
 Nein
 But I was so eager that I actually came down
the steps my full movement
 I dont want to go there I want to go to
the bottom of the steps behind Mollymauk and Fjord
 Im going to go along the edge of the steps
this way and come down toward it and Im going to
now spin and flames lick around it and Ill go
 and I flick that off my hand This time is
also not good It is a 
 Oh For my attack
 Same thing Rolled the same thing
 No its okay No I dont believe in any of
that bullshit You all are crazy
 No dont worry about me Keep going
Everybody attack
 Two and a three
 Never recover from that injury
 You are going to be rubbing Tiger Balm into
that shit for years
 As the room falls still I say
 Well he had
a good run A toast to that guy right there on the ground
 Im going to call Nott over to the chest
over on that side there Do you see anything wrong
with this Is there anything hinky about that
chest
 Its investigation I think
 Does it look good
 Take a step back Youve earned this I will
open it just in case
 Oh
 Well thats probably true Thank you You
take the two medicine packs and then
 She can heal without the potion
 Of course she can
 There was a lot of gnoll chatter in here
and a lot of exploding orbs and stuff so Im
going to guess that we have alerted whatever is
beyond that we are here How do we wish to proceed
 They dont send orbs of fire through the
air though
 Are you clear now
 How many fingers am I holding up
 And thumbs Or

 You good Do we need to get out of here
 I dont think I mean yeah we could
but
 No were still trying to get to people
here Our options are we press forward to
something worse or we backtrack and try the other
direction or we get out of here
 Did we No we opted not to do that for
times sake
 Yeah we could do that now
 Yeah I could do that quickly I could put
an Alarm here quickly I could do it the fast way
and know if anything is coming behind us Is that
what we want to do Do we want to go around I
dont know Im a little terrified of what is down
there
 Thats a half hour is a short rest Or an
hour is a short rest
 Theres two ways that I can do this I can
do it licketysplit or I can take my book out and
do it the harder way but thats ten minutes
about
 We just have to march into it Okay
 How are you with that sledgehammer on your
back
 Youre carrying a sledgehammer on your
back
 How are you with it
 No we dont have time for that here We
have to get going
 When were victorious we can do disgusting
things as we leave Nott I think you should take
point again
 That I thought that was for going back the
other way We want to know if something comes
behind us
 The reasons for doing that are slighter and
I dont want to blow my wad magically
 If we were going the other way I might
 We talked for seven minutes yeah
 Why are you curious about that
 That is the crux of the matter
 Its like a tip jar
 Teen Titans Go plays Grimlock on
Transformers all over the place
 Its her psychic power
 Well
 From our vantage point it is the entrance
that were at and then there is doors to the
left
 I will be at the rear
 I will also do that as well following suit
with everybody
 Oh okay
 Great How about Nott
 I have rolled a nine
  Regular gnoll regular gnoll
 Thats it Just nine and regular gnoll
thats all that we have Thats campaign two
ladies and gentlemen
 It cancelled out your advantage Its just a
straight roll and you lost the sneak attack
 Welcome friend Welcome
rolled ladies and gentlemen
 Its a one
 One of us One of us

taking this
 Storytelling
 Get back to me in a second in about nine
seconds
 Now taking the stage its Mollymauk
 I cannot see anything so I cast Dancing
Lights I put one above my head and as soon as I
get a little bit of light I send one over Beaus
head and then I send one about  feet beyond Beau
and then the fourth one even beyond that one so
theres a line of four lights because I dont know
what the chamber is shaped like
 You know Matthew the guiding lights those
little foomphs of light they only have a
foot radius so probably the edges of the line
that I have cast just barely makes it flame
 Of course It is of course pretty Never
mind just continue
 Oh Fuck that I will stay where I am No
thank you
 Did you hear the sound go highpitched
yell So its not ten feet its big
 Its a constitution save
 
 Thunderwave is d Yeah d there You
want the one thats shaped like a diamond Here it
is Yeah Thats good and then roll one more time
Oh thats good
 Oh look at that fucking miniature
  Careful the kids you pull
 I cannot see anything except for Fjord so
if I move forward up to where he is am I able to
see any gnolls or any other kind of baddies where
I am
 Then Ill let my hand blacken and I will
fire off a Fire Bolt at him from here Which Im
sure will miss Yeah it is It misses

 I turn to Fjord as it misses and say
 Eh
yeah

 I have them theyre right here
 I need an intelligence bump is what I need
Boomp
 What do you mean
 I have a very high AC Its okay
 Unload it give it to me
 No dont find a positive
 No actually that hurts an awful lot
 You ganked him at the last second
 Well dont we send a lot of them down the
hole We didnt get their ears So bad job
 It is very dark in here what kind of bird
is that you have
dark midnight hummingbird
 Yes handle this child but then were very
curious to ask a couple Ill shut up
 Yeah what do you look like
 Are you a gray fox is that what you are
I mean hes a striking character Hes got three
dimples one you cant see Two are pretty deep in
his face and can be menacing unless hes
smiling
 Meanwhile everyone is talking to this
stranger Im going to edge up to this hole in the
ground and hold onto rocks because Im scared to
death Look over and send my globules of light
down there to see if its a deep hole if it goes
a long way what am I looking at
 We have to get this gnoll out of the bottom
of this hole because thats gold
 Its still good for the monetary value that
was laid out for us so maybe on the way out we
could send We have a rope we could lower you
down and you could slice it off
 Not right now save it for a rainy day
 Wait Nott do you want to let her take a look
at it In case it could blow up on you
 You know what we could do If we want to
check this cave for more people is that we could
bring them up to the cart and I could do that one
spell that I have that would let me know down here
if anything is happening up there
 Yeah If the little bell goes off in my head
then I know that either that somethings coming out
 The good kind ja We would know more or less
not  percent perfect but pretty close Then we
could come back down here quickly and see if
theres anyone else who needs help
 Well I was thinking about getting them to
safety outside If anything leaves the mine well
know it was them
 You know people dont bare balls all the
time but I think its a reasonable risk at this
point in time
 I will help you look because I have an
eye
 No I have very trust me I mean I could
roll for shit but
 Thats okay
 Do I have advantage
 Thats a little better Oh yeah its good
Thats  You know for level three Fnfzehn
 No actually Im going to scoop up some of
those pieces of rotted meat and put them in my
pockets
 You cant smell it
 Thats why Im taking it
 Its there by good
roll
 Yeah  for him
 I would say that I did not partake in any of
that As soon as we exited efficiently I pulled
out the silver thread and Im already doing my
thing while they do that
this isnt over
 I guess we do not need a perception check
 Oh good Thats my specialty
 Thank you Ugh
 Eight
 Ja
 You brought me from a four to a seven
 I stubbed my toe
 
 Frumpkin was obliterated
 You know its funny because only about 
minutes ago I also had a bird but he was
obliterated
 It was very sad Ill bring him back
tomorrow

 He and I we are like that
 Its not a cat
 Im also going with the Dancing Lights
Theyre not leading the way The closest one is
actually ten feet behind us like a choochoo train
back behind the group so that its dim light  to
 feet ahead of us
 Just give you a little bit of boost you
know
youre about to do
 Oh low rolls at both
 Oh verdammt It didnt work were in
trouble they are coming I think theyre coming
 Come back to us please
 I already sent the message
 I would get a spell back yeah
 We say ja
 Ja
 You havent lived until youve slept on
Dwarven Forge
 Oh god weve got to stop
 We are down that way
 Over this way
 Its bright behind us not in front of us so
much
 Oh thats a  natural roll
 He might have even thought it was a bat
 Surprised is like a condition Like poison
but they know something is
 No you ruined it It was so good
 Can I say I change my mind every five
minutes about whether this group was a good idea
or a terrible idea and Im listening to these
chuckleheads talk to each other and Im waiting
to cast Blur on myself when it looks like
everybodys going to do something but Im waiting
until the last minute
 Good for you You get a doughnut
 Hey Ill be in the back
 Ive pulled the ripcord on Blur if theyre
doing that
 There is a vision of me before me and also
behind me flickering in and out of view
 Siebzehn
 Siebzehn is seven
 That is that one yeah The cube is a six
Hey a three
 Careful
 The closest globule is ten feet behind us
 My choochoo train of globules of light go
 and float over all our heads
 Yeah Im already falling into a routine
with my other human friend here because I know
that shes a badass but not without light The
globules pass her and curve to the left a little
bit and one floats above her head The last one
 That was it No Im staying where the hell
I am
 Ah Ill move up  feet Sorry I
apologize Entschuldigung
 Gnoll Washington

 Oh nice
 Regular gnoll
  Engage
 Toll house
 I dont really have a clear view of whats
going on so I would on this wall here I would
inch five or ten feet up the cave to see whats
going on
 I see a gigantic gnoll and okay
 The big one
Im going to do what I did to him before and
Im going to bring my hand once around twice
around three times around and cast Scorching Ray
on that one only First is a 
 Second one hits as well and the third one
also hits

  That is a total of  of fire damage
 I wipe my arm down and say
 Oh boy
 Yeah thats done
 I had no idea that was there
 We can imagine that Matt We needed the
fear of god
 Yeah that back wall perfectly blocks that
whole thing
 Your eldritch knight is going to be great
 Come on ninja
  Monk monk monk
 A natural 
 This is clearly a case of the husband
favoring the wife
 Advantage and have a good bonus
 Youve already fallen off one cliff youre
not going to do it again
 Its the exact same thing
 Blind justice
 What a turn around
 Well you can do this a million times
 Maybe get a little bit closer
in order to
 Not all the way
  feet of range on that
 Yeah what are they like lie down or
drop your weapons or its a single word so
drop Drop everything in his hands or you could
say lay
 You could say dance and he would just
start dancing
action How about oh you know what Drop
 Im not by the way
 Weve got four jokes this campaign
 Caleb who was just going into his bag to
pull out a ro oh she does not need the rope
okay So instead I pull out the diamond and I
start spinning it around and it turns to thunder
and I sent that flying into the tannish colored
Chromatic Orb to that one yeah
 That hits That is a  to hit
 Yeah This is thunder damage is a total
of oh just eight you know Just eight points
of thunder damage
 Okay This looks good Im going to back
down the stairs and stand by Shakste I think
Diplomatic immunity

 All good SechsSechsy
 Spiritual Weapon
 Its got one hit point
 With a letter
 Patrick Rothfuss again
 Its yours
 Yeah
 All those dice that you could check before
the game You could roll them
 Were all real good friends
 How much was in there
 Its a step up for me
 Like the mine
 Burn the mine to the ground Under the
ground
 Our guests are like farm animals that we
mine for loot
 Its sight and hearing for Find Familiar
 Nah its pretty good
 There it is 
  feet
 I dont know maybe not on our own two at a
time Im pretty tapped but theres a lot of us
here and only a few of them there according to
our new friend
 We could also try and seal the cave behind
us as we go
 Could we do a quick inventory check of how
much of these boom sticks that we have the TNT
 We have more than one You have one
 We have one amongst Okay
 It would help
 Im pretty shitty at stealth
 Plus
 Thank you Jester for saving my ass because
the first roll was a four The second one was a

 Jester and Beau
 Yeah youve got dex
 Also DM
 I will also say and Ill do this a lot
Dancing Lights is in effect behind us  feet
behind us waiting
 Sees  Okay
 I did not see that
 Did you know that you cant see
 Oh It was really good It was a  total
 The bird
 Thats hot
 Come on birdy Ooh Good
 Its 
 Its alphabetical right on the list Ooh
 Plus
 Are we in a weird inbetween combat and
noncombat
 I would like to hug the wall and slide along
it I would like to think I can hear my
friends breathing and stop yeah thats good
and hold my action and if anything comes this way that
is not my friends to cast Burning Hands as a
tripwire Im the tripwire
 Yeah of course within range
 Yeah maybe the other side of the tunnel so
they dont see you
 You can see me doing this
 Yeah pull him to the other side Theyre
seeing me do arcane bullshit on the side while
sweating
 I attack her
 Not within range Then I dont do it yet
 Wow My initiative is such dick All night
long All campaign long lets be honest
 Oh my gosh At the end as always
 Acht
 Theres people after my eight
 What did you roll to hit
 Those arrows are long gone
 All tens come on
 Wheres your AC
 Youre Grog
 You cant even see it
 So this has happened like six times now
where I go right after Beau so Dancing Lights
excuse me
 Of course
 So instead Dancing Light Im going to do
the same line of light that I always do because
Beauregard needs to be able to kill things and
see One goes far as here and here and here probably
 Its always a line spread out
 No Im also going to back up about  feet
as well Then Im going to crouch because Im frightened
 He done been bifurcated
 Save us
think rather than Spiritual Weapon we need to go
with the Thunderwave again
 Thats a very short range though
 You cant get close enough to anybody on
that map to use it
 Do you have a level one left
 I think these are your best options
 either
a floating weapon that can go anywhere or a big
fog cloud if you run up and put it on the priest
or up there I think probably Spiritual Weapon
is is that I can move it from one to the other
 You can adjust
 Decide what it is A lollipop a salmon a
sword
 Nunchucks
 Have fun
thinking for some reason was I would like to
materialize the aweinspiring sass of Estelle
Getty and pummel the stomach
 It could be a cudgel carved to look like
Estelle Getty if you wanted it to be
Girls I think because my lovely daughter
literally It was  days into the school year
and she dressed like a yearold woman today
my sixyearold daughter I think that the bust of
a tiny curlyheaded yearold woman needs to
slam its way into the torso of that manticore
 Like a Beethoven bust but Estelle Getty
 Thats the d yeah
 Thats true
 Thank you for being a friend
 Notts going to die
 Are you up
 Fjord Nott Notts in danger
 I saw that and I walk as far forward as I
can with my movement and start stirring the pot on
Chromatic Orb I have one left I will use ice
damage and I will send it out and I knock it off
my hand towards the manticore Come on please
 Thats a 
 That is d cold damage That is ooh 
total
 I would have gone as far forward as I can
 Caleb is breathing very heavily and not
looking at the manticore Hes looking at Nott in
Beauregards arms
 Oh Necrotic Necrotic just follows Laura
Bailey
 Clerics down One of our clerics is down
 Its your call I will help you with
decisions you make You can get to the front of
those stairs
 Do you have any spells slots left
 No thats great
 Thats all you can do is try to take down
the enemies and we can help Thats all you can do
Flame the priest
 Id get it into the business
 Its on its way for the next round
 Yeah in time for your turn
 What about the dynamite
in its mouth
 Ja I cannot see too well so Im going to
take a step forward between Mollymauk and Nott
Just a little bit there Now I can see that blond
hair and I am tapped out so Im just going to
let my hand blacken and say a few arcane words and
then send a
 Well then I will if I cant see too well
keep going down the steps until I can see him
 Thats fine Thats not fine but thats
fine Fire Bolt and here it comes to you
shithead That is a  to hit
 But I could roll a one I rolled a ten

 Im going to extend my hand forward I have
five fingers out and then I pull in four I send
the flame down my hand because these people have
hurt my little friend I want his hair to burn off
his head and die
 Thats a seven
 I was going to do this on my own
 Did you use all your slots
 Thats hospitality
 
 Yeah
 You do
 I would like to sit on my ass and look at
the ground
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You just cured me
 Also Caleb has been very distant for the
last couple of hours but absentmindedly scoops up
Notts hand Doesnt look at Nott but holds
Notts hand
 Khary
 Uh oh All right I know how this works

 Slipping you the digits
 Hes got gloves on him dont touch it
 Crystallized rice
 Just for one day
 I liked that guy though He was good
 He was talented
 He was burned alive in front of me
 I am well aware that I killed a person I
have nothing else to say why is everyone looking at me
 Im okay
 It was terribly grisly his hair was on fire
and he burned horribly Maybe it went a little
further than I anticipated I have killed people
before in defense ja But not like that
 Okay that sounds good
 Would you like to know what they are before
you put them on
 Look over here You look like a nerd
 Yeah
 I dont have ability I understand
certain magics If you want me to explain what
those things are before you try them willynilly
yes I can tell you
 May I see it
 Yeah You know Im just going to check DD
Beyond to see if I Yeah Im all tapped but
 I will tell you something
 I will tell you something
 I dont need to
have this ring I can tell you what it is
 I do but I need a pearl I say to Fjord I
need a somewhat valuable pearl then I can do it
all day long I can know what anything is even
though I am tired
 Is that worth about a hundred gold pieces
 Oh yes let me Can I borrow this
 This is not instantaneous Since I am so
tired it takes me a little bit longer I wedge
out one of my books and I set it on the ground
 Its up to you I havent done this in a
while and Im excited to do it But I could hold
off a little
 Okay I take the book and I close it and
then I put it back
 No I have both the ring and the one that
Fjord gave me So if its good for you you may
have it Im more interested in executing
skill
 Before we even go into the building I go
over to Nott and adjust the hood a little bit
further forward
 The ears are in and make sure that the mask
is secure Have fun
 Yeah Im okay It was a rough night
 I did
 No I did not see a vision I saw a burning
person
 Lets go get a drink
 Im going to find a corner table in the
ruckus I will take the ring with the pearl and I
hold it right here I pull out the other ring and
I look at it and I begin to focus and study the
different angles of it and hope that I have a
pearl of enough value to make things happen
 Its already out
 You know when you play DD you dont
narrate taking a pooper but you can assume that
the characters take a pooper every day
 Some things just happen
 Yes
 Oh
 This is good You may have it I dont get
into water too much as you could guess This is
good for walking yourself upon water You take
this as promised
 Yeah but also why is there a dickbutt in my
spellbook
 I dont know Maybe it was Nott pulling a
prank on me
 No I dont need well I do want one drink
but I dont need a ton of drinks This is my
thing so what else did we get
 I will take the wand
 Thank you
 I need another ten minutes Fjord would you
get me a second whiskey By the time you get back
maybe I will understand what this is
 Ten minutes later
 
 Its fascinating

 Oh Do you know how to use wands
 Is she full of shit What do I roll
 Yeah I got a 
 No its for me I gave you the ring Thats
the deal I promised it to you and now you have it
 If I tell you you will try to steal it from
me
 No its too dangerous

 Fine do you want to know what it does
 I will show you what it does
 I point this stick at Jester
 It is a charisma saving throw
 Oh its just a stick
 No Told you
 A low what
 I promise youll have these back because I cannot
lift them Would you put them on the table for me
 Hold the ring and wait
 They are a very strange one If you are
feeling gassy they take away the cramps you feel
You have to wear them Its extraneous its too
much
 Its overkill
 These are shit I slide them off the
table
 I want to do it again What do we have Give
me the thing
 Okay
 Yeah Oh
 No this is great Its very powerful It
is a fine weapon Probably better than anything
except maybe for your blade Is anyone able to
use a glaive I cant do anything with it
 Do you know what this is It is a very good
sale at a pawn shop
 Well its very painful if it hits you
 Thats it
 Most definitely it is magical yes Stronger
than your average glaive thats what I am saying yeah
 You know people in Zadash
 Whos got the monster calves to carry this
There you go
 Here
 Oh my goodness yeah Like  minutes have
gone by looking at all these things
 He just puts it away
 He puts the wand down in front of Jester
 It just hurts people
 Do you know how to use arcane artifacts
 What
 Hes not gone Hes always with me and he
will be back tomorrow
 Yeah It burns people like I burned that
man
 Would you like to trade your goggles for
them
 You have that very fancy sword you have
 Does it mean that much to you Would you
like it
 Okay Here it is
 I dont know No Hes good
 I dont move at the speed of your thought
 Im sorry that I kept it for myself Enjoy
I will not take any of the spoils of anything we
find anywhere Enjoy
 It does hurt people You seem very angry at
me right now
 Im slowly ever so slowly beginning to like
you so please dont fuck it up
 This is what people do
 Is she still smiling
 Its constitution though isnt it
 I said constitution to you
 Okay Im sure Ill fail it 
 I will also pay for a room for Nott and
Caleb
 Wait did you just ja Did you pay for
everybody or for you
 Danke
 Im going to go get my cat I go up
 Well I first take out the silver thread and
I cross it across the door and if theres any
windows there I do the same and allow for Nott to
enter and leave Then I draw patterns along the
floor that spread up onto the table as well and
back down onto the floor I squat with my book
since I am tapped and I begin to bring back my
cat An hour and ten minutes later I dont know
if theyre asleep or not I have this cat named
Frumpkin and I wear him like a scarf
 Come here I promise
 I promise not to do that too often I just
scritch for a long time
 Im sure that ones not important
 I know
  Fuck balls
 Did you give me a pouch
 When did you do that
 Oh what is in it Lets see
 One
 Two
 And then ten minutes later
 Did you say 
 Okay so after counting it all I separate
it and I put some jerky down go have it to
Frumpkin and I push  gold across the floor
Come here
 I have a question
 the metal on the ring
with the pearl in it what is it made of Can I tell
 I cannot remember but Caleb can because of
I can do
 Yeah that is correct
 Copper silver wood
 I just cant remember if it is Do we have a
Players Handbook
 Brass is not on it okay Then Im going to
spend the last  minutes before bed trying to
slowly wedge the pearl out of the ring I dont
want the ring
 
 Brass

it across the room for Frumpkin to go chasing it across
 Go chase that
  We are assholes

them into his pockets

 Agreed that is our first stop
 We are looking for Claudia Sheed

looking for
I have been in the woods for so long Im so happy
to be in a metropolis again I need ink

 I dont see I have no idea
 Okay this is a little offputting
 First question that I have for you Pumats
 Pumat Sol is there one of you and this is
fun and games or you are
 Understood Well I only came here for
business so
 I am finding it very hard to concentrate at
the moment but I know that I need paper and the
most expensive ink you have
 You know
 I am not seducing this person
 Touch
 I need your most fine arcane ink and I also
need your finest paper I need about  gold
worth of materials Is that too much to ask
 No I pull two scrolls out of my pack I
have these I found them in my journeys and I want
to make them a part of my repertoire
 Matt I love you so much

 Meanwhile I take every gold piece I have in
a little sack plus  silver which is exactly
 and I am out of money
 Insight check
 That is a 
 I looked at the paper motherfucker
 Yeah I have to make a new character guys
Im sorry
 I think that hes just dealing with used
items
 You could work him for a little bit not a
lot
 A short case of
 A cheat code if you will
 Come on La
 Jester Shits and giggles or utility is the
question here
 You have enough gold to cover it
 Also where in the year are we in relation
to Winters Crest
 Okay Good
  Jester

 Red velvet Its good
 What time of day is it as we arrive at the
Leaky Tap
 Where did those cow men come from Matt
 Where does firbolg come from
  Just been writing campaign
lore for too long
 Swamp Khary Payton with CR love Swamp him
 Except this is DD so theyre real penises
 Ten gold a head
 Im at a bar thats the way it goes
 I saw that you were eyeballing the room
Alles gut
 Everything is good
 That is accurate
 White scales
 It is one of the languages of the country
 Good name
 A question Is there any rafters or any
high place in the room behind these gentlemen
 For the moment I scootch Frumpkin down to the
floor and send him off towards behind these
gentlemen to hang around under that spot for the
moment
 Nott I think youre too young to be
watching this You should come sit with me over
here
 No its a bad idea Youre too little for
gambling
 Use your skill
 Come let us go sit over here
 I walked away from this one
 Frumpkin climbs up into the rafters with a
view of the gentlemans cards
 I would like to start looking at their cards
through Frumpkins eyes
  Get ready to use your wire
 Yeah Thats a 
 Okay Tell our friend that Mr Mustache is
sitting pretty and the young boy has Scheie
 Reverse that order please Also I would
like the curly fries
 Yeah but that one had potential
 Why dont instead we have something to drink
and eat
 Only I get to say Schiet you have to say
Sheed
 What time of the evening do I know it to
be
 Ja okay
 Yeah thats late Its not that late
 I thought you were going somewhere else for
a second
 Charter school
 Lotteries are a bitch
 Sorry
 I want to touch on something happening
Im not there Were not there
 So I want to touch on something thats
happening at the same time but I will wait until
you think its a good moment
 Yeah Nott and Caleb didnt go up Theyre
busy Would you like to learn something interesting
 Sort of
 Its a little homework and a little bit
magic trick This is where I keep my spells This
is my book And this is the piece of luck that you
helped me achieve in Trostenwald Over the months
and years I gather the amount of magic tricks that
I can do So in this book for instance there is
a new spell that I do not even know how to use
myself where I can make an invisible helper What
is going to happen now I bought supplies for it
I find a booth for us in the corner is I am
going to move it from here into here and I thought
you could help me Would you like to do that
 Okay So you can see
 I dont know what that means but this will
take a little while Here hold this I hand a
quill to her Hold that You can see the markings
on this page Its intricate but you can do the
first few strokes It needs to look like that it
needs to go here I guide her hand a little bit to
make sure that it doesnt smudge too much Its
still workable Good Now I will fill in the
details I spend the next they are probably gone
for  minutes putting down the glyphs and
the markings
 And begin the first  minutes of the two
hours I need to spend copying this
 Oh yeah Sliding them over
 Its like latticework you have to do the
smaller circle inside the larger
 Each ones a little bit different
 Were really right in the middle of
something
 Frumpkin climbs up Mollys back
 What are you doing with my cat
 Go to the base look the circle goes
inside the larger circle
 You know maybe we pick this up later
 How much do you need For what
 Ill give you two
 I hand them over
 Hold on
 Theres a bunch of people staring at Fjord
and Beauregard Why are we doing this
 I think its like Alcoholics Anonymous
or something
 Does that name mean anything to Caleb
 When you scroll your cursor over it though
the descriptions are all in red
 I tell Frumpkin to yowl between their legs
 I dont see it Im not looking through it
 Yeah
 I bamfed out of that probably two minutes
before it finished so I didnt get the tail end
but I got the meat
 Hes not sticky with maple syrup Hes
lying
 Maybe not that but quite frankly those
people are reckless telling you what they told you
 The authorities dont delineate between the
real McCoy and the passersby Just like that mans
story The dwarf
 Im going to turn in I have a little bit
more homework to do before the end of the night
Good night Thank you Good night
 I am just finishing up the spell Unseen
Servant before I go to bed so that I will know it
in the morning
 Yes Yes
 How do you get money from your mom
 Oh you didnt come downstairs Okay
 Is Claudia down in this room at the moment
 Very well I am a step ahead of where I was
yesterday
  I walk over to this
dragonborn Good morning to you
 Sorry I know you are busy preparing for the
day
 I hear there is a rather large library here
in this city This is correct ja
 Thats the biggest one The main one
 The Hall of Erudition
 Oh good Okay The first place though
could you point me in the direction of it from here
 Library is there
 And its to the east you were saying
 Ja okay I shrink inward

the plumpest plum on the bush
 Okay
 This was an idea you had
 Right Im not going to question it
 Okay thank you okay
 She is the grumpy one Pencil in the DMs
neck
 Its like Medieval Times
 Also Im sorry some of you wish to be in
the spotlight with the things that we do
 Also Fjord walks right up behind Jester and
with the others Okay This is not a good idea to
put yourself out in the open lets go
  Yes its me Im Fjord Come

 There was a cough drop stuck in the side of
my mouth
 This is deep Texan I dont know
 Listen accents are not my strong suit
Would you please just stop talking to the town
crier Thank you Im trying to drag her back
 Yeah back towards the group
 Probably
 It sounds about as good as I just did
Calebs not good at accents
 I am Fjord Tough lets go
 But I dont smell bad Now come on lets go
to the rest of the group
 I pull her by the earlobe Can we please go
back to the rest
 Im sorry Is this what we are going to be
about Huge credit and get ourselves to be part
of the news
 I am not giving you shit I am putting a
subject on the table for the group I need to make
an informed decision about what Nott and I are
doing
 I dont want to be about making a stink
everywhere we go
 Its not just me You are vomiting salt
water and you are getting into fistfights with
people I dont know what youre doing And you
Look at you
 Go along with the group
 Yeah
 I have fought a giant toad creature with
you I have fought a big lion thing with a womans face
 As everybody walks to Beau I say
 Listen
its just about logistics I mean you are very
 No I dropped it You are in peak physical
condition your guns are amazing I cant do
what you do I cant run into it of course Im
 yards back because Im thin as a wet toilet paper
 Ive got to stop complimenting you it does
not lead to good moments I walk away
 We might be able to take it to a school or a
medical facility to sell Studies
 Were in the pentagram penta
 So were close to the library I thought it
was in that area
 Okay so were closer now then we were I
dont see the entrance from where we are or do we
 The whole kit and caboodle is visible from
here
 Okay Does anyone mind if we swing by and
just take a look at the Archive Not go in you
know we have other things were going to do but
just to take a look
 You have seen it before
 Okay how long did you do that
 Okay Well I am a tourist
 Okay
 Would you like to show me the Archive Not the
inside the outside
 Never mind I dont want to put you out
Anyone want to go see the Archive
 Yeah
 Its just a volume thing sometimes Okay
lets go look
 Oh jeez
 The Archive
 So you do know what toilet paper is
 Okay
 I would just like to look around Its in a
square you say
 Yeah Well I am no super spy but I would
like to just look at the area and see what I see
in the nature of security other than these
obvious robed figures
 And you said everyone going in and out was
being escorted by one of these individuals
 If I see one or two people going in or out
what do they look like
 Same fancy type
 Fancier than me
 Yeah Okay Thats a beautiful building
Theyre all wearing the same thing
 Youve lived here for a few months What do
you know about this place
 Obviously I am very interested in learning
Is it easy to gain admittance Do you know that
sort of thing
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah thats what it means
 Yeah
 Well youve really sold me on it lets go
find the others
 Do I have any chance in hell knowing where
she went Because I start looking around immediately
 Okay no Thats a one
 
 Youre not helping me Like at all
 We are going to look around now is what
were doing
 Thats how the empire works

DM
 Herald of the Hall
 Voloshin

the Empire Im all for
 Just now or do you mean just a moment ago
 Hes a little tiny mosey
 Finally a bath
 Ill pass on it
 The clothes are still pretty shit though
 My hair is killer right now The clothes are
old and shitty
 Some stink dont come off
 I meant blood but sure
 The poop is right there
 Have you been hot on our heels this whole
time to keep pace with us
 How many people have you heard that from
 In a handful of days
 Yes I have been in this bath for a few
minutes No you were here when I got here Thats
true We visited an arcane shop and the
gentlemen Im not sure really The
proprietors of the shop did a little dippity doo
to me and it just took everything away
 Yeah he gave me the carwash Took it all
away
 Yeah I dont like this I start sinking
into the bath enveloping everything and sitting
on the bottom and holding my breath for a little
while
 Oh its hot down there on the ears
 I could hold you and you could do the dog
paddle Have you ever seen the dog paddle before
 Well you know
 Does the little Fjord look wet or dry
 I love magic so much
 Hey theyre all about to start having sex
You might want to get out of here
 With this one
 Do you have any sort of religion or
tradition of heavy metal or something
 As a victim of Campaign One
 yes there has
to be
 Thats not milk
 Hes done you are with friends
 Yasha theres a heavier presence of the
Empire here than there was in Trostenwald How
does that sit with you
 Insight check
 Okay Do I believe her I do Okay
 What about a big reader
 Natural 
 Yeah you just joined back up with us She
doesnt need to tell us her life story
 You are literally undercutting the very
thing I just said
 Five or six days in I think and Im really
questioning this decision
 Totally blind
 Is this one still in disguise Nott are you
still in disguise
 Its an hour that it takes
 Are our clothes in here or somewhere else
 But I didnt send mine off to be cleaned
 Im going to pull the spool of silver thread
and Ill take a length of it out and Im going to
pull Notts hair back and do a little ponytail
Simple
 I think the moments passed for the rest of
us I think we should go
 Have fun storming the castle
 And the water drops a foot and a half

 Where are you going
 Would you mind I dont want to go in but
would you mind if I tagged along with you
 Nott did you want to stick with the others
Im going to run an errand with Jester
 Not for this I should just be gone a couple
of hours
 I think chances are very low
 Yeah I have the one you secured for me
yeah
 Go have fun Maybe you get another button or
two from a grumpy person
 Caleb sees this and just goes
 I feel like I know you better now
 Regis
 Shyster
 Does that happen licketysplit the second
guard comes down
 Right and as she goes and does her thing I
just want you to know that Frumpkin does follow
her and I leave and walk around the block and
duck into an alley or any private place and cast
Disguise Self on myself to make myself look very
resplendent
 For Frumpkin Its not very good That is
only a four
 Does that take any damage
 Gone
 I rolled hit points for him when I made him
and it was one so hes gone
 Whos laughing now Billy Whos laughing
now
 Caleb curses to himself and wanders around
and does what he says suddenly looking very
noble Ill let that go and then Ill follow up
 Caleb is pissed
 I am wearing the deepest black robes and I
have a black goatee Very Evil David Hasselhoff
 Sure that
 Its all black velvet The way the audience
thinks Vax looks thats what I look like right now
 I have a meeting in  minutes at the Pillow
Inn I dont know what its called but Caleb
does I dont remember shit but Caleb says
whatever the name of it is because of my feat
 Of course it is it was chosen very
specifically I say whatever its called
 I dont remember he does I have a meeting
in  minutes at the Pillow Grove I know thats
wrong Right now  minutes I need to get in
 The spell didnt work here
 Oh wow
 Yeah he used Disguise Self
 We dont know
 Okay I just walk away
 Cat kicker
 Yeah its fancy pants
 Quickly could I have asked around and found
my way to the other entrance to this area by now
 No I have this Super quick
 a single
question at the gate
 Ask around find my way there All right so
I walk up straight looking like me
 Excuse me may I have a word of your time
may I have a moment of your time
 Listen to me there is a store in here
called Chastitys Nook that sells dirty books I
have heard of it for months and I am going to
shop at this store and if you want to make three
gold and if this one wants to make three gold
you will let me in there to shop for smut at the store
 I want to be
 One two three One two three each of
you
 Okay enjoy working for the man I walk
off
 Done
 How was it
 Thats okay I have a little bit of money
do you need some
 I have about  gold do you want me to give
you some
 Thats a lot of money
 It is
 Thats more money than my parents ever made
in their entire life
 In full view of Jester I reach into my
pocket and take whats left of the mud and just
Then I storm off towards our original shitty inn
 I dont hear that
 I like you Do you want to hang with us for
a while
 Oh this day is great
 Its beast killing time
 Thats good advice
 Send all of your complaints for not knowing
what would happen in the porno shop to matthewmercer
 The place is crawling with
 Got to get to that shop man
 Got reasons
 It still is
 I mean it is not totally unheard of The
legends in history are full of stories of the gods
dabbling with mortals I dont know what happened
for you today but it is not common but it does happen
 Hello guy
 It would take quite a while longer I think
its too early for you to have checked today
 Also sometimes people steal your mail You
can get robbed on the road
 Shit happens
 I was not able to accompany her to the
Pillow Trove
 Because I am shabby
 Shabbily dressed
 You know I was thinking on the walk back
here that I would probably like to get a cloak of
some kind
 I know where everything is in every pocket
of this coat It has been with me through a lot What
 I will probably just get a cloak
 Im not bothered It seems like maybe
 You know water is not very hard to come by
so I can
 Thats what Im saying is the sewer first
because you are all going to be dirty like me
 Also I dont think thats the main issue
Theyre very strict at the gate for who gets in
and some of us might not have a problem but more
than one of us might
 It seems more like you are hung up on it
than I am
 Thats why I want to pay for a cloak
 Are we going to

 Two things one Fjord will you pass me
these cookies over here
 Thank you Second of all are we going to
try to tackle this sewer this evening or is this
something that were going to do tomorrow
 Yeah
 Oh Im not opposed to going down there I
just mean are we waiting until cover of night or
are we doing this
 No
 No
 Youve been bad
 Yeah thats also dim light though as well
Its not super bright Unless I
 This game is amazing
 I would like to keep my eye out for a decent
clothing shop
 That is 
 I would like to get something that is brown
muted nothing gaudy Probably dont have that anyway
 Ill take the brown one Yeah
 Its  gold
 Okay I have that
 Of course I can do that I ask for the
largest size they have and I get a woolen cap as well
 Yeah okay I have that
 Ruin
 Are there any clowns in it
 That is a why Im looking it up a ten
 Any sounds going on in there
 You have to think about it for a while
 The boulder from Raiders
 Do you want Nott down there Its what you
do Youre very good
 Thats a Nintendo controller
 Go further away from people
 Everythings going to be fine Jester
 Were we told that there was some sort of
webbing
 I see Any of that as we go
 
 Know how much diarrhea blasting they did in
the Middle Ages

 Thats all thats in the haversack
 Blockages
 Hey Im at the back
 Vier
 From breaking open
 Is the torch in your punching hand
 Eight
 I would like to start backing up towards in
this direction towards Nott away
 Oh no I would use a Caleb bonus action to
dry heave and then I will use my action to cast
Fire Bolt towards the rat by Yasha
 Ja  That it is a oh no thats
okay Its a 
 Ja d Its five hit points of damage
 Everyones catching their disease here
 Before we move I am standing with two
flickering Calebs next to me and all three of us
look at Molly like Jim from The Office and they go
away

 What were you down to
 Yeah thats my max
 Yeah Im sitting at 
 Yeah thats your job
 Ah you know Ive been worse Its okay
Im okay
 If who hits me very hard
 If she hits me very hard I am a dead man
If she hits me very hard Im probably okay
 I know thats just you know its just
a
 You have a monster on your chest
 Generally are you asking me
 Right now No because I am with all of you
and those were just mice
 The rats are not making webbing Theres
something else
 Its probably a giant spider
 Well I would theorize that perhaps their
diet is  food and  diarrhea so its not
very surprising that they explode into fecal
matter
 You could just say nine
 No they had pinkeye in all their parts
 Youre coming back after a break
 
 I have read a lot of books Lots of them
Have I ever read anything about the science of
larger insectoid creatures
 Okay but its not familiar to me
 Like YouTubers
 If we kill the beasts that are down here
then it might be worthwhile to also check the
bodies of the guards you know because theyre
not going back to the to their families you
following me
 Well theyre not going to use it
 Just a suggestion we dont have to do this
Im not even sure how I feel about it but I have
just learned how to create a somewhat spectral
servant to me one that is unseen I could send it
in to poke about and if anything is going to
happen it could happen to it first instead of us
 Yeah it could poke at things and you know
 Yeah
 If you burn its web it will do the same
thing
 I think thats actually a very good idea
 Okay Also I will say that you were
worried about burning their dead bodies But if we
burn the dead bodies they might burn were not
going to help them but if any coin have or any
items that are magical in nature will be fine So
its okay
 Yeah thats possible This thing that I can
do this servant that I can make Its not going
to be able to open these things Its very weak
 Thats true
 I pull a stick out of my coat and I hold it
between thumb and pinky like this and theres a
string wrapped around it and I take my fingers
and I pull along the string which begins to glow
a faint gold glow and a being same height and
about same skinnyass proportions as myself
appears before me
 It doesnt appear You tell me because
youre the dungeon master
 Well the rats have already started So
Schmidt I want you to go to these larger bundles
and give them a little pokeypoo
 I have to stay within  feet of Schmidt
  Schmidt bring me the bracer
 What
 What did you say I did not understand your
accent
 Shh
 Yeah we all wonder that
 Well not moving
 I can do it from a distance yeah
 I would like to stand behind everybody
 I can do this from  feet away once every
six seconds Im going to use Fire Bolt I would go
 and hit them both
 Just as a test to the one on the right I do
it again
 Okay well hes dead Should I just keep
chipping away
 Well this is every six seconds so I could
just stand here for a minute going whoosh whoosh
whoosh and not get close
 So I guess Ill take the next  or 
seconds if thats what it takes Ill focus on
one and just keep burning it away
  We are the worst We are the
worst
 Caleb stands still for a second and looks
around Do I hear anything
 Oh in my sleeve Oh thats a one So I
dont hear anything
 Jester put it on the ground and take ten
steps back away from it
 
 If we deem it safe maybe someone could look
out this other exit because probably something
is down here with us but mayhaps above the grate
this thing lives in a house perhaps I dont know
Im spitballing
 That is also good That is two reasons to do
it
 Is Jester right up with the halfling
 I am going to walk up to Jester and stand
next to her and then I am going to send Schmidt
forward to this halfling to try to maybe lift up
his its I cant tell you The chin of this halfling
 Well if I cant see
 Oh well okay
 Well I would say if I cant see if I knew I
cant see if I were really in this place instead
of sitting as this table
 If I couldnt see coming up I would go
 and send out Dancing Lights
 There you go
 While this death is happening Caleb is
Schmidt go like this to the halfling Calebs
going Hey guy hey hey hey
  Fnfzehn
 Can I get either inside or behind that crate
thats in the corner with difficult terrain
 Okay for an action I am going to cast the
Blur spell on myself again und I will use my
bonus action to have Schmidt come Im assuming
hes not affected by webs
 Well then I will summon him to stand above
me on the box
 There you go Freemasons Hes actually a
half orc
 I mean Beau is pretty fucking amazing in
combat
 Its like an airplane
 Healing Word maybe
 Okay I can see a straight line from the
spider to me so I think
 Yeah okay all right Im going to use my
movement to crawl out of the box so I can get a
better bead on it hopefully Ill go as far
forward and to the side as I can to get a better angle
 Okay so I am going to steady my arm against
the other arm and point at it and blacken my hand
and send a Fire Bolt at it Here it goes well
see if it hits probably not No I dont think it
does That is a 
 Then before the end of my turn Im going to
 and Schmidt silently comes up as close
as he can get next to me
 Ja
 Aw man thats that Fjord edge right there
 Schmidt its Schmidt
 Yasha is a heavy metal album Thats pretty
dope
 Yeah Spiders an asshole
 Were all still figuring it out
 Because sightlines are a problem here I
would like to move to dead center where Jester
just was actually so I have a clear sight on the
chamber behind me and ahead of me
 Yeah I can see everywhere more or less in
here
 I pull the diamond out from my coat and get
ready and I hold As soon as I see the spider
Im going to release Chromatic Orb
 Its about  feet
 I prepped acid on this thing and I missed
bad I got a total of nine so that did not hit
 Yeah No just nine
 Worth the risk Thats exciting
 Raid
 Put him in a mocking bag Molly
 Actually since I see that Jester has this
covered Im going to start burning out the dead
people and rooting through their pockets and
stuff
 Thats good
 Oh man Full of lessons for America today
 Im only burning the dead ones fire
billowing
 Thed is dead baby
 Its a Nickelback tattoo

 Caleb is blithely burning over here and has
no idea whats going on behind him
 Of course I am Im waiting for the DM to
fill in the blanks
 Thats five bodies I dont know if I got
them all but are there any coin purses as well
 Yeah I will quietly gather that up and put
it into my bag
 Am I able to carry that I dont even know
 Okay
  what was it
 Yeah  gold
 I am not telling you that I found that at
all
 You know Im looking but you dont know
what I found
 Sorry because everyone is so lovely can
you tell me
 
 Okay
 I dont give a fuck what Vex did
 Vex is retired in Whitestone right now
Shes not here
 Im clearly Lawful Good Clearly
 Yes
 Yes
 There was a bunch of weapons and armor
 We should reconnoiter to look at what we
have
 Throwback
 Jester will you come look at my eyes They
feel a little bloodshot Im not feeling well
after my encounter with the rats
 Wait come over here
 Come over here I walk away from the group
 I dont know if she follows me or not
 There was gold in there I would like you to
have it Its more than I had before Here is 
gold were on those people so you take it because
I know that you need money
 I know that you need money and Im very
you know look at this And I do a little joke
 Thats sad and funny at the same time You
carry the gold because I cant carry it all
 Thats fine
 Well thats why you wanted money I assume
from your mother was to help us out in the
position were in
 Yeah so you take this youre a better you
know Im always thinking about things and Im
not very good with amounts and money So you carry
it
 You know I just had a really bad day today
thats all it was I guess Im sorry as well
 No that was Im fine Im going to stare
at the wall because I dont know how to deal with
attention very well
 I am definitely not looking you in the eye
 Nothing from me
 What time of the day is it
 But what time of the day is it because I
know
 Very very close to what time it is I know

Clippy I have a magic Clippy
 Time of day I know Thats part of the
feat I know the hour of the day
 I am so cheating by following the rules in
the book
 On the stroll
 Fjord
 I want to talk to you about how that went
back there Can we walk alone for a minute
 Lets drag back Two things One is I
didnt bring it up even though maybe Beauregard
knows but I found something in there that I think
is up your alley I found some armor beyond just
crownsguard armor down there I mean listen my
friend You spit out salt water Youve got a
sword thats covered in fucking anemones and
shit
 This armor is like the Little Mermaid armor
Its all for you I found it but I would like to
trade it for you Yeah you have that glove and I
know I handed it over willingly just yesterday
but I have a checkered past and an interesting
history with flame Fire Theres no real reason
Youd be very good with that glove but I feel
like I would like to have that glove and I would
love for you to have this armor I took a look at
it while you guys were inside and it would allow
you to move freely in the ocean or in rivers or
lakes underwater and keep you safe in water
 I dont trust you yet I dont trust any of
these people yet except for No I dont trust
any of these people yet
 Ja Ive made mistakes in my life Ive
harmed people Not in a long time You know I
thought I was going to be something someday a
long time ago and now I dont Oh god Ask me
again in a couple of days I will prepare an
answer that is better than this for you I promise
 Thank you
 Thank you No youve go to go higher
 Oh hi You want to be part of the bro
moment Or a Beau moment
 I thought you were I thought youd walked
up
 We went to the bathhouse to get clean
 By the way part of the reason I didnt wash
up at The Leaky Tap is because in medieval times
they didnt have baths I thought this isnt the
Sheraton they dont have a bath
 I was under the assumption that you had to
be de Rolo level to have a bath in your house
 More of a voyeuristic position that were
talking about here
 You kept your eyes wide shut is what youre
saying
 If the moneys right and if its not
stupid is a good philosophy for this group
 We can have my cat tomorrow to link the two
groups
 Oh boy he got kicked to shit today
 Well you know its hazy because hes never
really kicked to death hes just kicked off of
the material plane
 Im not going to lie it does hurt when hes
gone but I always know he can come back if I have
the coin
 Its a little funny Frumpkin has a good
sense of humor about it
 Exactly Who kicks a fucking cat exactly is
my point You can do a lot of things and have a
very bad day but who kicks a cat
 Oh he had such a face I will never forget
this face

 Maybe
 I mean you might as well be at home picking
the wings off flies you kick a cat what is wrong
with you
 And in New Jersey
 On second thought who am I to judge Its
fine You know Frumpkin will be back tomorrow
morning because I am going to stay up late and do
what I have to do but arent we going to have a
rager tonight at this place in the fancy part of
town
 But really nice you said
 You paid for it You know you dont want it
to go to waste Theres probably a very nice
sitting room or tavern or something underneath
this place Its a shame to let it go to waste
  Bar wars nothing but bar wars
 That guy is socially awkward
 This is Fight Club really
 Show me your tats
 How big is this place
 Lets play for another six hours
 I dont want to stop
 Charlie the dog
 Thats not a surprise Sam has deep a
cappella roots You all know that
 Whats the address though
 Invulnerable Vagrant
 Keep going
 I got up early to use a ritual to bring
Frumpkin back I have enough supplies to bring
Frumpkin back one time
 Im not here Oh lets find out
 Thats a three
 I will go with you and Frumpkin will go
with you
 Honestly its very cute
 Were getting into Mr Potato Head
territory I think maybe a simple halfling woman
 They are pulling your leg
 Its hard to get a bead on her because she
always takes up and leaves
 Yes Jester also you have a very nice
personality but it is a big one
 Well just what you were just talking
about
 Thats because I was speaking to you
Jester sitting in front of me You made the windows
 I am sitting right next to you
 Its a small room
 Well switch it around then Maybe Nott
you go with Jester You stay up top and I will go
to this meeting Frumpkin will stay with you
 No because I wouldnt be able to hear what
they are saying or know what they look like This
one said she wants to punch me in the head I
dont want that to happen
 I have done that
 Are we talking about drugs again
 I will tag along with you again because I
still have
 Well its functional
 No you go to Pumats I think I dont
know I just havent split up with you a lot lately
 You and me
 No I am going with Jester to this fancy
place
 You are the muscle Shes the muscle You
guys are the muscle I am not the muscle
 I could take you back to where I bought this
cloak yesterday if you want to go there
 Prime
 Is it reusable
 Yeah You know I had that bad time
yesterday but probably different guards there and
I have this cloak now so Im going to
 Yeah
 Oh the rain has already taken care of most
of that
 Thank you Is it good
 Okay Well see if the guards think so eh
 Thats the idea yeah
 Im looking at the ground
 Its nice in here
 It has a name It is called Chastitys
Nook
 Yes its right in the name
 What was that called again
 Its a good name
 Just before we head that way just out of
curiosity what is the name of the bakery that is near
 I go and ask I walk into the come are
you hungry
 Okay I will get us some sweets if you want
 Yeah sure why not We are flush at the
moment I walk in
 Better than after

 Yeah what are you in the mood for Do you

 Bear claws Well lets see Excuse me
Whoevers running this show

Chastitys Nook
 That is a very handsome sweater you have Is
that from here in the city
 Im sorry what is your name
 Iva Pleasure to meet you
 Iva Deshin Im new to town and Im looking
for a bit of reading and this place has been
highly recommended to me and Im wondering
what
 I made you plan for this
 You know my tastes are very varied Im
always looking for something new
 Of course I am very interested in
literature recommendations
 As she walks away from us
 You know Im
obviously here for a purpose but I like
historical fiction as well and I like when the
two things are combined Do you know what I mean
 I like historical fiction I dont like
shallow smut I like to learn something while Im
being titillated I suppose
 I have rolled a zwanzig that is twenty
 Im very much interested in this and other
books as well but we will start with 
the Courting of the Crick
 Im still interested I would like to see
the quality of the book You know see if its in
mint condition
 Did she walk away from me by the way
 I cast Detect Magic
 Everything
 The range I believe is  feet if Im not
mistaken Yeah it is Am I covering every part of
the store where I am I start to browse
 Just one of the patrons Nothing behind any
doors nothing on the shelves Okay I wait for
her to return
 That is finely made May I hold it
 I turn with her so that my back is and I
speed read four pages
 Oh jeez
 Out of curiosity if I flip through do I
see any boning anywhere inside
 Yes its a high quality item you can
understand my excitement Ive been thinking in
the space of time that you have left and while I
would like to purchase something here today Im
very low on funds and the nature of this book
and the trouble I could get into I mean your
secret is safe with me but it is too hot for my
hands I was wondering if you had a copy of
Shallow Breaths here
 Perfect How much would this run me
 Three silver okay I take out the three
silver One two three and I hand it over
 Yes and did you two want to get anything
 What is your niche
 All her hopes and dreams
 Written by Seven Corbo
 Its probably about time to go pick up the
bear claws
 On the top shelf behind you there What do
you call those These pastries I slide the smut
under a tray of bread
 A tray of bread on the counter
 Yeah Hide it
 They look the other way
 Thats all right 
 Oh Okay Ill take my bread please
 Thank you Would you like to carry the bear
claws
 As were walking out I will show you a
trick that Ive learned in the past few years
Its very cold out I pull sides of the bread out
Its hot I hand to you a bread and I hand you a
piece of bread and then I shove my hands in Its
warm and I can eat it later Lets go
 Yeah but I can eat this Why are you
looking at me that way
 Its not weird Many people have done this
in this makebelieve world and also in America
 I walk out the door
 I slide my hand under the sheets and I feel
that thread count
 Maybe if you had carried a ruler you could
hit my knuckles harder next time
 No
 No
 I light my hand on fire
 I wouldve burned the bread and then I
couldnt eat it Its simple
 Well I dont have the control is a little
tricky sometimes
 Sometimes
 Zauber Like sour
 What are you looking at Youre squinting
 Where are there people
 I mean if you are in the empire youve
heard of the Cerberus Assembly ja
 Ja
 It is what it is
 Well that is also true but it also is what
it is Its the empire
 Where are you What are you doing down
there
 And
 Yeah What are you going to do about it
 Insight check
One

 Thanks Pike
 Were going to hit the bars tonight
 Nationwide yeah
 Should we go or
 Did you You bought that book
 You bought me that book That is so
expensive for this book This is just smut
 I dont know I dont read things like
this
 Yeah you have it
 You know the thing is places like that are
like yard sales  of the time there is nothing
but broken crap But once and I pat the book in
one of my holsters I found something
 Did you draw the dick on the Friends spell
You did it Thats the one
 Yeah I found that in a porn shop
 Porn
 Yeah Hidden
 You go first Give me your review
 Yeah Have at it
 I appreciate the gesture because it is the
thought that counts Its the gesture Jester
 But seriously thank you
 A Tale of Two Titties
 Theres a casino You want to go to the
casino I dont want to go there
 This neighborhood makes me a little edgy to
be honest Im done But I will go with you if you
want to go somewhere
 Shall we go
 You know Im a little tuckered Im going
to take a rest upstairs Im going to copy that
last spell into my book Ill see you guys in a
little bit maybe around dinner time
 Yeah its cocked
 Oh no
 How far in are you
 How long have you been working on it
 The second T is silent
 Oh Im with my friends here theyve shared
a bit of what is gone on here and Im sympathetic
 Thank you
 Caleb
 Yeah you have already mentioned that some
of your people were followed and eyed
 Which ones specifically
 I dabble a bit in the arcane nothing too
impressive but a little more than nothing
 Ill go along with Fjord
 What is the benefit for us
 I send Frumpkin after her
 I have a hand on Beaus shoulder
 Are any of those books of an arcane nature
because Im also looking
 Im looking through Frumpkin Very bad
 Just an eight
 Im sorry I did not catch all of the
meeting that you went to the other night Are they
paying anything Are we doing this for altruistic
reasons
 So has anything been discussed in advance
is all Im asking
 What did you say
 I did not have aoh yeah There is some
sort of wards on the gates there Its something
Ive done  times in small towns I tried to
disguise myself and there was nothing there they
saw right through it and 
they were dicks about it
 It is not the entire TriSpire because
 No not Not Nott it is not I cased the
smut shop I looked for arcane things there and
did not well But I was able to use my abilities
 Oh wait I knock on Jester and Beauregards
door
 You are turning in
 No by all means but I have changed my
mind I feel guilty for discarding the book that
you purchased for me and I was wondering if I
could read it tonight but only if you are going
to bed
 Okay Im going to read it before bed It
will take me about an hour Good night
 Come on Im just putting up the thread
come to bed Come to bed
 No No I dont
  Alarm
 I go to Jester and Beauregards room and
say
 Good morning sleepy heads I leave the book
leaning against the door
 Did I find anything good in it
 There was a lot more historical fiction in
it than actual pornographic content I was
surprised
 Feels like its weighing on you Its
amazing what a good book can do it gets its grips
into you
 Yeah because if we come out looking like
rats then out we will go
 Yeah I was going to ask if the two empire
kids know about that position
 Yes thats true
 She could be a lazy ass
 Sure
 Caleb said
 Lets find out
 Were going to be quiet in the sewers
because theres things down here
 They were everywhere the last time
 He is going to be about  inches shorter
 
 I make myself look like the male version of
the elven woman that Jester did in a similar high
collared clothing
 Nott what Fjord is implying is you know
how I can make myself look like anything
 Okay
 Well youre always good to have hidden away
in case something goes squirrely So definitely
you Maybe me as well
 Yeah
 If you make it in No Im going to stay
with Nott I will be backup Youre a good
talker We dont need two good talkers
 Yeah Oh cat
 I think that were hidden away in case
things go bad with the crownsguard After that
then theyre on their own I think
 Be careful twinnie
 Caleb is turning the diamond over and over
in his hand like a fidget spinner watching all of this
 So weve got it buttoned down
 We are not going bring this womans life
down in a shambles because she is an asshole I
mean we are assholes Ja For different
reasons
 Okay And
 Okay so let me go over this then We have
no form of payment of any kind planned in advance
We dont know if this woman has done anything
besides being a snide puppyhater
 I have personally bribed people I dont
know that I would listen I do not like the
governmentI say this quietlyI do not like the
empire but were really sticking our neck out
with very dangerous people I dont think we have
much to go on I dont think we know how were
going to be receiving recompense for this
 Well I am willing to discuss our continued
involvement once the payment is figured out
 Its on all our minds Unspoken
 We have already dropped our disguises if
they recognized us
 Yeah
 I could yeah
 Well it has to happen eventually
 Were pretty ragtag but theyre both very
good at what they do
 Insight check on that statement
 Balls Total balls
 Literally no Figuratively Yes The
biggest and the baddest potentially
 Too real
 We would like to discuss
 I want to walk away very fast if this goes
wrong My hackles are up It does not feel as sure
a bet as other things that we have done together
But okay
 But theres money involved so theres
incentive
 One hundred percent
 He is hard to read
 Level three motherfucker
 Which is possible
 Yeah Most likely
 Meanwhile at the Soltryce Academy
 So its another dance through the sewer if
we want to do that tonight which we could do
 Yeah I think that ship has sailed Fjord
 Come up with one
 Actually come up with one
 They might have some sort of edict written
by Prucine
 We will decide who goes in I also want to
discuss what exactly we are going to forge before
we go in because the plan that they laid out for
us was not good
 Scheisse is a word for it but they talked
about making it look like Sutan had broken into
Prucines home and rolled it I dont know what
effect that would have on her so I think maybe we
hatch some sort of conspiracy between the two of
them to assassinate Orentha so we will go to
Sutans house and we will leave
 Follow me please for a moment We have to
do our homework first but after we do homework
we go to Sutans we find this seal we hold onto
it We leave fake communication that you will
write that is from the HighRichter calling for a
hit
 You have stolen mail
 You can do it again
 Did not care about your buttons
 The goal to be that we leave something in
Sutans house that would make it seem that the
HighRichter has ordered a hit on Orentha and we
communications with the Myriad So we tie Sutan to
the Myriad we tie Sutan to Richter and then at
Richters house we leave forged documents we
have a letter from Sutan with the seal and also
we leave communication with the Knights
whatsit
 Also they will put out of businesses if
possible they have some sort of paperwork that
would come from the desk of the HighRichter
 Thats another thing and we can table
this but there is also the possibility that this
is all just a honey trap and that were being
drawn in for as big a fish than the Knights are themselves
 Well I think that they think they are
looking for potentially big fish Im not saying
that we are big fish But we might be walking into
a trap so eyes on a swivel is all Im saying
 Potentially or any of them Ulog seems the
shiftiest but that doesnt mean that he would
necessarily be
 You two have been speaking to them the
longest
 You are a good talker Fjord
 No thats not it
 A peacock is a fancy pet
 What happens if a pigeon goes by

 
  Youre just a little feller you
oughtnt talk like that
 Yeah but actually do you think you could go
back and say that you forgot to ask a question
 I understand that these two are really
busting your balls and I commiserate with that
but we do need in fact to ask
 Okay well we checked that box off so now
we have to get to work
 Knotts Berry Farm
 I will go to Sutans
 No the elder Im sorry
 Not without you Youll come with me
 Well how do you want to do it
 Okay
  You need some some ball bearings
man
 You die
  Haversack 
 CrossFit Tshirt
 I dont think we want the group to be too
big Let these two handle this Ren and you and I
will wait at the Leaky Tap and lay low
 We dont want to create why do we want a
group
 No were going to break into houses
together Of course Im willing to do this I just
feel like for this what are you planning to do
 Yeah okay
 No its fine
 No I my head is not in the game Well go
along
 Yeah well we could send Frumpkin to have a
look around
 I send Frumpkin He will run around the
entire building if hes able Hes also able to
climb things so I will get him up on top of
window sills if he can to take a look inside
 Is there the ability for Frumpkin to move
around to the exact opposite side of this building
 Yeah he will jump up to any windowsill on
the back of the house as well
 Yeah did you say this was a one story
building
 Five to ten minutes of hopping from ground
to window a bunch of times all I find are patient
rooms No sort of office or anything else
 One last thing how high is the roof
 Fjord come here Scooch down for a second
and I jump up onto Ive taken my vision back I
jump up onto his back Now stand up
 Okay I snap at Frumpkin and he vanishes
and I reach out and Frumpkin appears I am now
within ten feet I would assume of the top of the
building so Frumpkin is on the roof
 I want to send him to look
Then I hop down off of Ford and put my hand and
steady myself on Fjord and have Frumpkin look for
any holes in the roof or if theres a skylight
or anything Probably not but its worth a try
 Okay I call him back
 Then I  And then hes on my
shoulder
 Yeah cats are the best I dont know
theres a trap door up there but I mean were
not going in
 Well done there yeah What do we want to
do This place is full of sick people
 Yeah And if were going in what do we do
We could have one of us be ill perhaps
 Yeah
 A better idea perhaps is for one of
Youre able to disguise yourself right
 Theres three of us that we can all
disguise ourselves I can make myself look like
like a sick person
 Well you can make yourself look like you
but with not green skin
 There is some sort of trapdoor in the center
of that building that I dont think is mirrored by
any of the rooms that I was able to see on the
outside of the building So its like a donut with
a hole in the middle is where maybe what youre
looking for
 Yeah Ruckus you and I go in
 Couldnt you maybe act like
 Could you be a sick tiefling
 When we go in we dont walk in just you and
me We do Mothers Love
 Just in case
 Yeah show us the goods What did you do to
yourself Oh
 I will have Jester sketch it out and we will
have it forever
 Were going to hang back Is there a nook or
an alley within view of this
 Can we go half a block away
 Yeah thats fine for the moment For the
moment yeah Get ready were going to do
Mothers Love
 Were going to watch them at the door
 The ruckus is audible all the way down the
block so I turn myself into a halforc woman and
pick up Nott like my baby and put her head on my
shoulder and start walking towards the building
 We peer in the door What is going on in
this room at this point
 We are going to go between them like Noah
through the water Oh thats the wrong  Moses yeah
 Theres vomit and eggs everywhere
 I will take the left one if the clerk went
down the right side
 
 Frumpkin appears on the back of the guys
neck and starts tearing in
 Oh my gosh for a cat I mean its a 
plus I dont know what
 Starts clawing One
 Is there enough chaos for us to step into
one of these open rooms and shut the door behind us
 Look for an empty room Or is every room in
the house full
 I go in and shut the door behind us
 A one
 Yeah but hes in the office
 We dont know Thats a no were working
together Were trying to work together with
people No we have to get all of us out of here
which is more important than finding this asshole
in the building What do we do what do we do
 That seems extreme at this moment
 Lets go Out we go
 I wasnt saying that but I dont mind
 No but well go down the hall towards the
front of the building to look for I would assume
Fjord and Molly at this point
 Is Fjord alone in this room
 I turn and show him Nott
  Fever She has a fever
 Wait so whos where outside
 Pointing at us Okay
  That still seems extreme We should
just book it
 Only a ten for me
 I think I was imagining a small momandpop
place with two physicians but like  people in
white coats came out
 I think it was more like  Matt lets be
honest
 Oh that only took five minutes to go that
bad
 Thats true it came very close
 So you looked at the house and then you went
shopping
 Tight thats tight
 Not my face
 Yeah agreed In hospitals you see all
nature of people
 No there was not a lot of
 There was not a lot of talking in fact
 Well it could add credibility to the
tapestry that were trying to weave here The goal
is still to get into Sutan elders home and get
this seal
 Within the writings that we forge we could
include some by the junior Sutan so that would
add some credibility to what were doing
 We still have to figure out what we are
going to if we are starting at Sutans house
then We dont have any writing of the
HighRichters we are either trying to focus on
finding that somehow or going on what you were
discussing which is creating the appearance of an
underling or a forhire of the HighRichters or
some kind of code saying that they are
communicating with Sutan elder on behalf of the
HighRichter yeah
 Experience as a what
 We want to put information in Sutans
house elder right We could have some sort of
writing that is not from the HighRichter but
that says HR would prefer the plans to go into motion
 I propose that we make it seem like Sutan
and the HighRichter were conspiring to have
Orentha killed So we have a note put into Sutans
intermediary On behalf of HR wants the plan to
go into motion immediately and that Orentha will
be out for the festival tonight
 The Big O That is good
 Then we plant that in Sutan elders house
when we successfully quietly break in
 Well its an intermediary so does not have
to look
 This letter perhaps on its own is not
enough but with the seal if we have a matching
letter planted in HRs home
 Keep your writing very plain Not immensely
charming
 No I mean not charming like the way you
speak
 No No
 Yeah thats good
 HR would like the plan to be moved
forward
 The plan is moving up to tomorrow night at
the festival
 The moment has come and it is time for us
to seize it
 To chase it away
 We dont want a dead dog
 Yeah Frumpkin can do that very well
 Also sausages are very inexpensive so we
have that as a Plan B
 Are they private guards though or are they
crownsguard
 Do you know what Nott if you want one
idea if you want to help is you can also write a
note in your Thieves Cant It should be vague on
details but a message from the Myriad Or dont
even get that specific but write in Thieves
Cant a note saying that everything is in place
for the festival
 No but I think we should go back to the
hospital one more time
 Is he at the hospital
 Where did you get these items
 Under the Leaky Tap And you found
 You found a skeleton
 You found a dead person
 Yeah but its not really typical to keep a
dead like a skeleton in your basement
 Well thats a topic for the group Were
staying in an inn where there was a dead person
 Yeah thats worse Thats not better
thats worse
 Okay well thats somewhat unsettling but
show me these items that you have
 I place them down on the bed and go through
the process of casting Identify on them It takes
about ten minutes
 You should sell these These are not little
and adorable like buttons
 Do you want to wear them
 Well you could What
 Are they huge for a goblins little wrists
 Maybe your ankle or calf you could put them
on Or sell them and then you could put them to use
 Im still a little disturbed that theres a
dead person under this inn that were in right
now
 Well I take your word for it that its
there I dont need to go poking about
 Well it is a spell that I learned when I
was
 You could potentially learn this as well
 Of course If you apply yourself
 How do you mean Im not very strong Nott
I do have things that I want to do with my life
and I mean to apply myself and study and find
knowledge
 Ja That is the best way to do that For
anyone
 That seems like an abstract question There
are certainly very useful things that can be found
in this world You never know
 Are you okay
 Well thank you friend
 Well maybe we go to bed and tomorrow we
dont tear the roof down off of every building we
go into again yeah
 So I take out my silver thread and I start
casting the Alarm spell on our room before bed
and then I go to bed
 Mess with the bull get the horns
 Yeah and if you are actually in the dark
you cant tell the difference and if youre in
the light you look like a ninja so I think were
good maybe
 Yeah in a pinch
 A lot is riding on Sutan and the
HighRichter going to this festival
 Thats it thats all

 No its just pessimism
 Well I worry that if we break into Sutans
house and stuff a bunch of letters there but the
HighRichter stays in with a tummy ache then it
all falls apart
 Yeah lead the way Ill be the caboose
 Ill pick up some sausages
 Oh just the one string of them Four or
five
 Two strings in case

 Okay put it down on the ground
 Ah well then use a hearth fire or
something because I will probably put that into
flames Also alternatively would we want maybe
something instead that said that the Knights are
ready for this evenings pursuits and theyre to
support any endeavors as needed great
HighRichter It is time for change
 Yes the two together but I worry that just
the one piece she could have written it down on a
list of things she does not like its not very
conclusive But the two together
 Have you written your letter in your
thieves thingy that you do
 Thats in Sutans place
 Good we want to tie Sutan to the Myriad
and HighRichter to the Knights and HighRichter
and Sutan together Thats the plan
 Yes to take that seat To enact the change
that the people need
 Did we get paid in advance by the way
 Did we get half of it even
 We should also youre invisible We should
also discuss whos going in whos outside how we
are tackling each house
 How does it work
 Then youre right you should go in Nott
you should go in because youre going to pick
locks ja
 If anything is locked I strongly believe
that I should go in as well because these are two
very wealthy powerful people and there could be
magical
 Only if that is you know easy to do
 And the sausage just in case
 Regardless even if this goes bellyup we
just disappear You know we have no ties to this
we walk away yeah We just get out with our
skins even if things go as badly as they did at
the hospital and then we go we just walk away
 Oh also Frumpkin is up here in my sort of
scarf position and I bring him down in my lap
and I take the sausages out and I sort of like
knead one of the sausages in my hand a bit and I
say you know Im sorry but the next time that
you go off to your pocket place and come back
this will be gone And I start squishing sausage
grease into his hair and rubbing it down his back
so that he smells like sausage
 I love you very much so thank you for this
okay
 Some other time perhaps
 Eight
 I send Frumpkin screeching away from us up
the street clattering into anything
 Yeah out of the sewer yeah I pop him back
up
 Caleb appears at the sewer like Pennywise
the Clown
 I held back two minutes to let Frumpkin
quietly come back
 Can I insight check him Just get a feel for
that
 That is 
 Guys its Larkin
 May I also do the same thing
 No no good Eight
 This is a lot of people
 I rolled well
 
 Im sorry Can you set the scene Two guards
at one end and one at the other
 And its like cornercorner or front and
back or
 Okay
 The guard with the dog is within this
perimeter of fence
 To the front side of the home
 Maybe temporary though
 Yeah but what about our exit Because we
have to come back out
 No no we worry about that now
 I dont like being stuck in there though
 Also I have another question How far from
the fence to the home
 Five feet only
 Im rethinking If Frumpkin gets away from
this dog in the beginning he can run outside the
fence and he will not be far from me I can stay
in touch with him so when its time to leave I
can have Frumpkin reenter the yard and create
mayhem a second time
 We might not but if we have no other option
and were trying to get out and theres guards in
both places Frumpkin can come in and create
mayhem again Anyway just an option
 Hes just a cat
 A natural sound
 Hows the weather is it clear or grey
 Well shes got to get up there first
 She didnt roll that good
 
 Frumpkin is pacing back and forth just
outside the fence
 She is really cool
 Only Frumpkin is down at the bottom of the
tree He runs around and
 Yeah I think
 Wait hold on Is there entry through the
roof
 We cant see from here
 A chimney stack
Were not Santa Claus
 Im sending Frumpkin now okay
 Where are they in relation to us too by the
way
 I want to know if youre within view of the
guard with the dogs initial position
 So what I would do is also once were in
position on the roof is I would tell Frumpkin to
back off away from that dog out of vision and
wait a few minutes because hes within a hundred
feet of me If so were good Tell him to find
Molly and sit with Molly Hell always listen to
me but Im also sending him the command to listen
to Molly if need be
 You dont know that But still
 What were you saying I did not hear you
 Yeah good we covered If we do the
shingles how do we cover them up when we leave
Were trying to leave no trace
 I have a dagger
 No get them Get them
 Look out giant red dragons
 I drop in after Beauregard and I cast Detect
Magic immediately
  feet
 You know we want to be efficient here
Quick
 Yes save more time to doing so Lets start
moving And youre looking for bad physical things
 Whats the light situation like in here
 Yeah
 Hells yes
 Okay
 Do I know the school of magic
 Theres no magical aura from those at all
Those are separate Youre not saying
 Okay
 The spell says I know the school of magic
for whats on these things You able to tell me that
 If you dont know how to answer its fine
  Breaking the law Breaking the
law
 Okay Ja
 Im an expert in edubation 
Thats Liam not Caleb
 Okay but I dont know exactly how these
work but I have a strong suspicion that these
things can start moving and try to cut us up Both
these suits of armor and that weapon
 Maybe
 Hopefully things will go very well but
theres a chance that this thing that you are
indicating is not connected to those so be ready
to fight
 This Is Exciting
 I wish I was still a rogue its the best
class
 I walk up behind Nott and scan the room with
the spell
 Im just walking up behind Nott no further
and looking in to see what glows
 What kind of magic is emanating from the
carpet What school of magic
 I alert everyone The carpet is magical
 I do not
 I have a question The carpet reeks of
abjuration or I would know that the carpet is magical
 Transmutation If the carpet is magical I
wouldnt
 Right The carpet seems magical to me I
wouldnt think that something under the carpet is magical
 Do I see any change in the abjuration magic
when she does that
 What you just did dispelled whatever ward
was on the cabinet however the carpet I cant
tell exactly whats going on but there is
something
 Its an animated object
 My kids have fought a broom This happens
 I would be by Beau because I clapped her on
the shoulder
  You are not prepared oh
no
 Well you know I rolled a nine
  Youre the best around Nothings
ever going to bring you down
 We damage it
 No I understand but we damage it
 No one knows who the fuck knows
 You learned its badass
 Next Moving on
 Oh Ulog is a little girl
 Yeah I pull the potion of healing I have
out of my belt and I run over to Nott and I jam
it into her mouth and pour it in The whole time
Im going through my list of spells thinking of
Dancing Lights Fire Bolt Friends Alarm Burning
Hands Chromatic Orb Comprehend Languages Detect
Magic And I heal Nott
  points
 Greater
 Hes killing our nostalgia for the carpet
 He would have had to have told me that there
was magic anywhere else in the room
 Right was physical Thats true
 Come on you are a badass You can do it
 Youre the best of all of us
 Wait did you roll a  and an eight
 Come on Beau
 Who wore it best
 No shes not out
Shes hanging on
 Ja
 What am I doing I rush forward and I am
going to try to pry the rug off of her
 Ja Come on roll big Nope
Athletics Nein
 Next
 Thats okay because if the plan goes
according to plan yeah Allow myself to introduce
myself If everything goes well we get Orentha to
fall on both of these people at once So lets
finish what were doing ja
 Ja doesnt matter No one is going to
care about a rug or him screaming about a rug
 Check that armoire or whatever it is
 Check them both
 Hes got a safe and a floor
 No more magic
 Son of a gun
 Motherfucker
 What about Ulog
 Because its simultaneous
 What is in there with Ulog
 All magical I assume I assume theyre
glowing
 Yeah I havent cast anything that breaks
that
 Nott just collapsed on the floor
paralyzed
 I pull the chest free of Notts hands Is
this chest glowing
 We have that already We did it in advance
I start rooting through Notts pockets to find the
letter in Thieves Cant
 Yeah Thieves Cant were leaving here
 So we should leave them here
 From Richter to Sutan we did so were
leaving those and were leaving a note
 Notts fake Myriad note were leaving here
so I pull that out of Notts pockets
 While Jester and Caleb are arguing Caleb
grabs the little magical stone thats in that box
and puts it in his pocket
 Got to do it
 Weve left the Thieves Cant note from the
Myriad and weve left the
Yeah Everything that weve planned
 Is anything glowing there though Matthew
 Okay
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Athletics check For everybody right
 Come on Tal
 Work that shit This is
 How far away is where the grapple is hooked
from us right now
 I cast Unseen Servant Schmidt lifts up the
grapple and tosses it free
 Wow
 We need to get to our next target
immediately
 Everybodys going to the same place
 What if she came home with some crazy
outfit Crazy cloak
 How high is the wall
 Seven foot Frumpkins on top of the wall
What do I see
 Are there any people
 Yeah I relayed that all to them Theres
nobody back there right Yeah Seven feet tall Easy
 Youre going up
 Im going in with her Kneel down Im going
to climb up on his back and start to try to climb
 
 Oh he leaps I was going to say seeing
that argument that I dropped down to the ground
on the other side And not help him
 I cast Detect Magic
 I grab both of her shoulders and peer in to
see if anything glows
 What do we see What do we see where we
are
 Doors out of here
 No We move forward You ten feet in front
of me I will look for magic you will look for
physical obstacles Here we go
  Checking for magic
 No
 A kraken
 Can you message the others
 Were moving through the foyer
 Girl
 Nott and Caleb are still going up the
stairs
 Have the vagrants caught up yet
 Detect Magic wipe in this room
 Leave that box that case that box be
careful
 No its not fine
 What is the type of magic emanating from the
case
 Evo  thats bad
 
 Also there is no other magic around this
room in the walls or anything right
 Youve indicated everything thats here
 Yeah I grab the scroll case
 You have to detect that I did it
 Of course I did
 Are you in the room
 Okay
 Eight
 No Im taking this
 Im taking this This isnt worth my time
Im taking this
 I walk out
 Seven
 Unconscious
 I was doing death saves and it was not going
well Just for shits and giggles

 Five
 Give it to me
 Age
 Not us
 No I dont think so
 We need to go find a shitty place and lay
low
 The stone
 Oh
 We are walking away
 What is it
 Ah  Dancing Lights
 I cast Comprehend Languages
 That is verbal somatic and material A
pinch of soot of salt which I throw out in front of me
 People from Xhorhas
 No
 Trust the porn
 Edubate once a day
 Oh Fjord it is over Bromance is over
 Shes dead The owner is dead
 They are shitty selfish ones
 
 Yeah you go first
 Okay so I will go I will destroy the
initiative ranking I will send my globules of
light into the darkness to see if it has any
effect
 And then Im going to back up
 No lets say two of them
 At the same time I will back up my full
movement while Frumpkin runs into the edge of that
darkness
 Frumpkin will run forward out of the
darkness
 Towards the action Yeah and poke his head
out actually closer to Hell come out between
Mollys legs Peek right out there Im sitting
down in the muck in the sewer and Im now watching
and listening to use Comprehend Languages through
Frumpkin
 I like that an eightyearold boy delivered
those points
 Barnacle blow
 You just did that like the glitter guy
Blood Maledict
 This language spell runs out in an hour
lets speed this up
 Between the couch cushions
 Do they say In Xhorhas We Trust on them
 Oh let me take a look at it
 What Does anybody have a torch or anything
No
 Okay I need ten minutes Ten minutes with
this thing Im going to as a ritual spell cast Identify
 On the dodecahedron
  But its next level shit
 Oh
 Yeah I throw a dirty rag over it
 It is extremely powerful whatever it is
 No
 What do we want our next step to be
 
 I was going to say lets wake up the elf
 Well I dont remember it but Caleb does
because he has photographic memory So Matt has to
tell me

 There is always some truth to porn
 Caleb says
 Jester my idea is you know most people
are not like that crownsguard bastard Most people
like cats so maybe if Frumpkin woke him up you
know with a couple of licks he would wake up in
a better
 Thats also true
 Its all yours
 Comprehend Languages I understand
everything
 He thinks were with the empire
 Do we have any of that Crownsguard armor
Didnt we collect some
 Jester give me one of the Crownsguard
helmets from your backpack
 I take this helmet I set it on the ground
in front of the elf and then I start to piss on it
 Frumpkin comes over and also pisses on it
 I shake it and put it away
 Can you yeah
 I cast a spell so I could try to understand
your tongue
 Its under a dirty rag
 What is your intention for the people in
this empire this kingdom
 No your peoples intention for all those
who live here
 Yeah you know that deepdish pizza there
 What will you do if we say no
 We leave him only if we leave the beacon
with the Gentleman but if we leave him on his own
 I think that this thing is a great
responsibility
 I think we should kill him
 Seems dangerous to me
 It does
 If we leave this gentleman here and take the
beacon it becomes his lifes work to find us
 So we either leave him and it or we take it
and kill him
 I dont why are you
 I dont Its on the ground under the dirty
rag ja
 Im going to take a few steps back
 These two individuals were responsible for
blowing a hole in that tower yes
 Im not contradicting what youre saying
Im sorry When you say What use do we have for
it Its a dangerous thing
 What do they do there I dont know much
about the Cobalt Soul What can you tell me
 Question When he said Thuron did I hear
Thuron or did I hear some other word like eagle
or swift or something
 So I didnt hear Bob right Did it have
a
 Same question
 Context of the name Anything
 No were in the Dwendalian Empire
 Thats close to a death sentence How about
we give him some crownsguard armor
 I suggest leave it for him
 I defer to the group
 Say what
 I am able to tell a great many things about
a great many things and that is beyond me
 I do not
 Were taking his shit
 He left all his shit his armor hes
wearing but all his other shit was left around
 We scooped it up
 Where he went
 Well whatever it is the empire just got it
back
 Also as a sidebar if we want the other
half of our earlier plan to work we need to get
to Dolan we need the crownsguard inside Sutans
house as quickly as possible
 That could have easily been a blank piece of
paper
 It wasnt
 I looked at it plenty
 Sure All the question marks I memorized
all the question marks
 No that was too mysterious
 All right come on were going back up
Were either fighting crownsguard or getting out
of here
 Its a long story go
 One two three Dont know who youre
point oh everybody
 We took cover in the sewers
 Has the danger passed
 
 
 That is correct right We have not been
paid
 I send Frumpkin scurrying between peoples
legs into the crowd put my hand on Beaus
shoulder and go blind
 Do Frumpkin and I see the doohickus The
dodecahedron
 Im going to cast Disguise Self as a
crownsguard and just follow Just see whats
happening
 Dont drop it Dont drop it
 As a crownsguard I was walking alongside
 I start doing that thing where I was taking
steps but not walking with them And then I
started walking backwards

 I thought it was like black and glowing
Its white and glowing
 Pretty good for me Pretty good for me
Thats 
 Yeah Dressed as a crownguard
 One in my hand and one on the ground But
Ive got it like this
 Oh I just want to get it away from the
crowd This thing seems dangerous to me
 Lets just a little further back like
another ten feet I dont know if this is going to
blow Its better that its just you and me
 So whats around
 Yeah good so I cast Friends on this
crownsguard
 No Its not concentration
 It is
 Yeah advantage to charisma rolls If hes
not under attack or thinks hes threatened
 Advantage on charisma checks at one creature
of your choice that isnt hostile towards you
 So listen Dont die for this I will take
this Just walk ahead This thing blew a hole in
the side of that tower
 Okay 
 The first was a one
 Weve seen balls of fire take out half a
city block
 I turn into an alley
 Wait are there other guards around me Im
sorry
 Does that give me advantage
 Stealth
 It is a nine
 Are there any doors or anything in here
 Ill take the left
 And just keep going
 Ordinarily I would say yes and I might
want to put something else in there But for the
time being I dont understand this thing enough
 Lets table that for now Im worried what
will happen if this specifically goes into that bag
 Because that is an extradimensional
pocket
 And I dont know what this is and I am
worried that it could potentially create
 Sure lets go with that But maybe if we
could procure a lead box to put this inside of
that will shield it from any possible searching
that could happen for it
 A large lead box yeah
 We need to find Dolan fast We need to Im
serious find a lead box to put this thing in
because someones going to want this very badly
 I wish I could be a fly on the wall when
those wizards hear this story from the
crownsguard just like
  Yes very good Take
a lollipop from the bowl and get out

 You think the basement with a dead person is
safe
 What is a super long time Like ten years
What is that
 Thats a conversation for another day Lets
go
 Just a shitty hardware store man
 Okay well Im going to take my cloak off
and cover it
 Ive changed my mind I think it can wait
until morning but for sure Well if she has
one good but its a lot of disarray
 Well then lets go break into a store and
get a lead box
 Not that particular material
 Because lead shields things from magical
from divination magic
 But I would know that when I saw it I know
alchemy I know all sorts of materials
 For now
 Good Thats it That is a great idea
 The big bad of campaign two
 I will say that on the walk I would
instantly Identify the stone
 Identify
 From Sutans house
 Onceaday walkietalkie
 Yes I am
 I go take a look at this skeleton I would
like to try to ascertain how long this fucker has
been here
 Yeah Not great at all like all my skill
rolls Seven
 Heres the thing We can hide this here
Its a calculated risk which I am fan of
generally But my thread my magic would let me
know if someone no never mind
 No I can put a magical lock on the door to
this basement as well As well as an alarm
 Well the thread will allow me me to know if
someone I didnt want to be in here came in here

 But you know I think you and I should
sleep down here tonight actually
 Yes

 I worry well Ill tell you my concerns
and that is that this thing is beyond
comprehension even And the desire to get it back
is going to be great This and I pull out the
Sending Stone is just a stone that I stole from
Sutans house This Im not worried about Would
you put this in your backpack please
 Oh youre not with us Ill have to ask
Jester to put this in her backpack
 But this thing was worth blowing up a tower
for
 You cannot spy on a thing as far as I know
You can spy on a place You can spy on a person
 This is why I want the lead box
 All right
 Okay Well lets hide it
 Ja From normal people I put the same
shitty rag on it that was on it before
 Two plus three Thats five
 Molly and Caleb put the skull on top of it
together
 Did you say there were crates down here
too
 Okay
 I really think we should stay down here with
it
 Why dont you and I stay down here for the
night You have anything you want me to identify
leave it I can do that You know what I have Im
not leaving
 I will stay with this thing You go up When
they come back you come back down My gut tells
me to stay close to this thing
 Im glad
 The entrance to this is in the back of the
building right
 Well Nott you go up You can just Message
me
 Yeah and you come down here
 When they leave Im going to take the big
item and put it on my person Im going to hold
it actually
 I am not like looking into the abyss I
just dont understand it and Im just holding it there
 Okay
 Jester had all the shit right
 Cue the horror strings violin
screeching
 Jesters face pushes through the door
 Give her advantage Oh my god
 Can I come in now
 How about now
 It was like a Pokmon though
 Hanging out with my new friend
 Everybody is dead down here
 Make believe is tricky guys
 Just a quick aside while all of this is
going on I place the thing in my lap and I pick
up the skull Oh so many secrets huh Yorick
 Maybe you should tear it off your chest 
I dont think thats a good idea
Its driving you crazy 
Maybe not yet
Its probably a good idea 
Youre funny
 Were going to drag this out as long as
possible
 Tell them Im not going to run off with it
 What about in the game
 Oh that was so brief That was like five
minutes ago
 Hows it going up there
 Its a scroll case right
 Does anybody know you took
this
 I set it on the ground I pull Nott closer
to me and I give Nott a kiss on the forehead
Thank you
 Yeah
 You are too kind to me
 Well you know I think maybe you have
guessed it before now but I care a great deal
for you and that is no small gift Thank you
 Another day You know a little bit of me is
worried that this scroll case will explode so I
think we should check that out first
 Yeah okay I can get this done in about an
hour I think First Nott will you take the
scroll case and put it on the other side of the
room
 Yeah Im tapped so this is all ritual
spells now So I will use a ritual spell to
Identify the scroll case
 How big is this room down here
 Okay
 This is going to be funny I take another
ten minutes to summon Schmidt
 Come with me outside okay
 Okay Schmidt go open the scroll case Come
on I shut the door
 That is what I was afraid of
 So at this point back up a little bit and
I open the door and back up to see what I see
 I back away from it
 So not a ball of fiery death
 Okay so its cleared away Schmidts gone
I assume
 Well if it wasnt damagedealing hes
still there
 He has two One or two
 One hit point
 Okay so its clear Next ritual spell that
I will cast I will gather the other items except
for the dodecahedron
 Well were about to find out The
dodecahedron is in my satchel at this point I
push all the other items towards the case and
whatever is there and I use ritual magic to
cast Detect Magic everywhere I just cast it
 I rearrange my satchel so its back by my
butt so I dont have to look right at it Okay
we have a little bit of work to do I pick up the
scrolls and examine them
 
 Come here come here
 I pick her up and I hug her
 This will be good for the group this will
be good for you and me this is good Its
something that I was not able to do Ive been
trying to figure it out for months and I have not
been able to figure it out and now I have it
 Okay lets look at these things for
everybody else Okay Ho ho ho lets Identify
all this shit I spend the next  or so
minutes
 Ah Yeah
 Beau might like these These are good Yeah
these are good Okay so All right well put
these away This is a very good blade This might
be a good blade for you Why dont you hold on to
it You hold onto that
 Oh Let me see I thought that was the
daggers
 So the daggers are not magic
 Not magic
 No this is bigger than you
 Fjord or Molly would like this They can
decide They can decide I mean really these
boots are good for anybody These are good for
yeah
 No Ill tell you on Christmas morning and
not before
 We couldnt do this at all last campaign
Now you have to wait  minutes
 Oh boy
 Why
 That is the red flag Not the arcane rug
that was destroyed and removed covering his
precious things Not Jester disguising herself as
the HighRichter
 And leaving witnesses who had seen someone
who was not the Richter going in before the Richter
 Yeah Ulog rifled through her desk and took
some papers from there but I did not see Fjord
tear him a new asshole
 Well you know I want this to work So
whatever they need I definitely do not agree but
whatever makes it work
 Well I have no interest in being a leader
do you
 No
 Do you know that I was going to go to that
school one day
 Yeah Didnt work out
 Oh I didnt get anywhere near it Im from
a small town and there was a lot of hubbub for
me and maybe you know a gatheringup of coin But
I fucked it up
  Yeah
  That is not for me to say
But I have no interest in going I will do it on
 Thats the idea Ja
 Yeah well you know anything worth going
after takes some elbow grease and hard work so
 I havent had a friend in a very long time
The last few months have been unexpected
 I do not And Ill tell you another secret
I like them too I get that theyre angry I
dont agree with them But I get it
 Or you I would argue
 Well you want to bed down with a
terrifying artifact of awesome power
 Okay
 Okay
 Night Nott
 Get out of here
 I love you guys I dont mean the Mighty
Nein youre assholes but I love you guys
 We did it We reclaimed our dignity We did
it
 Oh man here comes my extra one hit point
 Plus my con modifier its a total of six
So Im sitting at a big  now
 Wow This aint your kids DD right there
 Yeah
 Sure Ive just been nerding out over my
leveling up over here
 Oh I rolled a one Matthew
 I rolled it really badly Im not good at
dice
 It doesnt always work out for you anyway
 It can be thin as a sheet of parchment
 It doesnt need to be as Am I here Ive
been doing this with my spells
 It needs to be sealed all the way around and
be able to close
 Are we all in a group though Sorry I
really did have my head up the ass of level four
 Okay
 Like a lead I would pay premium price to
get a hold of a lead box right away
 Yeah but this is more like an experience
like Sleep No More You have to go and
 Yeah you have to see it for yourself We do
have a lot to do but this is a functional trip as well
 This is a functional trip as well A
gentleman like Pumat Sol gentlemen like Pumat
Sols would most likely because they understand
divination and the needs of the arcane
 We want you to be in on it
 Yeah he would not be surprised by the
question
 Also come over here Please
 Well whoever everybody hears this Come
closer Yeah so
 I look around to see if anyone was
distracted by Fjords large belch
 All right I know youre all a big fan of my
sticky fingers I took this from Sutans house
 It is a sending stone Its a communication
device This was in Sutans house This was under
the rug that we destroyed and removed
 Yes of course We did what we had to do We
have to improvise This stone has a twin somewhere
and we can talk with it I dont know who it is
Honestly my opinion is the probability of
someone trying to find us searching for this
thing is like looking for a needle in a haystack
in a newly made warzone However in the meantime
I was wondering if youd hold it inside of your
fancy bag because
 I believe not because inside your bag is
somewhere else It is not even on this plane
 Lets put that in your bag right away because 
we dont know whats on the other side of it
 There is a very very small chance the answer 
is yes so please put it in your bag right now
 Yeah That is what I said that I was going
to do
 Do we want to do it before Pumat or after
Pumat
 All we could do is say hello to a stranger
We dont know who it is
 It would hear our voice
 That is true Just keep it in the bag for
now just in case
 Yeah We could certainly roll this over in
our minds and see if theres something we could do
with it If someone is going to look for this
thing and again probability very low but if
they were going to look itd be right away Itd
be a couple of weeks
 I believe possible that at some point a
message could come through it
 But we dont know I just want for the
next two to four weeks I would prefer to keep it
either in a leadlined container or in that bag Chances
are small but if someone was really determined
 Its possible
 I would agree with Fjords sentiment If we
took it out of my own bag Theres four of Pumats
so one of those Pumats would see it coming out of
my own stuff
 Yeah thats also true
 No that hes nice
 We could also go to a breakfast shop and do
it there
  Respectfully we are
 Sorry how much precisely was that one
again
 She is very useful in the right
circumstances
 We definitely should I will buy that box
for us How much was it
 Also I assume it is out of my reach
pricewise and Im on a budget but do you deal
in arcane knowledge Preprepared scrolls of any
kind
 What is the range What are your lowest
rung I guess Im curious to know
 DM a question from Liam Can cantrips be
added if theyre found
 Okay
 You know I am interested in everything from
the second level and below Do you have a menu
 Give me a moment Players Handbook
 Hold your horses
 No I am very good thank you
 Oh no
 Lets get back to business I dont know
what you have on tap here but Im looking for
something just a cantrip pretty common
shocking
 You know how it works
 That is the one
 Excellent Pause The other thing
 The other one that I am interested in that
is not really my forte but many wizards believe
it is of great benefit Do you have the Shield
spell
 How much will that run me
 I will take the pair
 I will take those Thank you very much
Herr Sol
 That is Arschloch so no
 Which
 Whos on first
 Fiction or
 Well sum it up for me Give me the Tensers
Floating Disk pitch
 We can relate Im a big reader If you
finish that I dont know if you are the kind of
fellow who likes to keep every book he reads
but
 Oh ja that makes sense Okay Well I
will look for it elsewhere thank you
 Oh okay
 Would you be able to put in an order for
this book for me
 I understand but you know many people You
are obviously a very knowledgeable fellow who has
vast connections
 Its a dirty book
 All right Well I wait for your full
review Thank you
 True I got distracted You know
 So I put the box right down next to me and I
put my coat
 Okay So this is better than it was before
You have monster calves do you want to carry this now
 I am
 No people carry boxes
 The lead is just to protect this item from
divination
 I am worried about crossing two planes of
existence It might not be that at all but it is
definitely not worth chancing
 Tell me
 What you have experience with things of
this nature
 Okay well thats fine Im going to walk
about  feet away from you when you put it in
that bag
 It takes about two weeks so I guess well
find out
 Oh yes very good things
 The daggers are just daggers okay
 Who cares about daggers honestly But
this I hold up this longsword which I can barely
hold up This would be good for either of you two
I will let you decide Fjord here This is a very
strong sword it is very good against creatures
That is for you to look at Then these boots would
make anyone better but I think that Beauregard
might benefit from them the most I could be
wrong Im going to give them to Beau and let you
decide
 Theres another one its just gone
missing
 I mean we will probably never see her
again that seems a little foolish to me
 Could one of us carry it until she returns
Who could really use it
 Not you You are so good with a sword
 Of course yes
 I thought you would like those Was I right
I was right wasnt I
 Once per day So you can choose a moment 
to get the jump
 I mean anybody would but
 Yeah but you know Beauregard really is the
most capable fighter in this group at this moment
in time What Thats just the truth Can you
handle the truth
 Oh I love making people happy
 But also we did not get the full catchup
Fjord What about the remnants of I know
everything is verkakte The HighRichter is
dead thats half the job done in a way we did not
predict but what about Lord Sutan Did you talk
to Dolan And are they going to get the
Crownsguard in there
 We cant do anything Dolan was going to
handle that part of this
 Absolutely noticed that the very expensive
magical rug is gone
 Listen this could all appear like the
Knights turned on the HighRichter I thought we
wanted to get rid of Lord Sutan
 Yeah
 And actual connections to the Myriad
 Itll flip the situation Dolan I believe
was saying that with the HighRichter in place
she was favoring Sutan And now she is gone Dolan
will hopefully take that seat If he takes that
seat Dolan is not going to protect Lord Sutan in
the way that he claimed that the HighRichter was
 I dont know maybe we walk away from the
whole thing Discuss it as a possibility
 Well heres the thing If Dolan assumes that
seat we have no idea if thats going to happen
but if Dolan does take that Richters seat Sutan
if nothing happens to him if no guards go into
Sutans house he knows that his rug is gone he
realizes someone has been in his home  he
looks through the home himself finds our fake
message from the Myriad or whoever would he
retaliate on Dolan Do we care
 Well it was Dolan who said I believe he
had the relationship with Orentha so he was going
to report this stuff to Orentha and have
crownsguard go in Now due to the circumstances
of the evening we have missed the element of a
quick surprise They did not rush in the way we
had hoped So hes already realized somebody has
jacked his shit Im not worried really about
him finding us but he had a bad night when he
came home
 But if we dont give a shit about Dolan
then theres no problem really But maybe we do
 This is just the first layer of the onion
Theres eight more names to come
 You fakenamemaking motherfucker
 Thats it Youre in the clear
 You are like a bad penny
 Theres nothing private about our situation
at all right Theres people everywhere
 And it all makes sense to you
 I apologize Im not very observant I
missed your name
 Cree
 You were mentioning this group the Tomb
Takers You had another name before Were you a
group and our friend joined you at some point
 The one that came before
 What was your unifying trait or pursuit
 Shes going Homer Simpson running circles
around

  Jester wants you to know that
from home she is watching The Gentleman and making
sure he is not cheating

 That was mine

 Still a game
 Flex
 The Mighty Drei
 While that conversation happens Can I speak
to you Just for a second
 That was a princely sum you just wagered
with there
 Yes it is That wouldnt have by any
chance have been recompense for everything we did
the other night Or are you rolling in it
 Yeah Im wondering if you just wagered
the partys funds On a very calculated risk
 So you come with funds on you
 Do you know I would be all right if you
had I am a fan of calculated risks
 Yeah But it was just you know Youre
flush I understand
 Insight check
 
 All right
 If the reward is good and its not stupid
 Maybe Okay
 How many names are there Is it over ten or
under
 With one of your long fingernails
 Write what you know Taliesin
 Taliesin theres tabaxis coming out of every
stall What the hell man
 That is true Do you think you will be able
to travel with us for a little while perhaps
 No pressure at all but it is nice to have
some muscle around
 She is just joshing you
 We have been getting our hands dirty a
little bit Are you sure you want to get your
hands dirty with us
 Thats direct
  Technically we stole it from the
crownsguard because he took it away so we stole
it later
 Depends on who youre talking to
 How long have you been in the Empire
 How long have you been here in the Empire
 What do you mean people are listening to
heavy metal GWAR babe purple guy and little
green girl in a doll mask
 Im going to have Frumpkin jump into Notts
lap and do the  on her fingers to keep
her occupied
  Ashley Ashleys back Ashleys
back in the game shes back in the game and shes
never going back and Blindspot is no more Well
maybe it is were just not sure were waiting to
find out
 Jester why are you smearing feces all over
your face
 Yeah you could shoulder that motherfucker
 Nott maybe you could use it You know for
laughs
 You could do the pole vault
 Thats a shame
 I will go with you if you want If you want
us to ask this
 To the ogre
 Lets go
 This is a peoplebuilding exercise
 Hes good pouring a flask like that
 Important note
 Laura Bailey has texted in
that she hates us all
 Sure This is easy Were all going to die
 Yeah
 This is a guy it is a male ogre
 I also grab Jester by the wrist and drag her
along because she makes everyone smile so I
bring her with Yeah hello I am sorry to bother
you but I think that we are loosely connected
through work relations now This is my friend
Nott this is Jester My name is Caleb Widogast
and we are working for the Gentleman much like
you are We are going to be here
 You know we dont want to take up too much
of your time I was just hoping to learn two
things One what is your name
 I wipe the warm breath off of my face
 And my second question is
 do you like
working for the Gentleman
 I will take that as a yes I am glad we are
doing business with this gentleman
 Kutha
 We had the loveliest time it was a great
day please check it out
 Additionally DD Beyond has offered to
donate  for every natural one rolled by the
Mighty Nein up until June including every
natural one rolled to date making a positive out
of our misery
 Suns on its way down you said
 It has set okay
 This is a good time to mention that in
between last game and this
 cantrips not
 Right but Caleb would have known that
 After Liam had asked the DM
 So were switching out that cantrip for Hold
Person if that was at the store
 And Caleb is flat broke Until right now
 You blindfold him on the way to being
blindfolded
 Oh
 Oh
 Six of one half a dozen of another Order
of the story
 
 Why do you have so many names
 You woke up buried in the ground
 And you are saying that you have no memory
 Keeping it real on the field line
 Well you can say whatever you want but
whatever you say has to be true Thats how it
works You can also just say I dont feel like
talking
 Wow
 
 But DM we know that we feel it according
to the spell
 Yeah but do you have any theories for what
happened before
 How much time passed between waking up in a
dirt box and the circus
 Yeah many
 Are you a good guy
 Are you talking about your abilities
  Oh I have a question Is there
anyone in the group you find super attractive
 A text from Laura
 Oh ask Yasha oh
  What about you
  You can tell me
 Yasha how much of this was under wraps You
knew any of this in your time in the circus with
  Molly what about have you ever
pooped your pants
 MT or empty
 Jester I feel your touch on this
conversation is this all accurate
 And the rest
 Well I will say I am a little concerned
about you know loose ends coming to bite you
and us in the butt However
 I believe in second starts and thats enough
for me
 May I make a check to see if I have ever
heard of the Moonweaver
 
  Molly
  I have a question
  Can you really read fortunes
  You have a feeling
 What about your tattoos though
 Thats a lot of ink man
 Hey does any of that symbology mean
anything to me
   Caleb I have a
question
  Do you shave your butt
 I can truthfully say
 No that was for me
 Now you know that neither Molly nor I shave
our butt
 And also theres not a lot of hair there
anyway so
 Perhaps we have learned all we need to learn
from this conversation Maybe it is time to turn in
We have some things to do tomorrow I am
satisfied Mollymauk Tealeaf For now
 The Gentleman described the research
facility to everybody right Before they split off
 The Gentleman
 Described the research facility the job to
everybody
 Right So we all heard that
 Yeah
 Oh no Im going to scuttle off and go over
to Pumats I have just a short little shopping
 Oh you do Okay So Im having bacon down
below so I will wait until I see you
 You need to let your soul glow
 Shuriken
 How much is a little bit
 Hey
 For throwing stars from Pumat Okay I will
definitely ask him if he has throwing stars
 Not interested but I will ask about the
items you are looking for
 Well not oneofakind
 No
 Oh man
 Laura is texting with a full case of FOMO
right now Ooh
 We miss you Laura Next week
 When you get home just the blinds are
open
 You did the artist formerly known as
Prince
 Just breathe it in
 I gather we all hear this conversation
yeah
 Ah regular Percival de Rolo over here
 Yasha and Caleb in Napoleon Dynamite
 Im sorry I have a simple request
 About  gold worth of ink for transcribing
arcane knowledge
 I have four gold to my name again
 Dont worry about it
 It is It is
 I dont think she would actually
 She might but it doesnt seem her bag
 Sounds like bullshit to me
 What about yourself
 Yeah but Ive seen you throw a dagger or
two in your time and you always have to walk out
to the tree and pull it out or walk out to the
gnoll and pull it out This way it would come
right back to you Think about it
 I understand If she changes her mind well
let you know
 How high are the ceilings in this store
 I low how your voice went  to
 The ceilings about Okay Got it
 She is quite pale Its hard to tell
 Attentions a bitch isnt it
 A thousand throwing stars
 I hand Yasha one of the ten gold that Beau
gave me This is Beaus money so I think shed
want you to purchase them
 Yeah but she doesnt like me very much
 Thats doubtful
 Why do I think its doubtful she will like
me She has threatened me constantly She is very
aggressive Shes very surly She doesnt smile a
lot unless there is a spell cast on her Ive only
seen her punch people in the face
 Give her time
 I give one gold to Yasha and I hold on to
the other nine
 Im going to give it back to her
 Too real for me too real
 We see guards asking around
 Okay I am just going to pull my cloak up
and put the hood up Thats all
 Well Horris is part of the mission
 We should go Lets make hay while the sun
shines
 Yes they were so heavy and I am so weak
that I gave them to Yasha to carry Heres your change
 Im just weird in general
 This is a Liam thing not a Caleb thing
 Im just going to say right now where we
are Frumpkin Im telling him to follow us all
about  to  feet back behind us
 
am wake up
 Happy Halloween
 I dont like the proximity here Frumpkins
gone out there Then once were in the
speakeasy sorry I just ate a cracker
 Frumpkins under a table
 As soon as the blindfold is on Im going to
pass my sight and hearing over to Frumpkin
 If it works
 Thanks blind woman
 Okay Yeah 
  Sorry
 This is okay
 How did my cat do
 Oh shit
 Total shit Five
 Yes
 Okay If I saw that I would snap my fingers
and make Frumpkin poof out
 Im going to bite my tongue and bring
Frumpkin back
 Its just a nervous tic Im a nervous
fellow Sorry
  Frumpkin back in
  feet behind
 Theres other people down here doing shit as
we walk by
  Jester has a question She would
like to know what it smells like in here
 I get in with Nott In the Yasha boat
 And I send away Frumpkin
 On our own
 We are all on our own here right
 Ja
 
 I let two of the globules hover around the
front of each boat One at the front and one at
the back of each boat
  Shes got a giant sword but who
cares Youve got to ask her
 Sure it counts It counts doubly as much
 No
  How big is the chamber we are
traveling in
  With my darkvision how high is
the ceiling in here
  I grab the edge of the boat and
  That was pretty good
 God damn hes going to end the game
 Damn it
 Four more hours Mimosas
 Come on
 Its like playing a video game for 
minutes Its so unsatisfying
 Its like a real game
 Yasha Caleb Nott
 Dinghy battle
 Yeah Yasha are you paddling
 Yeah so we would be at the front of the
boat going
 Terrible
 It is sad when ships sink
 I dont know

 
 That seems not like a good idea
 Nice Carrot Top nice
 Yasha can you use your oar to see how deep
we are Does it touch bottom
 Unfucked
 Excuse me you could be stealthing ahead at
this moment
 In the boat
 I had these miniatures I forget what
theyre called
 I dropped my Colville meteorite
 Oh I got a 
 Oh I got a one
 The  would have been nice though
 Thats so cool
 Und Ein
 Oh do I Oh sure two
 No no Plus one so now its two
 Ja Of course
 Im pretty sturdy though so I wouldnt
sweat it
 But do you see it
 We are level four Eight damage sick
 Mistress of the Hunt
 I went from being able to see almost nothing
to seeing nothing I heard Nott get scholpped in
and then I heard some cry So I raise up the glove
of blasting and Im going to fire at where I think
this thing is
 Yeah
 Three strikes at disadvantage
 Thats correct Okay good For the first is

 Yeah let me do them all 
 Und 
  Plus that is ten The total
is 
 Okay before it hits me Ill say I sit down
on the bench and just go 
 I am a monk its fine
 Yeah of course it hits
 Yeah thats wunderbar
 Does she get sneak attack since Im adjacent
to that
 One question is Frumpkin by the thing
Because Frumpkin is an ally
 I know that I have read that Frumpkin can
help me give me advantage
 Whatever you want
 I would say leave me in that motherfucker
 This is your jam
 Get it Altar
 In a split second before when I heard a
 Im feeling pretty good I feel
streamlined
 Yeah I clean up well
 Half of the skiff
 Still the only light in here are my four
globules correct
 Not so good
 Nine
 
 I scrabble back and squish in with Nott at
the front of the boat
 Bye
 I guess I am
 
 Halt Wait Stop
 Can you fight against the current for a
moment
 Okay its going to get dark in here for a
second all right But dont worry I drop the
globules and I cast Detect Magic
 It is only  feet
 Im focusing obviously on the rock slide
that you just described
 Beyond the rock slide
 Thats on one side of the passage that we
are in
 If I crane my neck in the other direction
is there anything on that side
 All right well in the darkness you hear

There is something of an arcane nature in the
middle of those rocks that were ahead of us What
do you want to do Do you want to go scrabbling in
the dirt or do you want to keep going forward It
could be something beneficial or it could be terrible
 Nobody can see anything right now
 Does anyone have a torch I would prefer to
keep this up for the time being
 Do I look like The Gentleman right now
 Okay
 Its not that weird
 Can I see what was giving me the arcane
signature
 Yeah What about you two beefcakes Can you
move these stones out of the way
 Question because the spell that I cast only
lasts ten minutes somewhere around the eight or
nine minute mark do I see You said it was on
the other side of the rock slide so are they
uncovering anything before the spell is gone
 So not a door but just a passageway
 The torch is still up
 Its possible that I will want to steal it
but can I make anything out Does it look like
anything that I have read about or encountered
before
 So its a glow stick
 But its in an iron cage
 Lets continue on
 Before we leave this little cage does it
look bolted into place
 Its small
 Maybe later Lets continue on Which way do
we want to go
 You have one setting Naughty
 Yeah I was going to say not the back but I
will let the bruiser walk behind me
 The shaft is
  No
 Has it been that long
 Well Schmidt cant see shit but Frumpkin
can my cat see in the dark I would know that I
dont know
 It makes sense for anyone who had gone into
their basement and seen the cat go 
 Okay well lets go by the rules then
 Well I have a range on that I dont like
that idea actually
 How about I send Frumpkin with you and
between Frumpkin and you well be in good shape
 Yeah
 Youre just peeking
 Who am I behind Mollymauk I place hands on
his shoulders and send Frumpkin down ten feet
ahead of Nott and Im seeing
 Yeah or listening and trying to listen and
see through Frumpkin
 So it gets too dark and hazy past that
altar
 Yasha can you hand the torch down and get
it to Nott so that she can go a little bit further
 Is it spent now
 Are you going to tell everybody about the
pressure plates
 Do we have anything heavy to put on them to
hold them down
 We dont know
 Has the party held up at this point
 While that happened I would like to
investigate the part of the room that I can see
Is there anything dangerous or hinky
 Yes thank you
 
 This is where Frumpkin is correct
 Through Frumpkins eyes The half of the
room or the portion of the room that Frumpkin can see
 Are we all going
 Im holding onto Mollymauk and just
following
 Its down low though
 Get it
 Arcana insight investigation
 I have that kids toy that makes these You
spin it and the little pen goes around and around
 Something was giving off an arcane aura
before we came in here but I cannot see it now
so if you indulge me and give me ten minutes I
will
 Yeah
 
 You can tell if you were to rotate it it
would line up Triangle to triangle that would
bring the star to that one there
 Theres a diamond right there
 Caleb is still going through the ritual
 Well I will remember this I have a perfect
memory I will remember this exactly
 She talks about them a lot
 Has ten minutes gone by yet
 Did Detect Magic reveal what was glowing in
here before
 Oh it was just the glow stick
 Shes too drunk
 Sorry 
 You want to deal with that right away
 Yeah here you go
 Big Lebowski
 Well heres what I think
 I can send these
little globules of light quite a ways and I can
also send Frumpkin quite a ways so why dont we
let Frumpkin have a look and we just hang back
 Lets say  feet in front of the group with
one of my Dancing Lights about ten feet behind
her him Him
 Its all right Jester drew it I remember
it were good
 Ill take second position
 Looking for dangerous shit
 For me through Frumpkin is terrible Seven
 Knowing distance space the direction of
north at all times with Frumpkin in there am I
able to tell how far back we are from this
chamber Were  feet back
 Would you say that Detect Magic is still
cooking at this point Are we still under the ten
minutes from when I cast in the other room
 Am I sensing anything
 Find one thing youre good at in life and do
it for the rest of your life

 Im going to scooch well no Im with
Beau so Im asking if I sense anything of arcane nature
 A retroactive question no never mind
 Anything arcane before it dips out
 No Im behind Beau
 Im dropping Frumpkin vision
 Youre also good
 You point that out as well
 Off of her first comment I would send one of
the globules floating up to the ceiling to better
illuminate what shes pointed out
 Was that  feet above us Is there any
space between the ceiling and the container
 No youre good
 Something metallic in the rubble Vase
above
 Just to clarify your description The
container is being held from above
 Chains coming down Or no two chains from
the ceiling
 Im going to scoot up behind Fjord and see
if I can detect any arcane anything before the
spell sniffs out
 What kind was it
 Yeah
 I catch Fjord by the arm Be careful
Whatever is under there is something of
protection Something to keep us out or to
protect something
 I think I would have noticed that the circus
bouncer looking in the urn did not get blown up
but also looked a little puzzled So Im going to
go over and take a look at the same thing
 Yasha is right next to it
 The dice are doubled Not your modifiers
but the dice
 Yeah
 I got another one for LA
 I was where Yasha was I went over to look
at her urn
 Frumpkin would have been just  feet into
the chamber
 Rolled one which makes me a two
 I love it
 They vanish Theyre gone Theyre fucking
ghosts
 You punched cotton candy
  Fuck you I wont do what you tell
me
 Go for that natural 
 Fucking muscle wizards
 Caleb does what that bearded dude in the GIF
does going seeing that happen and I cast
Scorching Ray myself and I will send one ball of
fire at the next pot
 No the other one besides that
 Yeah That is oh jeez Everything changed
for me So that is perception plus not
perception Intelligence modifier which is five
plus seven So that is an  to hit
 Okay thats d for a damage of seven
 So that did not get destroyed then it got
damaged
 That was just one so I continue to wrap my
hand around and a second one shoots out at the
one in the ceiling That is a natural 
 Yeah That is an eight
 The other one shoots up in the air and lands
two feet behind me just goes 
 No Im standing
 Oh shit thats hot
 Dont strain a hammy
 At this point we should be able to see the
things that the very perceptive people saw which
was two faces eyes with holes in them in the
middle
 In this room
 Should we do it in this room
 Mama put the coins in my eyes because I
sure do not believe what I am seeing
 Caleb doesnt say anything or move at all
but hes thoroughly impressed with Nott by the way
 I will send two of my globules down after
him
 How far down is that Does everybody see
 Yeah
 Caleb is travelling down the rope that Yasha
dropped
 I wouldve gotten down the rope at this
point and seeing Fjord examine that I cast
Detect Magic instantly
 Okay What kind
 Im allowed to know Its in the book
 Whats in the fucking potion Matt
 Does Detect Magic uncover anything else
besides what hes already looking through
 Oh an hour
 Fjord hold that up for me so I can tell you
what it is I will spend the next  minutes with
Fjord sitting in front of me and me looking at it
and doing the ritual
 You want to rest first or do you want me to
tell you what it is now
 Okay so  minutes that takes Identify
 Well I dont have it You have it
 Arcane recovery
 Yeah the eyes were for uncovering all that
death underneath our feet
 Fjord you can of course stick that thing
in the hole in that bottom room if you want but
if you like my man Schmidt could do it with
little risk to the rest of us If you like
 We should all stand back Better safe than
sorry
 Well look here now that were back peering
through the doorway at this We have this star on
that corner and if you would rotate we dont
know what were rotating is the thing
 Were saying thats the idea because theres
a diamond to a diamond and a star to a star and
a triangle of dots to that triangle
 Well I bumped up to 
 Edubation Its critical
 Evocation is destruction
 Im casting in an instant Unseen Servant
Schmidt is here with us
 Fjord hold out your magic whatsit there I
command Fjord to give that to Schmidt Schmidt
takes it
 The spell runs out

 I ask Schmidt to insert the spirally staff
into the Laura Bailey hole in the center of the dais
 It is true thats why were hanging back
behind the door Do we think we should go
clockwise or counterclockwise
 Schmidt please revolve that staff
counterclockwise please
 Well try it clockwise then Schmidt
 Well thats a lot of bollocks then
 Dance it out of there
 Not a gelatinous cube
 A gelatinous cube
 Oh shit
 We might need to do all three at the same
time
 Guys fucking focus
Focus
 No more dick jokes Focus on the cube
 This is dangerous
 
 You die
 Frumpkin or
 Frumpkin can be oh jeez right behind me is
fine
 Im going to use all my movement to move
back towards the doorway as best I can
 Ja As I am doing so I am pulling a small
clay cat paw out of my hand I mutter a few arcane
words and I cast Maximilians Earthen Grasp A wad
of soil forms out the ground and a cats paw rises
up and reaches out and swats at the gelatinous
cube
 Ja thats correct against my DC of 
 On a failed save the target takes d
bludgeoning damage so that is a seven and its
restrained for the spells duration So it attacks
at disadvantage and you attack at advantage
 There is a giant earthen cats claw holding
it on the corner
 Restrained its the restrained condition
 Yes it is
 I have a question is there any light in
here at all
 Okay so theres dim light then from the
torch
 Because my globules are gone
 Thats correct thank you Okay And then I
sit
 Yeah
 Say again
 Frumpkin can do whatever Frumpkin will run
towards Jester and get between wheres Nott
 Frumpkin will stand between Jester and the
cube
 Everybody has advantage on attack rolls
 Beauyasha Do it up
 Jello shots
 You did it at advantage
 Go for the 
 Yeah bones
 Dont step on my cat
 At disadvantage
 I want to roll a rogue right now
 That builds goblin
 Its restrained
 Lowlevel rogue Highlevel rogue eh but
lowlevel rogue is sick
 One time
 Just for attacks
  for me
 Gott verdammt Its out
 Does that mean its not restrained
 Whos it getting My cat You
motherfucker

 I mean Im assuming it takes like four
points of damage immediately my cat
 Three Its gone instantly
 I believe my Cats Paw is still in existence
and would like to try to do the same shit
 So    It can move as
well
 It is
 Yeah I can
 Looking it up
 Did it get five feet It was five feet in
front of it and it moved that way It wouldve
been right in front of it
 All right so DC 
 Its strength
 Aw it doesnt do it Great I will use the
rest of my movement to move another ten feet back
in the hallway Im in
 Shes out
 Was she absorbed
 Is she absorbed
 No probably youll die
 Yasha
 Ashley you just destroyed a classic
Dungeons  Dragons foe

  Put your tusk in there
Fjord

 Get my cat out of there
 From down the hallway you hear
 Now the
question is if we do the same thing again will
another one come out Or do we need to try to hit
all three at the same time Let me come in there
 Leave it nearby
 I can do both divination and evocation
 Can you do one of those things
 Well tell me what you are able to do
 Divination and evocation
 Yeah you can do evocation with this one
 But you have to get up there though You
have to touch it with that one
 So you handle evocation I can handle the
divination You handle necrotic
 It is worth a try Of course it is
 Im pretty good I have not let go all of my
preparation for the day
 Is everyone all right
 Jester how are you feeling
 No not Laura but you
 Jester How are you
feeling
 I reach into the satchel on the side
 I give her my potion of healing Regular
healing
 Well what are you complaining about then
 That is not the verbiage that I chose at
all

 Necro evo and divination all together
 Do you think it would hurt if we did it at
the same time
 Lets do it at the same time
 Identify which is divination
 Okay That was good We checked that box so
lets go back into the room
 Yeah okay
 Yeah thats good Its 
 The urns currently are totally empty
 I know I
 We maybe need to go upstairs and scoop some
of the dustbuster bullshit into these and bring
them down
 No Im saying we need to go collect some of
the ashes of the dead from upstairs
 Something is missing here
 Its possible that we need to burn something
afresh
 Yeah I can set things on fire as well Do
you want to do one
 Yeah its easier I cast Firebolt into one
of them
 Just to note Schmidt is still here with us
If we need anyone to hold anything thats dangerous
 I have transmutation
 I know enchantment and transmutation
 All right Well figure out
 I have transmutation and enchantment
 And what do you have Jester
 So youre enchantment That means I have
transmutation
 If another cube or something comes out
 Thats right Weve got these two bruisers
here Thats good I concur
 I of course in front of transmutation
 Youre doing what Im doing Maximilians
Earthen Grasp again with my cats paw
 Wait I sit down and I start doing the
ritual for Detect Magic again Ten minutes
 Five more minutes
 Caleb is super intense on his shit right
going to be safe
 Did we wait the short amount of time for
Detect Magic
 The willowisps are the dead They are
left from the dead
 Give me a second to blacklight the room
 Yeah Im waiting for the narrator to
 Yes good right So Im walking Is there
anyone between the bookshelf and me where I am
Is Fjord
 Whos the closest
 I walk up between the two of them and I
have a  foot radius on the spell so Im
basically doing this but Im very interested in
the bookshelf obviously Im looking everywhere
 Is there a type I will ask that every
time
 Friendship magic
 In the wall above the bookshelf
 Zero books
 Jesters holding it
 Hows the girth
 I obviously can do that and I have a little
bit of reserve left but we are still not topside
yet so we can either sit for ten minutes and I
can tell you exactly what it does or we wait
until later But Im not willing to do this
 It is ten minutes
 We can wait until later
 Does it have any paper
 A natural 
 No the first one was right
 Detect Magics still going by the way
 I know Common Oh god I dont know where to
look on DD Beyond
 Description character details I know
Sylvan Common and Celestial
 Then I will cast Comprehend Languages
 It doesnt Just one I cast Comprehend
Languages
 Dont write that down
 Because only I know it
 Right I tell nobody this
 I do read it out loud
 Jester while Molly is looking around hold
that for me Hold it still
 The sword and I will tell you what it is
but you have to hold it for a while Muscles
 Oh man
 Its okay I have one spell slot left its
fine
 All we have to say is we cleared it
 Yeah we need to do some discussion
 Thats nothing I could go for another two
hours at least
 Only cool things here Only cool things
 No its not

 Does it have any legs
 The  herbs and spices are
 Sechs
 
 Seeing how terrible everything is around me
I stick a quivering hand into my pocket and pull
out a little copper wire I learned how to do this
from Nott I cup it in my hands and I cast
Message to the thing Im going to text you what
Im only it can hear me and Im sending it to you
 While backing against the wall behind me
 I will send Frumpkin skittering down by
Yashas feet
 
 I didnt see any difference in it when I did
what I did ja
 How close could I get to it if I wanted to
walk straight at it
 Right up to it Could I get right behind
No Ill get right up to it ja
 Yeah okay Im going to cast Burning Hands
veered away so that it does not touch Yasha It
has to make a dexterity saving throw
 Ja
 Ja the creature is fine
 Its d halved
 Did it make it
 Oh no It did not make it It takes 
points
 Jester
 Natural 
 Can I see that last pot from where I am
 Okay that is a 
 Okay I will send a little Firebolt off and
try to strike it Its at disadvantage correct
Okay thats very bad Also very bad Thats a
ten
 Ja I will walk toward it to get closer
as much as I can
 I should have done that first ja
 Just a straight intelligence
 
 The book said the soul is bound to the flesh
be it in any form ice or ash but the ash in the
pots was the willowisp
 I am going to start moving towards the
middle towards Yasha I dont have any healers
kit or anything I dont know how to do anything
like that
 Im going to hold my attack a Fire Bolt
Can I do that I am a wizard for the first time
Can I hold a Fire Bolt
 Yeah when it appears
 We dont know that
 Resistant to fire Theres nothing else I
can do from where I am
 I dont want to burn the room around us
 If I set it on fire someone will still have
to pull it anyway Its not like its going to disintegrate
 Poofs out into a doughnut as a Fire Bolt
goes 

 I got it
 I send in two globules after her to see the
antiqued goblin
 It takes the edge off
 Hey Nott hows it going in there
 Its a five feet by five
 Youre in a tiny Why dont you bring that
thing out of there
 I feel like Notts head comes out of the
hole going  for fresh air
 I am stowing away the journal in there
 Like a kangaroo pouch
 I would prefer to inspect it Are we going
to stay here for a little while
 We could sit down on the floor together and
have a look
 Also what I would recommend if we feel
comfortable sitting down for a moment is to put
all of our findings in the middle of the room and
I can ritually see which of these things are
magic Most of these things we suspect but maybe
there are some other things Then I can tell what
exactly they are I need some time
 Also before Nott even got out Im stowing
the journal away for a closer read
 Oh Would you like to add it to the pile
 Im not really into smut Thats a bit of a
ruse
 I mean more than normal
 Within reason
 Well she was in a dark hole
 Hey you know this is going to take a
while so why dont we put it all down and I will
get to work okay
 How much you care to drink is on you
 Shes antiqued too Shes covered in ash
  Pah Pah
 I am well on my way I hope I have been
doing this for a while So step one is Detect
Magic on the pile to see whats what
 Does it also help that Im also within the
Oh no we took a short rest which is an hour
Okay Good The sword is the one thing
 Okay Can I pick up this new book and leaf
through it and try to see
 Would you be ever so kind I would be very
grateful
 I put my hand on top of yours Thank you
very much
 I begin the process of casting Identify on
the sword Oh and the mantle What about the
mantle Was that in the pile
 The original goth
 Okay this sword because I know youre all
dying to know is very old It is a greatsword
Would I know the name of it by casting this
 This sword is called The Magicians Judge
 Excuse me  The Magicians
Chudge
 Oh no Im absorbing and I will tell you in
a moment I need to make sense of it first
 Its a great sword and what this
  Its pretty great When
someone like Yasha hits a baddie with this you
can dispel any magical property that is present
Yeah Or without attacking you can hold the sword
up and do the same
 Big woman This has your name all over it I
think
 Yeah youll have to pick it up I cant
even lift this thing
 Yeah I assumed that immediately before the
thing attacked Probably Siffs legs are all over
you right now
 I dont know but it was worth it
 Caleb is chewing on his finger and looking
through the book
 Im thinking of all the good things that I
can do for our new collective
 It is the Random Old House First edition
Let me tell you this was a good find everyone
 Yeah What do they mean
 You are correct
 Terrible roleplay
 You know we could give him some of those
rings
 Ja definitely the art
 If we skimp hes going to think were
bigger assholes than we actually are
 You take my ring
 Give her a ring
 I gave it a cursory glance I skimmed it
 Thats a good point
 No we keep that sword This one with that
sword
 We can put it in the Haversack cant we
 I thought that thing was Mary Poppins
satchel It doesnt go all funny
 While we talk to The Gentleman while we
navigate that I could carry the thingy to make
room for it
 Yes and this sort of thing takes a lot of
work from very specialized people
 Clarification
 When Caleb did Detect Magic
did the circle in the center of the room glow at
all Or is it Its dead
 I will make a religion check
  for Caleb
 
 Why do you have such a queer look on your
face
 For the Crawling King you are talking
about
 Do you have a lot of knowledge for the gods
and religions of the world
 The aweinspiring one with the face is from
a dream you had
 I would like to do an insight check on Fjord
while he tells us that story Pretty good 
 Whack
 Well Nott and I could tell you
 You know I think we give him the things of
monetary value We are thinking longterm for this
group working together This book and that blade
are going to ensure a greater success and cohesion
in the future
 Then we are as one
 Can we try to do it but go with the hilt
downward See what happens
 What all is in that haversack that you
have
 Can we take out everything except for
 Caleb starts looking at the do
  Jester
 I know you are but I am cutting through the
noise Can we not take everything out of that bag
except for this new blade and the dodecahedron
Everything else comes out because the rest is
pretty utility is it not
 Yeah we can tie a rag around the end of the
blade to keep it from piercing anything
 I pull off the new cloak that I got a
handful of days ago We can wrap this around the
blade so it will not pierce
 Of course that will work
 The sledgehammer we leave Its a
sledgehammer
 Everything but the dodecahedron
 What if roll the sword up like a Fruit
Rollup
 Wear my cloak if you want to cover it
 I hang out at the back of the group for a
split second and hold out that wire that I used
to cast that cantrip and look at the room and I
look at the wire Then I follow everybody
 It was broken
 What we would have done is faceplanted on
the stone floor
 Can I say that as soon as I left this
chamber I tagged along behind my new monk best
friend and sent the globules in the air around us
even though she has the goggles and Im while
walking trying to read every page of that
journal And will continue to do so on the boats
 If we want to go back our two muscle
sisters could get us up this current for sure
 Yeah if we are doing that then I suggest
camping in this chamber before going forward
because we are all bloodied and battered you
know
 I would know what time of day it is
 I dont think we should go We either go
back the way we came or we camp before going forward
 Im going to stay behind I am out
 Terrible idea
 As they float away out of earshot I say to
Mighty Drei also sounds very cool
 No Frumpkin is scarfing around my neck
right now
 Find Clarota again
 Nipple rings in or out
 Insight check
  Time is a circle
  You are like my little doll
 Real difficult
 How long were they gone for
 I could probably read an average novel in
over an hour so has this journal been read
 Oh because its in a different language Oh
yeah
 No because I used my magic thingy to get a
slot back earlier in the day so no
 No I remember what I skimmed but I
dont
 Of what I skimmed I have to actually read
it to remember it and I did not read this entire book
 I dont touch the book to my head and then I
have it I have to eat the book
 Oh What I would have done if they left and
Im tapped Caleb would have used a ritual to cast
Comprehend Languages
 Yeah
 I am up to speed
 Do you want to read it
 You are a reader
 Fuck that kraken
 Its the same show
 That is not correct I was not hit in the
final fight
 I made out better than usual yes
 Okay I see where you are going
 Well I am not much of a believer in old
wives tales but I do like trial and error so if
you would like to do it again today
 As an experiment yes
 Do we have any more flowers
 You may
 How do I look
 Why dont you pull down your lower lip and
show us whats going on in there Fjord
 Did you grow up with people who did not have
tusks like you So you were different
 Insight check

 Just a ten not great
 How quickly do they come back
 This is many years later though I cant
imagine that any of us would even blink at tusks
 Yeah well you know for many of us our
early days are always with us I understand
 Cosigned
 So cloak on your back Sword on the cloak
 There is no We are going on We are going
right through their territory
 We are a very convincing group I think we
can talk our way through that
 You have your ways Well the morning is
getting on shall we
 Hans and Franz will you please muscle us up
this stream
 It feels so weird still with stealth
checks to only be able to add a one when I used
to add 
 Still feels weird
 Are we past those statues
 Slowly by
 Dont you have the heart of an ox
 We dont want to rock the boat here by all
means
 Do I see anything of note through Frumpkins
eyes as we walk
 Can I tell whats inside there
 Come on Frumpkin
 Doesnt matter
 Pretty bad Yeah both bad Real low Five
 No you dont want to get pantsed We did
not kill everything entirely There are some
critters on the roof of the river passage Nothing
major you just want to have your eyes on the
ceiling as you go through
 Yes To be honest it looks like it was
possibly looted some time long ago
 Whatever has inhabited the place in recent
years or in recent centuries has been removed
 Give him the book
 Yeah and we said that wed give him the
book so Im a little confused
 I said no at the same time Can she aid me
 I have very good charisma
 Im disappointed that we dont have real
bacon right now
 But less you need the protein
 Help me remember DM did we have a way to
get in contact with Dolan
 What mantacles
 This is the first I am hearing of the
manacles
 Maybe Pumat has a competitor in a town this
big
 Why dont we wait until were back at The
Leaky Tap before I look at these manacles you
have I would if possible like to swing past
Dolans house if thats okay
 Yeah and before he died he gave me
something that I think Dolan would want to have
Ulog before Ulog died
 This is surprising coming from me but I
agree with that sentiment You are covered in dead person
 You come with me because youve spoken to
him more than I have
 Only a moment of your time Im a little
embarrassed that I did not remember this the other
day but it was quite an evening that night
 When Ulog was in that house he found
something that I think you should have Shortly
before he expired he shoved it into my hand I
pull out those papers that he found about the
wife Its a little frayed he shoved it into my
hand We are lucky that it did not burn up but
take this please
 When it makes sense
 On his way
 Its entirely up to you now isnt it
 Tsch
 Broken clock twice a day Come on
 Yeah
 Marisha your theme with children
continues
 Passion Pit on the third of Fessuran
 I need money He said out of character
  I cast Hexblade
 What is the nature of the goods that you
have
 If I take a look at this skein can I take a
guess at what kind of illicit material Im looking at
 Yeah I have bad experience with fungus
 Medicine you say That is a 
 Yeah I dont have good association with
that You take that back
  How do you guys feel
 Hey Steve
 Are we saying this is night one of a couple
of days of piddling around
 Yeah
 Yeah I have shit to do as well party
animals
 I judge you heavily
 This is an entire three day weekend
 Pull it out
 No Not as fun
 Yeah shes got to walk
 Ja I have just enough ink and paper to
learn one spell in the big pile of spells that I
have right now so Im adding a low level one I
am penniless
 Ten games ago though
 Well a couple of things so I need more ink
and paper the kind to transcribe spells Before I
get to that and before they go off on their drug
party Yes before Jester goes
 It has only been a short amount of time that
I am thinking and I will be very careful with
the bag
 I was going to ask if I could hold the
Haversack and its contents for a day so that I
could better inspect and understand the thing
that
 I understand that I dont want to keep the
bag I want to have it before you go off to do I
dont know maybe youre going on a tour or
something
 Arent you about to go out with them You
told me you were leaving
 Well all right I would love to inspect our
special package and try to understand it better
if you want to be present for that
 I know you are going to drag me over the
coals for this request and that is fine I would
like the dungeon master to fast forward to the
part where you tell me if you will allow me to
inspect the contents of this Haversack
 Do you want to do this together
 On a different night maybe tomorrow night
because you just told me you were about to go out
with Molly
 Just inspect whats in the bag
 When she leaves I look to the mirror in my
room and Im like redfaced and I stare at
myself like dead expression for a good 
seconds

 Then I find Nott
 What are you back already No wait a
second Im talking to Nott in this part of the day
 Im really blushing How much disposable
income do you have at the moment
 Would you possibly loan me  gold
 I dont think I need that much
 I will give you the change Thank you
friend I will pay you back
 Thank you for teaching me how to and I
pull out the wire and back up  feet across the
reply to this message
 You know the thing about it for us is we
can go
 No we can go back and forth over and over
again just you and me Its endless
 For the other Dummkopfs its only they
can say one thing back but you and I we can keep going
 I know I understand but for demonstration
purposes
 Well thank you
 I will go to Mr Sols establishment

 Thats the sound the door makes when you
enter Pumats store
 To Pumats to buy ink and paper
 Thank you I buy  gold worth and I bring
Nott the  gold change
 I buy all that ink and paper and I spend the
rest of that day learning a small handful of new
spells which are in the Rolodex now and then the
next night
 Ja hallo
 Are you coming in Come in its open
 We are going to attempt to examine the
football as it were You can remain if you like
Are you curious yourself
 To the best ooh thats a good idea You
know to the best of my knowledge this is and
its limited this is a very powerful thing and
we are taking a risk
 but one that I think is worthwhile
 Are you still game
 All right We put the lead box on the floor
Lets leave it in the lead box but well lift the lid
 It is a calculated risk and we are going to
do this We are not going to take a lot of time
 Yes the safe word is Fjord so if shit goes
pearshaped and one of us says Fjord get Fjord
 Truthfully I have no idea
 You game
 Okay I am not coming on to you but will
you hold my hand while we do this that way if
we  I cannot even look at you I
cannot believe I am doing this experiment with
you Lets not cover the camera and lets examine
it together and if we go to the Nine Hells or
something at least well be there together in
theory
 We are going to look at this thing
 I dont know I am looking at it
  Yeah
  Do you know if its
achievable
 Theres nothing about it that is sensible or
familiar its totally alien to me
 Father and mother I hope I do not let you
down
 Its a big paper Let me read it
 Im wideeyed and not responding
 Im literally trying to read this and
failing because of my friends
 Thats your right I literally still dont
know what it does because everyone is talking constantly
 The dodecahedron of gray faintly glowing
crystal is heavier than it appears This is peer
pressure A set of handles are affixed to the
sides and it undulates to the touch Thats all
you get If a hand is placed on the artifact and
is concentrated on for one minute the bearer is
granted a Fragment of Possibility A Fragment
lasts for eight hours or until used A Fragment
cannot be granted again until the next dawn After
a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an
attack roll ability check or saving throw they
can expend their Fragment to roll an additional
d and choose which of the rolls is used for the
attack roll
 Ultimately after an attack roll is made
against a creature they can expend their Fragment
of Possibility to roll and additional d to see
if the attacker hits
 It is like one luck That lasts for eight
hours
 Am I able to tell if that is correct
 Any one of us one time It can only grant
this gift once a day to one of us
 I absentmindedly babble about what I think
this thing can do Its very incoherent
 What did I say What do you mean
 Okay
 What That is a very common sentiment Isnt
it
 Good to know
 That is true For both of you
 Well you are in possession of it for the
most part I said I wanted to have a look at it
 We can take turns with it We will decide
 By the way I shut the lead cover on the
box Lets put it back in
 Thats not how that works
 I am sure yeah Also with the knowledge
that I have and everything that just happened am
I aware the gray more that went inside me Would
I know does that limit this things ability to me
Or no
 Well in the description DM you said this
gray mote went into Caleb not into them Can
anyone use this thing
 Good All right Just checking
 Right Its like the little you know when
youre learning lyrics for karaoke and the little
thing bounces along
 Yeah I think this is a very potent thing
and we can use it to do a lot of good You know
not in the heat of the moment to try to hit a
gnoll in the face with something but when we are
really trying to figure something out or do the
unachievable
 Thats a good hypothetical
 That was a lot of advice I mean it is no
secret that I like these people so we are in good company
This is working out You are you know you are
capable oh dear Im going to go to bed now
 Definitely heard that Awkward and weird and
makes no sense but I will oh this is my room
You have to go to your room
 Goodnight
 This is the next morning
 Im going to no you should hold onto this
because youve got the Haversack
 Lederhosen
 Wow
 Can I ask a retroactive question Caleb and
maybe Beauregard read all of Siffs journal
 Was anything more to be gleaned from reading
the entire thing
 Okay and then the only other question I
have is I dont remember what time of day the
party ended the day If there was time I wouldve
used paper and scrolls to transcribe into my book
if there was time
 Okay good
 That sounded like pooing my pants
 Right around her titties The titty area
 Once you have a child I want you to turn on
a dime like a Tartuffe character and be matronly
and severe
 I wonder if the new proprietor knows there
is a dead person in the basement
 That is exactly what it is
 Well there were no horns and when youre a
skeleton your ears are rotted away so I do not know
 It couldve been
 Do you know that there is a dead person in
the basement here
 I dont think thats correct actually I
think its both things at the same time
 I am pretty sure thats incorrect
 You can eat anything if you are determined
enough
 I want to be at Ren Faire
 Im going to start walking towards the other
one the kings thing
 Dont worry If she falls they kill her
 Chaching
 Come on one
Yes Yes Yes
 Yes Yes
 Thats all right You got them out of the
way When we fight a basilisk later all those
ones are gone
 Yeah what sort of game is it that you are
running
 Well I just so happen to have three silver
on me It takes one silver to play
 At least Well I am feeling lucky today and
always Here it is
 Does my Keen Mind help me at all in this
situation
 Natural 

 I will go with the center one
 I think it is this one right here
 I will go with the middle one I think its
probably the correct place
 Two silver Well you know I just wanted to
play the game Im not trying to make any money
Did you want to do anything here
 I give her my two silver Do me proud
 I am going to back up like five or six steps
and also do the same thing Nott did
 I got a total of 
 Do I get a chance to whisper to her what I
saw Because I want to do the same thing
 Yeah okay
Oh thats not so good That is a six
 Oh I am a funny guy
 Yeah but you know also the other day you
gave me  gold so its not really a problem
 I give her the stinkeye as we walk away
 I intensify the stinkeye
 Did you have a different kind of dream
 Beat again
 It was called Kings Crown
 Thats what I said
 She was very quick yeah
 Thatll do pig
 About seven feet away out of habit Caleb
 I havent had one of those in such a long
time
 While I start to enjoy my apple I would
like to look around and see if there are any book
stalls or book barrels
 Perception you said
 
 Okay while I was looking round is there
anything besides games and food
 Huge long shot probably a no but do I also
see anything about the Cobalt Soul here
 Well you know I tried to do a little stuff
on the sly a little while ago and didnt work out so well
 Well if you can keep eyes off of me for a
moment I can do that if you like
 Im trailing about  feet behind Molly
 Did you want to play this game
 No she is an excellent shot Shes
trained
 Sure How much to play your game
 My daughters crossbow you want
 Well you know Ill tell you something If
you want to have a laugh lets have me do some
physical sports so that should be pretty good
 Just a question for you Should I hit the
one in the back which is highly likely could we
have the dolls weight in rats instead
 Is this an attack roll
 Let me show my daughter how it is done
 Watch my form and technique I pick up the
bow and I take the stick thing I pull it back like this
 Yeah
 
 The farthest one obviously
 Oh
 Aww no not at all That is a three
 Hmm The fretching on that one was
probably not very good Let me try again
 Listen I have read a lot of books I know
it is fretching
 Nope Dang it The second rolls are always
really good That is an eight
 This is not wellcrafted I grab my wire
that I use for the message spell and I put my
hair into a little ponytail
  Okay Oh no Ten
 Full disclosure
 I have no athletic ability
That went as well as I expected it to
 I slap down the silver for it
 Yeah It was two right
 I put down two silver
 Now go home and get your fucking shinebox
 It really depends on what you have at your
disposal Yeah
 A little granny painting furiously
 This is like the King of Kong
 Thats the wang
 Those knuckle hairs are like fly legs
 Oh
 Caleb is going to sneak off while everybody
is involved with this
 Fist of the North Star
 Put him in the body bag
 Do that speak at the same time hear ye
hear ye
 I am on an errand
 Oh well Ill wait until they wind down
perhaps
 It could be a while Well back at the
Righteous Brand when I snuck out would it be
possible for me to find an alleyway or somewhere
secluded so I can cast Disguise Self on myself
Around myself not as myself
 Yeah okay Then I would like to look
exactly like I do however the clothing that Im
wearing is a shade of blue that is similar but
not identical to the robes that I have seen
people from the library of the Cobalt Soul A
similar blue and very large coke bottle glasses
My eyes go all fisheyed Everything else is the
same
 I would like to find one of those people who
was dressed like they came from that library that
I saw that day with Beauregard
 Its investigation you said
 Its a 
 I would like to approach them
 Yeah Excuse me Im sorry May I trouble
you for a moment I know this is untoward in the
middle of a festival
 Oh yeah Again I am very sorry I am a
traveling writer I am writing a history of the
great cities of the Empire and I have heard
wonderful things about the library that is under
your stead and I dont know I have viewed it
from the outside it is a beautiful structure but
I dont know what it entails to visit it I was
wondering do you allow outsiders I dont know if
it costs a fee or if you need some sort of letter
of recommendation but I am very eager to learn
about the library itself and the city and
everything that I can learn about it so I can
write more extensive it would just mean so much
to me
 Its all true though
  It is a 
 The entire library
 Oh of course
 It is far simpler than I had imagined
 Thank you so much Forgive me this is
forward What is your name
 It is a pleasure This is a different
subject almost entirely but I was wondering I
mean to make a stop at all the great libraries of
this city I was wondering is it a similar
situation at the Hall of Erudition
 What was the headmasters name
 Oremid Hass
 Oremid Haas is running the Halls of
Erudition
 Okay Apropos of nothing I have heard about
this tower attack Thats terrible
 Im amazed it did not fall
 Do they accept oh no they dont accept
visitors there
 Well I have taken up enough of your time
 Id like to say thank you Have a wonderful
festival
 I turn a corner and fucking book it
 What do you mean
 I was sightseeing
 Where are we right now
 Are they all around us or are we off to the
side
 Okay so I lean down to tie my shoe and let
the cloak fall around me and I get down between
Yasha and Fjord and when I come up everything is
back to normal
 It gives me a headache so I took them off
 Exactly what I was saying I was
sightseeing I was asking about their libraries of
the city
 Not so many
 What
 
 Im also curious Is it a bareknuckles
thing or is noholdsbarred do whatever you want
 DM could you say that crazyass name
again
 Caleb Beauregard can you front me 
gold
 Theres four more for you
 Yeah and Beauregard is the family name
 Kitty
 Where did my cat go
 The last I see of Frumpkin is where
 Okay I count to six and then I snap my
fingers and pull him off of this plane
 I have a leather thong or a string wrapped a
couple of times Im going to ignore Laura
Bailey wrapped around my thigh and I will grip
it in my hand and say a few arcane words and cast
Mage Armor and out from the leather strap around
my leg a light shimmer goes up over the entire
body for a split second and is gone
 You have not seen me with my clothes off
yet
 Secret warp zone to level eight miss that
 Do I notice anything
 It occurs to me that starting tomorrow it
would be more important than ever that we stick
together
 All of us
 What
 Yeah I talked to some people from there
yeah
 Actually it was not the exact same color
It was a similar color but not the same color
 Beauregard is there something that you are
after here
 Nothing pertaining to what we have just
learned If that is what you are looking for no
I want to enter that library although tomorrow
anything goes I dont know
 How will you get me into the library
 Would I instantly recognize that as the same
as the people I spoke to
 I mean theres probably enough to go on
here Shes also dressed in blue Shes basically going
 Well if were not all dead in  hours
maybe we can talk about that again
 I drop a little bit of spell components
through the box
 Caleb is popping his hood up over his head
and face
 Ten
 
 Would I have been able to cast a spell as we
are pushed forward into all this mess
 Blur
 Matt I take that back Im not going to
cast Blur Sorry my apologies
 As close to the center as is possible
 Liam knows what that is Grody to the max
 
 What if they are like police batons
 I pull out a handful of iron powder and I
throw it into the air so its a big cloud and my
two hands go  and Yasha grows to
twice her normal size
 Then I will use my movement to get over to
the corner near Fjord If I could get around it I
would but Im sure I dont have enough movement
 Yeah so youre at advantage because of your
size and all of your attacks have an additional
d
 Shes  feet tall
 No youre six  feet tall
 ish feet tall Doubles it Your weight is
eight times its normal weight
 Who do you choose
 And your d for being gigantic
 Matt is that ring for what concentration
 All of the male players are  feet back
and all the women are right in there
 I am very aware of how many people are in
this arena especially highpowered ones as I
wrap one hand around my forearm and I cast
Scorching Ray even though I feel nauseous and off
they go
  ten 
  points of fire damage
 Ill take a step five feet that way and as I
do so I look over at Fjord and just and thats
the end of my turn
 A minute so probably the time it takes her
to cast that spell and you to run into that hole
Yasha that should probably end right about magic
fizzles
 Natural one
 Hundred dollars
 I rolled a natural one so
 Four
 You can certainly try
 I pull out a cats paw and say
 
Bad dog Maximilians Grasping Cats Claw comes
out by that one there It has to make a strength
saving throw
 Ja but it has to save
 
 Und I will move that ways to make a
triangle with the two dogs and myself to get as
far away as I can get
 Everyone gets advantage on it and its at
disadvantage to hit us
 Oh also sorry It takes bludgeoning damage
from the attack that I gave it
 Six
 Super buff and not just in the game
 
 Oh strength
 Thats its action correct to break free
 It felt its gooch almost rip out

 Ah couldnt see her behind the wall
 Is this the same sword weve always seen I
dont remember the word Liam doesnt remember
the word Wastehunter
 Ja just deadpan I do this around my hand
and I cast three Scorching Rays out of it at this
thing The first does not hit at all it was a two
  Four five 
Total of nine fire damage
 I call out as I walk backwards slowly

Fjord you got this Good I walk deadpan
sideways behind that piece of stone

 I think thats it
 Oh get it Finish him
 Thats good
 Im pretty shit
 I could get knocked out by a crownsguard
right now
 I am snapping my fingers and bringing
Frumpkin scarflike around my neck under my hood
Just to have him with me
 I will stay with Fjord
 All right this is how much time we have to
plan in the moment as this is happening
 This is about how well we do
 It is hard to walk on two legs maybe four
is better
 Yep
 Just wear him down
 
 I see this giant behemoth and I start
backing up to go west around the stone under my
Nein the Mighty Nein And fire off a Fire Bolt as
I sneak behind it
 No that is no good That is a 
 That is a one
 Ja I am leaning crouching against that
stone hands on the wall just listening and
working on keeping my gourd from rising
 Im behind the stone pressed to the back of
it though presently correct
 It is at  at the moment
 Well bring it on here we go
 What did it do it did to  I can do a
reaction cant I
 I cast Shield
 What did he roll
 Still hits Because that only gets me up to

 Okay good
 That really hurt Charlie
 I was considering going out there but Im
not going to do it Im going to bend around the
side and fire off another Fire Bolt at it At
Charlie That is a  to hit
 Yeah Im going to use my movement to back
up behind that column
 Ja
 Ja
  Two wild and crazy
clerics
 Whats your max
 Its a quick thing
 Tal
 Full HP
 Yeah youll get advantage
 You have to intimidate his dick
 This is a long shot but I have no way of
damaging him Im going to pull out some sand out
of my pocket and mutter a few arcane words and trail
it in front of me and cast Sleep back behind him
here so it does not touch Beauregard
 Ja
 Ja I know This is probably not going to
work but I cant hurt him Fuck Good better

 Were going round by round
 Dont touch the giant
 Yeah I will start moving towards Molly and
Yasha as far as I can get I call out medium
wasnt even supposed to work
 Yeah dont touch him
 Until we touch it so we need to get in a
Goodfellas circle around it to decide whos going
to beat the shit out of him and dont touch it
before that moment
 Caleb says Yeah
 Im going to move back by where Fjord is
right now behind that column
 Stand me by Fjord to the north
 Yeah
 Ill form the head
 Whoever hits big hit first
 Whoever can do the most damage with one
attack should go first
 You gave him the die
 I pull my hood further down over my face
 What happens now Do we just go home after
this or is there some sort of soire afterwards
 Who is invited to the party
 Are they totally visible to us What are
their physical appearance
 The people that are with Dolan what do they
look like
 Caleb
 They were the two that were just pointed out
to all of us
 Through the gates
 I think for a day or two everyone here is
going to be very preoccupied in the city If there
is anything you are thinking of doing it would be
a good time to do it
 What I am suggesting is a compromise Not
leaving immediately but soon
 DM can you remind me what time of day it
is
 On past days has Pumats place been open
this late
 I am already hanging out by the door to this
place I left  seconds ago
 Is it really crowded in here Are there a
lot of people
 I am going to send Frumpkin dancing around
peoples feet to follow Yasha and Beau and take a
seat in a chair on the side of the room as close
to the door as possible
 Hass or Ikithon
 Im taking all this in first person
 Thats all I can take I get out of it
 I lean forward and look at the ground
 Maybe where you are from and how short a
time you have been here
 Yes you did
 Yeah but you also dropped a horse apple in
front of them as well
 She mentioned a little insight on the
pending war when no one knows about the pending war
 During this whole talking I look in and see
where my cat is
 Okay I tell him to wait there for me
 How quickly are you thinking
 How about  hours from now
 Yeah One more day Just to get supplies and
get ready for the road again
 I think what my friend is talking about is
can you recommend any good ways to get into
trouble
 What you will
 Fjords work
 Are we talking about rolling at the Pillow
Trove this evening Is that what I am picking up on
 Seven eight nine
 Wait were getting turnt up before we go to
Pumats
 Do you think Pumat is going to be open at two
in the morning
 We dont
 Yes
 Very obviously holding and petting my cat
and looking at all three of them as we walk by
 Guten abend
 Abend
 Yeah thats
 Excuse me apologies I pull Beau backward
by the arm And no Long enough until we fall
back a bit and wait to see that the group is not
paying attention
 Can you get me into that library tomorrow
 Okay
 Okay but the library is a thing that we can
do before we leave this city
 I am just hoping to look at books Is that
all right
 Good Great
 No I mean spells you can find you know
digging in  year old laboratories I want to
learn I want what is not readily available to
all
 I dont know if that is something that I
would be allowed to look at What kind of
clearance do you have
 History
 Okay this is good
 Oh thats two times Ive tried to bail out
of this conversation
 Uh Well
 Are you going to set the books on fire
 Im going to read them
 Is there anyone around
 But the handle gets I do the same thing
with this cup I grab it by this the whole time
 How do you do it Sam
 Can I ask an outofcharacter question As a
citizen of the Empire how much does Caleb already
know about the Cobalt folk
 Right youre a librarian
 Their political affiliation
 What
 Oh thats fine
 I leave the room and actually run downstairs
and ask the front desk if they have another room
 How much is that
 Excellent Ja Here you go
 I rolled a one Are we done taking
donations
 You know for  Thats all done now
right
 So now theyre just straightup bad
 About when this is happening I pull the
wire out of my coat and hold it into my palmed
hands and Message to Nott Nott will you find an
excuse to bring Beauregard and yourself to my room
you saw me go into
 If I eventually catch it I give Nott the
room number
 Come in
 Potentially You know were leaving soon
and Beauregard has an in at one of the bigger
libraries in the city and I want to go there
before we leave
 Yes but Beauregard has given me a
condition She had some questions for me and I
would like to answer them but I dont feel right
telling her and not telling you so I would love
for you to stay here for a few minutes
 Beauregard may I ask you a question to
start
 How do you feel about the Empire
 Are you in favor of how things are going
here
 Are you comfortable with business as usual
 Do you approve of how the Empire is going
 Is she lying to me about being not
invested
 Do I have to shout Insight check or
 Oh Not super invested about how the empire
is going
 I would like to get if my reading on if that
is genuine or not Yeah
 Okay so Liam asking a question and this
is your choice Its just an idea that popped in
my head Could I request that everybody but Sam
and Marisha leave the table
 Yeah
 Well I really want to go to the library
tomorrow
 This may be a very stupid decision of mine
 Would you be willing to leave with me
tomorrow if I asked you to
 Just the two of us
 I am going to tell you the story of how I
murdered my mother and father
 When I was younger I grew up in a small
township outside of Rexxentrum called Blumenthal
My mothers name was Una My fathers name was
Leofric Everyone was very excited about me when I
was young I was bright and confident People used
to say that I glided through life and everything
just worked for me As I got older it became
clear that I had a knack for the arcane Everyone
talked about this Soltryce Academy maybe I would
go there someday The way they do things at that
Academy they dont take all comers they look for
the diamond in the rough and every couple of years
they find one But when I was a young man
adolescent really they found three of us
Another boy and a girl and
 Ja from Blumenthal And we were
accepted
 I was young
 Yeah Anyway we went there I studied for a
year I worked so hard It came easier to me than
the other two but they were also very
accomplished There were other students from other
parts of the Empire there and a little over a
year of learning all they had to impart I met a
man named Trent Ikithon He became our teacher
 Earlier when earlier tonight Earlier a
week ago What do you mean
 After a year of studying in the main school
Trent handpicked all three of us again and we
left the school proper and went with him to a home
out in the countryside where he trained us It was
a good time We believed in the Empire we were
going to keep it strong He was cruel He hurt us
a lot Made us go through extreme circumstances
but we got strong I also fell in love but thats
another story
 Yeah We rose through the ranks and it was
the Empire over all and eventually he wanted to
test our allegiance so strangers were brought
in traitors Disgusting people traitors to
this empire and we killed them
 Mmhmm
 We wanted to be
 Yeah A few months of studying of a little
bit of torture a little bit of murdering
dissidents and traitors and deviants
 No We were ready to graduate and the last
test of our allegiance was Im getting ahead of
myself I went on a trip home and visited my
parents and when I was there in the middle of the
night I awoke and overhead them talking and went
to the stair and listened to them talk about
revolution and tearing the Empire down and I felt
disgraced and shame for my family My mother and
my father who were so wonderful to me when I was
a child and were so happy for me to go to the
Academy and believe in the Empire so much I
went back to the school and when the three of us
were summoned and told what was expected of us I
knew what had to be done We went to this other
boys home first Eodwulf and we stood by as he
killed his parents We went to Astrids house and
had dinner with them and she poisoned them Then
we went to my home and we grabbed a horse cart
and in the middle of the night placed it against
the door to the home and I set it on fire
 Well yeah but it didnt exactly go
according to that plan because as soon as I heard
my mother and father screaming inside I was so
sure I was so sure until I wasnt and I broke a bit
 No I went to an asylum for a number of
years I broke I dont remember so well what
happened to me there It was quite a number of
years Years later a woman was there and she
another patient put hands on me and she took the
clouds away She took it all away and not just my
madness but the fake memories that Ikithon put in
my head of my parents
 Wanting to betr yes
 Yes but it doesnt matter because I still
wanted to do it when I did it
 So what
 So what
 Doesnt matter I should have Im a
disgusting person It doesnt matter Anyway all
that gone just like that I ran Not right away
I pretended like nothing had changed for several
weeks She was stark raving mad  minutes later
herself the woman who helped me I killed one of
Trents people there and took this I pull out
the necklace This has been keeping me hidden for
years For five years
 They can find who they want but not with
this They cannot find me I would really like to
get into that library because I would
 Hmm No I like you all
 Well that all depends on you Beauregard
 If you can keep a secret
 Anyway
 Which is
 Well thats precisely why I want into this
library
 Among other things
 Anybody can make lights Anybody could send
a message through a wire I want to bend reality
to my will
 Yeah well I told you why I am afraid of
fire So you are going to bring me to that
library
 Both of those are appealing to me
 Okay good I think Nott and I are going to
retire now Maybe you can go get that food for the
others
 Yeah
 But you dont have to leave the table
 Im not asking you to leave the table
 
 Goodnight Beauregard
 
 Are you and I good
 I have an idea that can make that happen
 Yes It will take a lot of hard work
 And a lot of books
 I pull out the silver thread and I start
putting it around the room and go over some
notes I have some ideas already some ideas I
had and I will stay up another hour or two before
going to bed
 Were still presleepy time
 No I want to go to the bathroom
 Thanks Dad
 Yeah
 We have to take a trip to Pumats for
supplies and then
 Pumat library
 Well do library first Then well pull
Matt
  Hey you got your chocolate in
my peanut butter
 Its a party girl
 Did we hear that though
 That would be helpful
 Im going to do the same thing that I did
the other day I am going to cast Disguise Self
and make the gigantic glasses and change my cloak
to a similar shade of blue
 They would let you bring a mother and her
baby into the library
 Normally when we do Mothers Love Nott
stabs people
 Hey this citys under lockdown can we go
into the library
 Me I am interested in the history of the
greatest arcanists of all time
 Ja Caleb Widogast
 I am looking for histories accounts of
people who pushed the boundaries of what can be
done over the ages The firsts I am interested in
more than what is typical at least as much as can
be known Do you follow me
 Ja that is true I am a magic fan
 What about the unexplained
 Questions There is a certain amount of
knowledge in the schools of this empire and then
there are questions Theorizing philosophy of the
arcane
 Excellent I shall go there next
 Yes
 I start reading
 I will start with the first the oldest
 This one I am absorbing it I will read it
cover to cover
 Im a speed reader and an average novel
takes an hour to an hour and a half for a speed
reader to read
 Im holding three tomes correct
 If I take a moment to skim ten minutes
through each one and get the barest idea of what
I would find inside each
 No Im trying to figure out if I were to
look at a couple of pages at once from three
different books
 I want the furthest extent of transmutation
and changing reality
 This was in one of these tomes
 Then I will focus on that because Im
interested in that
 You know my main interests Do I find
anything of that in here
 I spend all my time with that book
 Can you give me two more hours
 What about  more minutes
 I skim the book on the Cerberus Assembly
 I could say Im muttering it under my
breath
 Similar name
 Okay I will say that I got my fill I can
feel this ones radiating
 I want to stay for  more hours but Im
ready to go I am good I am done Thank you
 Thank you
 Caleb looks at the thousands of books that
he did not read and leaves
 Lets go find the others
 Do you have any of that paper that I have
been purchasing so much of
 Could I purchase say  gold worth of it
 Beauregard does not either
 I defer to the group I think we work well
together and whatever you thinks best
 What about your interests in the Hall of
Erudition here and the Academy
 Yeah
 You know coasting is not a bad idea either
There is not as massive a gain but there is not
as high a risk for whatever this  gold 
target is
 Play it safe
 Ointments
 Which spelling are you using for that word
AWK OCK
 You just made it three times as complicated
in seven seconds
 I rolled a four
 Four plus Ive a constitution modifier
 Whats everybodys hit points at what are
the new totals
 The best thing ever
 Where were leaving off are we going to
come back Because its the end of the day are we
going to come back at the end of the day or are we
going to come back next morning
 Theyre engrossed in leveling up This is
the joy of Dungeons  Dragons
 Weve got to
 Round one
 I cast Haste on Beauregard
 Its licorice I just need licorice
 I didnt try to hide it
 Caleb is stress chewing on the licorice root
that he used to cast the spell
 An extra attack action
 Beat that practice dummy
 Is what Jester thought
 Oh no Im just being my same awkward self
Its fine
 Definitely the mushrooms
 I send Frumpkin over to start lapping the
blood off of Jesters face
 Ja who are these friends of yours up
north
 Complications predicament do you have any
more specifics than that perhaps
 No we are interested in more of a buffet
here today
 As a sidebar should we be worried about our
friend that we sent north to that area
 Return of the Vex
 Does that contraband include highquality
paper and ink
 Highquality paper and ink
 Just Pacman table
 Are you
 All of us
 And hey DM knowing the Empire how direct
a route is it from Fabron Keyess area Berleben to
Shadycreek Run
 We have to go around some mountains right
 Yeah
 
 Berleben Hupperdook is over here
 Were down there
 And Shadycreek Run was what area again did
you say
 Quannah Breach There it is Were very
close to Berleben and then it seems like quite a
 Stray yeah a trek to
 Xhorhas is over there
 If there is a chance to look in on Horris
if it is easy if it doesnt put us out you know
If its put right in front of us
 I am over Zadash
 Well quite frankly I am a little more
comfortable in Quannah Breach anyway
 Yeah
 Yeah
 For a round its gone
 Its just a pain in the ass in combat not
in out of combat
 No
 Yeah I will as well
 Well well hope we can do both Can we do
both
 When you say underground are you speaking
metaphorically or do you literally have a way
underground to get there
 The river goes that far
 Yeah we took that for an hour not 
miles
 What would we have to be wary of in the
river
 Paper and ink
 Ive used it
 Sure
 Caleb hangs back all by himself and says

 Paper and ink
 Ja danke Okay
 I am going to run over to Pumats to buy
some paper and ink
 Im gone
 Ja This is a quick stop I dont want to
take up too much of your time and we dont have
much We have a busy day planned I was wondering
if you had perhaps maybe  golds worth more
of that good paper and ink that you have supplied
me with already
 Oh ja I am sorry Also I am in need of
maybe  golds worth of fine incense if you
have that as well
 Is there anything that you wanted to
purchase while we are here
 Holy shit Pumats
 You dont want to know how much I have
 We are very appreciative and I dont know if
you have already but you should look into some
sort of membership card or frequent customer
points
 Thousand golds worth of paper and the th
ream is free Well go now
 You know that little boost you had back
there in your fist fight with the blue one Youre welcome
 I cast That was arc That was a spell
 You scratch my back I will scratch yours
 The others are on a mission lets go
 Loaf How about Loaf
 I want to be on the cart
 Yasha will you hold this for me I put
Frumpkin on her shoulder and start transcribing
 It is a real cat
 Frumpkin can be here or Frumpkin can be
there and right now he is here
 He would like you to touch him yeah But
respectfully
 No I think its pretty instantaneous and
honestly I am so glad to have him but I think
that it is probably nicer on the other side Does
your mother ever read stories about the Feywild
and sprites and blumpkins Thats not the word
 Of the Feywild
 Its another plane of existence that is a
mirror slightly off of our own With us but apart
from us at all times
 That means he likes you
 I tell Frumpkin to nestle in and he starts
doing that thing where they claw their way in when
theyre getting cozy It hurts but its also
lovable at the same time
 Then I stop talking to everybody and I start
transcribing things
 Sometimes you do make them bulletproof and
we get mad But most of the time we can crack the code
 Were going north
 I donate the paper that The Gentleman gave
me
 Im taking this silver thread and making a
foot cube around the cart
 Perception check at disadvantage
 Gods really cool right Right right
 Wild and crazy guys
 That was the best sleep I have had in a long
time
 My father used to tell me that they would
steal children Ja
 Excuse me Nott are you taking the piss
right now
 With all due respect she is smarter than
that
 Frumpkin goes back to the Feywild
 Why dont we send my cat
 If its of interest we can turn around
 A mile away
 Oh
  Yeah
 All right For you Fjord I will make
Frumpkin a bird
 You are more sensitive than I would have
imagined
 Youre so tough but everybody here likes
you
 I was just about to make a really cool owl
Are we really Okay
 Wait shes going to the shack
 I put Frumpkin back on her shoulder
 Im going to start looking through Frumpkin
in an attempt to let Yasha know I am with her I
make Frumpkin do this to her forehead 
with his paw
 Oh thats a good question I know that we
were looseygoosey with familiar things I know
that weve said that I can see this far away but
I probably cannot make him do that this far away
  feet I take it back
 I would say Caleb has been narrating this to
everybody back
 This is our kingdom
 Small Shit Keep
 Silver thread
 I found poison oak you guys
 I got it
 I am
 I have 
 With advantage or straight
 Straight roll
 I will still do it
 Oh I think its  feet I bet thats
wrong It is  feet
 Ok Ill roll the twins Hey really good
Thats a 
 Nott theres something
 Something
 Whack
 I just smack Beau and then
 I cast Mage Armor
 The second does not hit but the first one
obviously does
 Not great Ten
 Shit I wanted to talk to Nott
 Matts wood
 Theres big people Theres little people
 
  does not hit
 Does not hit
 
 Theres an arrow sticking out of my ribs
 Im going to push through the pain in my
veins and reach into my satchel and smear molasses
on my hand Im going to cast Slow on this batch
here They have to make a wisdom save against my DC
  is the DC
 Speed is halved Takes negative two to AC and
dexterity saving throws Cant use reactions On
its turn it can use either an action or a bonus
action not both
 Thats okay Im going to use my movement to
get closer into the fire Maybe over towards Molly
and Yasha
 Yeah
 Slow
 Is that half of his movement
 Yeah okay
 Ill take it because Shield wont match the
difference
 No
 I did well Concentration is Ive never
done this before
 That is a 
 Oh Gottsverdammt
 Ten
 Im looking through my eyelashes
 Wheres my Percy die
 Deception you say It is an 
 Ja
 But really Im up to full
 Yeah because I have no hit points
 Shes redirtying me for me
 This is what Dungeons  Dragons is all
about
 What happened to me I havent gone in a
while
 Im poisoned so any attack rolls are at
disadvantage correct
 Im going to struggle to my feet and Im
going to cast Sleep over and away in that
direction so it falls way back behind the ogre
and these two wolves The goal is to get the ogre
and two wolves just on the edges of it so it
doesnt hit any of my friends Im aiming far
behind them to get them on the perimeter
 The wolves are the primary goal stopping
short of Jester They are the wall the outer edge
 Bad roll  hit points total
 I got to standing which would take half my
movement so Im going to use my last  feet to
get exactly opposite to the other side of the wall
by sliding around it And killing Jester
 Haha funny joke
 Yeah okay Im going to start muttering
under my breath and stretch out two hands and send
way and two at this one and two at the one that
ran that way
 Im casting it at level two
 Okay so the one that was near Nott is three
and seven for that one
 Verdammt Two three and seven for that
one as well
 I will just stay put
 It wouldve been about  feet away from you
if he used his action to dash
 I would have said if wed gotten around to it
that if I could go another  feet in this
direction if I could still see the last goblin
that went this way I would fire off more magic
missiles to finish it But thats only if I can
see it
 Terrible Six
 Magic Missile
 No Lets do level three
 Thats 
 Yeah Who wants to go with me to go get our
stuff
 Caleb in Celestial says
 No but really
are you an angel
 Its a secret nerdy language you wouldnt
understand
 Continuing in Celestial
 Just Laura Well I figure youre going to
have to explain this a bit either now or later
Do you want to do it now or later
 Theres nothing around right Perception
check
 Just a ten Besides you
 In Celestial
 The blue one is getting pouty
we better switch back to Common
 Wellread
 Was there anyone you were close to
 What if we went with you
 Did you see what Yasha just did though
 I think it is a good idea to go there when
we are finished
 I do not care I know who you are now If
you dont want to go back there we dont have to
go back there But if you actually do dont be
afraid to ask I will go with you
 You told me it was cherry wine
 Were arguing about whos going to take
the first watch
 We could finish the watch that we didnt
really finish
 Why dont you take the next one
 Can I say something short to Nott before we
switch to the last
 Sitting in the rain You know I never
talked about my past for obvious reasons and I
didnt want questions pointed back at me Still no
pressure on you but if you ever want to talk more
about it the door is always open for you Nott
When you are ready
 Who am I to judge
 I fall asleep in the mud and rain
 More ogres and goblins
 Five more hours
 Can you get it empty or close to empty if
you try
 I am not suggesting you try
 I grab and shake it with my thumb over the
spigot
 Probably not how is your esophagus after
that
 How many fingers am I holding up
 How many members of The Mighty Nein are
there
 Shes okay
 Its true
 Jester help her out there shes in need
 Looking at our map how much longer do I
think we have to go to get to our destination
 We want to rush You want to rush Lets
take it slow and were going to get to the swamp
just as the sun is going down if we rush and that
is full of nasty things Im sure
 If we go slower
 Yeah
 You all are an enjoyable lot it will be
fun
 Maybe a little
 Carefully
 Not willynilly not galloping pace
 Twice yes
 We saw that
 Ive spent a long time on the road too
 There are a lot of soldiers ahead and I
dont think we should have anything to do with them
 Thats a very good point
 Your background would tell you if you chose
a background what bag of shit you have
 I have for two minutes been thinking
 If
only I had the Mending spell
 
 How tall is the grass around here
 Wheres he from again
 Druvenlode
 Where are you all headed
 Just carve it on the back of your DMs
screen like a prisoner
 Captain where are you headed en masse like
this today
 Do any of us see this
 Would you rather be headed there or where
youre heading
 Stay safe as well Thank you
 Good trick
 I think we should camp because then we
will hit this swamp at a more advantageous
moment
 How frequent is it
 A couple of times you have spit out
seawater
 Saline solution
 Hey youre not supposed to drink that
stuff Its for rinsing
 This weeks episode brought to you by Bausch
 Lomb
 Silver thread around the fire
 How many of us can fit under that cart I
wonder
 Disgusting
 Were going here
 Silberquel Ridge perhaps Hupperdook is
beyond that mountain range
 It is a big group of us yeah Is there
enough people left over to do the last watch
 Oh your eyesight is better than mine
 The storm
  Never say goodbye
 Oh man Jester and I talked about
everything Like everything About childhood
favorite kind of ice cream We know everything
about each other now
 Im going to mull it over in my sleep good
night
 Whats the temperature like right now
 We have to be miserable right now because we
are soaking wet and it is cold
 I am working on a thing I have not got it
figured out yet but I think that I could make
some sort of shelter for us so that this doesnt
have to happen again I havent worked out all
the what
 No magic of course But I dont have the
Ive been working on it but I havent struck to the
 Well I always need those things but I need
more time and more research
 Thank you Mollymauk
 This sucks
 I have higher hopes of I mean this is a
long ways off but I would love a large home or a
mansion of some kind that you can  on a
whim Doesnt that sound amazing
 We have all of us seen magic in our lives
 Nothing is impossible
 That is correct
 You have faith so you should have faith
 Also Caleb has watched Beauregard go to
town on  pushups or something and I go maybe
 feet away and I try as well I do one pushup
and then I go study Siff Duthars spell tome some
more instead of going to two
 Roll a 
 How far up is it about
 Okay
 Cart
 In addition to the insects do we start to
become aware of wildlife around Birds and
beasts
 Im good at nature Ive lived in the woods
for a long time
 On the plus side I think sitting in the
cart that Caleb is probably the cleanest he has
been in two years because its been raining non
stop
 I cast Mage Armor on myself
 Thats not a good idea
 I would say that Caleb has spent a lot of
time over the last several years in woods Can I
check to see if I have ever heard that cry
before
 That is an 
 Fjord regurgitates saline solution
 Were just getting into this swamp right
now right
 Its your proficiency plus your wisdom
plus eight
 Do we even see her anymore
 Yeah Luck is for suckers man
 Also its important that it is kept
hidden
  as well
 Im on a log
 Oh I am Okay I am going to stick a root
of licorice in my mouth like a hayseed like Im
Fjord and cast Haste on Nott Read this because
your armor class is up you have an extra action
per round you have advantage on dexterity saves
I will do my full movement forward  feet
 You have an extra action Yeah
 You can use the extra action to go closer as
well
 Or extra attack
 I love this cleric
 Thats fucking dumb
 Screw you Snitch
 Get them ninja stars out
 Theyre darts I think theyre homebrewed
darts
 I think thats the first time any of us have
ever done that
  He did it
  Light the corner of my mind
 Whats that spell do
 I think that I see one of the giant gators
is getting close to Nott and also Yasha so Im
going to tug really hard on the Glove of Blasting
and revolve around my wrist three times and use
Scorching Ray
 Edubation Say again
 Three attacks advantage against the target
correct
 First one is a 
 Okay Second one is a natural 
 Third one is a  So they all hit
 Ja Here we go Dang it Total of  fire
damage
 Ja Then I will keep wading through the
shit try to get a little bit closer
 And say Hey Fjord isnt this fun And
thats it
 But what if you get a natural  Roll
again in case you get s
 We got a natural 
  on your AC
 Ja it seems like Im can I get within
 feet of it No correct I would think probably not
 Just out of  feet
 I am going to cast Magic Missile at level
three because hes got my little friend
 That is five missiles total Here we go
 Total of  so 
  Disappointed
 Is he flanked with Yasha
 Advantage
 Roll again
 Its like the Simpsons Frogurt scene
 Oh just when I think Im out they pull me
back in
 Sure
 This one not this one
 Yes
 But does an unmoving body move
  Would you like to
phone a WotC friend
 Matthew Mercer How do you want to do this
 Maybe shes vibrating on the ground Like
when a pager goes off
 Good narration DM Good narration
 Ja hallo
 Its worth  which is what I need for my
spell ja
 Aint you got no long range
 Out of context quotes
 A purple worm erupts from the middle of the
floor
 Caleb is watching all this
 I could it would take an hour but I could
understand this one if I set my mind to it
 Oh No No please No please no
 Im going to pull my coat shut
 Or does he want to draw
 Empire kids wouldnt know
 Kenku
 Like ravens they are able to mimic many
sounds
 I mutter that to the group
 Are you able to handle yourself in a scrap
Are you good with a weapon or
 To my question though are you able to
handle yourself in a dangerous moment in any way
 A monk
 Many seconds What do you need
 Since he brought me over what do I make of
the same
 Yeah That is a 
 Just looks like a bunch of old crap to be
honest
 Did Jester spend hours doing that
 If she did then Caleb would have spent one
hour to cast Comprehend Languages as a ritual
spell to talk to her full on
 Im going to walk Kiri away from this for
the moment and say after an hour has passed of me
understand you as clearly as you can understand
me Do you want to tell me anything about your
time in this swamp or what you want to do with
yourself now that you are alone or how we can
best help you Or anything you want to tell me
 Okay
 Well in the meantime while we are looking
for them is there anything that we can do for you
or is there anything that you can tell me about
your last days here
 I mean their are hoots and whistles are
some form of language arent they
 Will she be welcomed in a town
 DM you said three or four five hours for
Jester to do all of that gator carving before
 And thats what you did
 Than I use arcane recovery Thats all I
wanted to ask if I had time
 Well I think we should do what we have done
well so far which is to improvise It is better
to bring her with her and then leave her and then
if we find an advantageous place to leave her
then we will But for the time being she is a
sidekick
 Do you know cats Do you like cats Do you
know cats
 Do you like cats
 Into her hands Frumpkin starts to purr and
nuzzle
 Yeah I ask Frumpkin to do a blep
 And to lick her face
 Hes friendly That is my cat If you want
to spend some time with him you can He is very
soothing for me anyway Give it a shot
 I just want to point out that if we pick up
one more stray there will actually be nine of us
 Thats true
 It can be both
 Caleb takes off his cloak and puts it on
Jester I never wear a cloak when were not in the city
 Look you guys we are trying to make it
work
 Jester took most of the day to harvest a
gator
 Febron Keyes in the Keystone Pub
 In the Puddles
 Puddin
 Just pull that cloak way down
 Thats a Percy mask
 Also very important question how is Kiri
doing with Frumpkin
 The only way to get in is an eightfoot
climb on a rope
 Oh dear
 I start to pull the silver thread around the
edges of the cart
 All of us can get in but anybody else will
set that off
 Man what a great scene between husband and
wife
 No shes coming with us
 Do you know what booze is
 Well get her a Tirley Shemple its fine
 All over the place really
 Bon or Barn or
 Let your eyes adjust to the room
 I have it
 Thats easy for me to do
 Okay
 Eins zwei drei Snip
 How old is Berleben in general
 Wow
 Theres a fancier part of this town
 Are they below the water level here
 From the bottom
 That would be a thlevel spell thats
beyond
 We could also drag you back to The Gentleman
if youd prefer that instead Or you could point
us in the right direction and let us take care of
it
 That is a 
 Well you know
 keep it simple stupid
 We are very aware that he has sent us into
something more troublesome than he has described
and we are willing to do that Were told you are
the one who can get us in the right direction
Well be very disappointed otherwise
 Thats a persuasive Jessie
 Damn it Jessie
 Because Matt doesnt want to sing
 Im going to give you all my gold That is
one
 No I have two silver and five copper
 How Broke Am I
  Power ballad
 Well he is staying with us this evening
 I highly doubt it I mean its possible
 Insurance No we are in a podunk town
there is no insurance here
 Well weve been here an hour there are
seven hoursish left on the spell Thatll get us
through most of the night
 What alls in there You have the
 Sure I thread the cart but you have the
thingy
 Thats the most important thing
 Im fine to send it
 Also Nott I would not worry
 the spookiest
thing in this place is us
  Quick conversation
 Just quick
 As the hooligans are getting ready for bed
obvious reasons now I have kept a lot of things
close to the vest and those things are out If
you ever want to talk about anything now or
later after you think about it you are my
friend and you can talk to me if you want
 I cant see you through your booze
 Im clean right now
 I mean an hour in yeah but we were in the
rain for like  hours
 Yeah did Laura Bailey put you up to this
 Youre getting ahead of yourself okay I am
a garbage person Lets put that on the table But
while I am a piece of shit we can help each other
in the short term This is going further than I
anticipated I just meant that if These
people we are with are all interesting and
great and untrustworthy but great but I trust
you which wasnt really true three weeks ago I
just mean I wasnt I dont know words dont do
it Talk to me if you want
 Gute nacht
 Hanging brain
 Febron is totally telling his friends that
he nailed a barbarian
  So I had her alone right
  Its me pheromones
 Each page is a centimeter thick though on
this book
 But theres illustrations maps curse
words colors
 Punisher skulls
 Mountain range
 I remembered Matthew
 No Englishmen
 She was the last one
 He would totally do that
 Frumpkin walks to the edge of the table and
shows his butthole by lifting his tail up
 I just cant believe he got here
 Oh well we have an hour
havent been hired by any creepy people in dragon
masks have you You dont know anyone like that
 Edubation
 You want to have a big bowl
 Also Im wondering if she seems
straightforward Is the nervousness an act
 Yeah okay
 Its a 
 Okay
 Could go either way on that
 Also why do these people want the bowl that
youre talking about
or religious symbols anywhere on their person
 This is a very tactless question but you
are talking about the Scaled Tyrant and you also
are sporting some scales Is that a coincidence or
are they related
nervous when they see them Im not diseased or
cursed or anything just yeah Ive
 Were pretty cool
adjusts the cloak and you can see the whole left
side is black dragon scales and her hand is a
draconic claw
the cloak Im like a tenth dragon and some people
get freaked out by that
 Hes work for hire
next to Caleb away from this guy
 Frumpkin travels over to Kiri and starts
going  as he nestles against Kiri
 The cat is with me
freak out
 I take a step and a half away from Cali
 Caleb Yeah
 This is probably stating the obvious but if
you have not picked up on it yourself we are kind
of a pack of assholes
 Yeah we are Because when we write the name
down its actually the Zemnian word for no So
even if theres nine people then
 Under the lake
 You always want to stick together You never
want to split the party
 This group is very inclined were very
skilled in arcane things What is your specialty
magic from books and some people get magic from
gods and stuff right
 Gods and stuff ja okay
blood Im told has magical essences to it
 Yes Cool What can you do with it
of fire and acid mainly That seems to be related
to the type of dragon Im from
 Ja effective
fire Varying of degrees of fire really and acid
 Do you have maybe one Bside besides the
fire
I can drain life force and invigorate myself a
little bit
 Okay
 Theres so much quicksand in this swamp Im
feeling trapped I feel like we have a little bit
of overlap you know Im able to
 Nein
number
 Step off Tiamat
 If need be but you know Wait for the need
to be
 I like where we are positioned what do you
think
said that Im to do whatever so Ill go wherever
 It was a joke
 I said Hi Beaus
 I know But I said Hi Beaus
 The gators come from the left
 Survival
 This is generally how it goes
 Not a problem Bren would you help our
friend out
 Babys in the way Get used to it
 Fire Bolt
  for Fire Bolt
 Okay That is not that much actually
 That is a 
 Yes
 If you give me six second increments Im
just going to go 
it as well
 Which bolt do you cast
 Good rolls
 Well thats one in an entire swamp of
vegetation So we should be good now
 That is correct
 North is that way
 Frumpkin Im going to sit on a relatively
dry spot if I can find one Im going to go blind
and deaf and send Frumpkin in the direction with
Jesters help towards the sound that she heard
Water dry out some of the area
 I will give the group a basic narration as I
see these things
 My basic perception check is not too bad It
is a 
 What was that word
 How much of it are Frumpkin and I looking
at Its one little ditty or are we talking True
Detective here
 I dont hear shit
 Its hanging from a tree
 I am going to send Frumpkin up the tree
 I am going to send Frumpkin toward the
branch
 Like sealed or nailed in so its hanging
down
 Okay what I would like to attempt to do is
send Frumpkin up to and stick his head inside and
as soon as I get a little peekypoo snap my
fingers and bamf him out into the Fey
 A big 
 Remember when I used to get a 
 Oh yeah like I was saying to you there is
a tree out there and there is something sleeping
in it
 No but there are a lot of bones there They
looked like
 They are not chicken bones
 Well they were probably smaller than that
yeah
 There was something in the corner Something
that was not bones but it wasnt moving
 It definitely wasnt the thing were
looking for
 I did not see a bowl I made a perception
check
 Yes not bowls just bones
 Save it for a rainy day
 This ones a gimme a bonus only if we feel
up to it
 North is
 North is no it is that way
 Youre pointing over there Im pointing
over here North is that way
 A compass
 Well a couple things one this is a
compass
 Thats not an issue But if you want to know
if somethings happening here with Salty Pete we
can also do that if you give me ten minutes But
it doesnt seem like thats what youre
 I do not know where the safe house is but
anywhere we have been we can get to again
 Febron Youve been through this swamp once
or many times
 Its a bit late in the game but are you
being completely forthright with us Is he
 That is a natural one
 Can I make a suggestion Febron And I cast
Suggestion on Febron
 I feel you should be completely honest with
us from this point on because you know honesty
its the easiest thing to remember
 Its that way
 If we dont move thats also a little
weird
 I walk in the opposite direction
 Lets go I say as I walk backwards
 That mini
 Oh the tails there
 Just pull it over here for a second
  What is it
 So youre saying theres a chance
 
 Thats the first time youre introducing the
word cult into conversation
 Cult adjacent
 So they did this to you
 How far back is he
 So if we feel like we want to get into a
scrap I or probably our new friend here could
kick it off from a ways away
 The troll
 Also you are very charming but every book
that I have ever read about trolls They do not
make friends They are bitter nasty things
 Its watching us right now isnt it
 Debatable whether it can understand us but
perhaps it can
 I would in fact like to try to walk behind
a tree so Im obscured
 I dont know if it can see me or not but I
would like to hold Magic Missile in case it
attacks my friends
 singing Peters Theme from Peter and the
Wolf
 Do you see it Show me
 Good
 Settle in
 Magic Missile
 Im going to cast at ndlevel
 Towards the back of the group never near
the front
 Magic Missile level two four darts total
of  force damage
 Dont fuck me Matt Mercer
 Did you speak up yet
 Of course you didnt
 Are we in difficult terrain here
 Although youve got your shoes on yeah
 I will use my movement first I want to get
as close as I can which is  feet or no you
said the closer we get
 Yeah you know I went through a whole range
of emotions because first I was going to try to
hold it but then the guy was dead so I was like
fuck it Ill switch to a Fire Bolt but then he
grabbed Beau so I am going to use the Glove of
Blasting and cast Scorching Ray on it because I
cant reach for anything better
 Yeah
 I dont have that
 Im going to cast Magic Missile on its
head
 Yeah
 No Im going to cast fucksticks Im
going to cast Haste on Nott Thats what I do
 Yeah Your AC is up an extra action
 Its all happening like this
 Wow
 Lie down play dead
 I mean shes half melted but
 We got to cut that dead weight man
 Nott is double speed and has a ring on for
water walking
 Marry Poppins
 Oh cocked Super cocked More
 Yes its in my range I will walk  feet forward
and cast Fire Bolt from here Its a foot range
 Oh thats not the d hold on Thats a
natural one
 Matt were still in the middle of nowhere
at this point or were
 We dont have our guide anymore Ask this
one which way to go
 As far as we know
 Its cursed hiccups
 Ill say while Jester was doing all that
Caleb sat down and took out his spellbook and
started ritual casting Detect Magic
 Well maybe after I do that because Im
tapped
 Thats very Wildemount thebowmeister
 Scorching Ray on Beau
 I told you everything You have to die
 Yeah
 Well its like blacklight so on everything
on what they were looking at
 Is Nott glowing in any kind of way that I am
not used to
  feet I believe
 You my good friend would you walk with me
in the direction that the dead person said that
this entrance is in Before my magic runs out
 Youre right Person that I work with would
you walk over before my spell runs out so that I
can use it to help the group
 Caleb knows exactly what time it is Liam
likes to burn his friends
 Towards the foot mark that the
 So it glows
 Would I know about this
 
 Obviously not part of the okayed deities of
the Empire
 Shes talking about herself
 It seems like a very large task for one
person
 The tree is not giving off anything no
 No I do not know how to do it
 Nott I have limitations I can do many
things like you
 Is the water up to our waist now
 Shes as small as a tree knot you know
so cute
that
 You dont know any of the fact that I almost
killed you Marisha Ray
 Yeah what I was trying to do for us
 Maybe theres two branches
 This is all meta conversation You guys have
no idea that Liam almost used the wrong spell
Caleb was on point
 Are there any immediate threats in there
Fjord
 Outside
 and puts light up in the tree out there
with her
 Im outside with her and Im casting Dancing
Lights into the trees so that she can see better
 Please we have been around death plenty of
times Caleb throws up quietly into the water
 Yeah I can do that
 Yeah I am I have just joined the group
How are you doing down there what do you see
 With you and me it goes back and forth
 All right we can do that Just stay put
dont go rushing in without us
Is it one or more than one
 Thats the opposite of what I said
 Its hard to resist sneaking in
 It has been a while what would you like us
to do
 Already
 Yeah weve established that Stay put
dont move
 I drop Frumpkin down the shoot
 No hes not
 Yes they can
 My acrobatics or the cats
 Oh great hold on Ive got that pulled up
right here hold on
 
 I dont know
 Oh wait Kiri is down here with us in the
corner
 Well I think thats a great idea but we
should also send Bren with you and if you guys
could go simultaneous like Maybe if Bren hit one
of them and then you follow right away
told us about that are around the corner Like all
the crates and stuff I mean my bowls should be
okay but are you here for something
 Sometimes Im able to focus just shy of what
Im trying to target
Im not sure I could try
 I still think that these two would be good
to lead that charge
 Are they still talking
 Does anyone want to try to talk to these
things or are we just 
 I like how that sounds 
Murderous fish men
 I love it
 Were glossing over it but weve seen you
vomit sea water twice
 Drei
 Zehn
 Yasha and then Nott and Caleb are equal
 Caleb and Nott got ten ten
 For six seconds
 Big three
 Scheisse
 How highs the ceiling here
 Thats how it works
 You want me to go Yeah sure Im going to
move forward until I can see no Frumpkins
going to go first Im going to pull a Shakste
and use Frumpkin to help me see in here
 I have to ask you as a DM can my cat see
in the dark
 I dont know it doesnt say
 I dont remember but I know that my cats
could see in the dark growing up
 Im going to stumble forward in the dark
 I cast Enlarge on Beauregard so that shes
ten and a half feet tall
spell still would be going so Caleb might be able
to see the first area
 If thats the case then I wouldnt go that
far forward I would stay as far away from danger
as I can that as soon as I see Beauregard cast
Enlarge
 Theres Amazon women singing right now
 You got to pull a Vega position
  feet behind you hear
 This is all I
wanted
 Thats an action
 Caleb is going to walk behind Cali so hes
got a good view of merman over Fjord Im going to
use the Glove of Blasting First one is a natural
one so that does not hit The second one is a
natural 
 Against the one right over Fjord So that
is Scheisse
  total since it was a crit Is it still
up
 And the third ray is not good just a ten
 Careful of your head
  Add that d motherfucker
 Cocked
 Haha good show
  I got friends in eldritch
places
 Roughly a minute later I say
 So you have
been somewhat charmed by a circus carnie Its
going to be okay
 You seemed a little angry He didnt mean
anything by it
 Just trying to keep everything copacetic and
in order
its fine I do understand why Its fine Thank you
 I mean you have a lot of scales on your
face but look at this one Look at this one Look
at this one
 That one as well
well Youre really lucky
 Im going to investigate
 Yeah Ive got a high stat in it
 Cocked
 Well it was on a magnet so it was stuck to
a magnet
 At advantage Well call the first one
which was a three on a magnet and the second roll
was a  plus my eight is a 
 I can do this for the future
 So 
 Distribute that equally however you would
do that
 I put a bunch of jewelry into Jesters
hands
 Id like to take these for a moment Or
maybe ten moments
 I would propose I just rolled a  on
perception to see if Caleb noticed Nott even do that
 Well but you rolled a  so it would be
super hard for anyone at the table to have seen it
 Is this the end of our task here
 Im taking those two purple vials and
walking around the corner over this way to set
them down and start doing my thing and Im going
to start pulling out my book
 I instantly cast Identify it takes one
minute on the two vials and the bowl
 Im over here
 We might be the third from the worst
people
 But it needs a lot of blood
 What about the vials
 That sucks Nothing to be told okay I
dont want this
 No
 I dont know It is not of any use to us I
dont think
 I stick it into my satchel for the time
being
 What if its beyond even what Fjord has just
seen We do not know what we are talking about yet
 You know we could rest up here on the back
corner of this chamber I could cast my silver
thread across this pool here on the other side If
anything comes through it wakes us up Well be
ready We get ready for going further and
 What if you spend one more night with us
here
seem so nice and youre the first people I could
even say that Ive made friends with but this is
too important
 Tell us again What do you need it for What
are your intentions with it Honestly look me in
the eye What do you mean to do with this thing
when you find it
 How will you destroy it
Ill find a way if I have to but I just The
biggest thing Im afraid of is that the cult and
Serissa theyll find somebody like me Theyll
find somebody descended from an ancient dragon
like I was Then they can do this all again I got
away once I cant let that happen to someone
else
 Yasha will you come here please
 I need your help Mollymauk will you come
here please
 Beauregard Fjord will you come here
please
 I start to move away from Cali
 Would you come back with me Jester
please
 Once there is a defensive wall between me
and Cali I pull the bowl out of my bag
 No
 No Kiri Bren found the bowl Cali I would
like to help you but this thing is powerful
 And I met you ten hours ago
whole reason I came here is to find that so Let
me put it this way You care about these people
You care about this group
 Yeah I do
find you I know more about them than you I can
hide I can stay away from them
 Well I have a wonderful compromise You
know we can all camp down here as I suggested
you included In the morning my good friend
Jester can get to the bottom of your intentions
for good For real
 What do I do dex as well Oh its gonna be
so good
 Thats a two so I think this story is over
Aw the second one was an  Aw Three
 Why would you not want to wait  hours to
see if this womans intentions are true or not
 What difference does it make This bowl
 This bowl that I am talking about can be
used to speak to one of the most evil entities in
the history of creation so I think it warrants
another  hours of waiting to get to the bottom
of things
 I think it is going to be a little bit
beyond your capabilities to destroy this bowl
Yasha
 That bowl is used for communicating with
 the mother of dragons
anything else Are you resting now or do you wish
to take this time now
 Beauregard You keep the bowl all night so
that Jester can use the spell she used in the past
for truth and then we ask Cali and I would love
to hear that Calis intentions are true and good
If theyre not well find out
 Friends One minute
 Yeah okay I suggest you tell us the
absolute truth of your intentions with this bowl
either destroy it or find somewhere secure that
the Cult of the Caustic Heart servants of the
Scaled Tyrant cant find it because they knew my
power They knew that Im descended from an
ancient black dragon from far away If they find
another one like me they could do terrible
things I promise you Mr Caleb I promise you
that all I want is to right some of the wrongs
that I once did as part of that group I helped
kill people I helped torture people Ive got to
make this right and thats the only way I can do
this I dont know much but I know that the only
person that can take that thing and make sure its
not used for ill is me
 Im glad for you to take it Im a little
surprised at the rest of you for me being
cautious but Im glad for you to take it
 Are we separate or are we not separate
 Beauregard what if she had been lying to
us
 I told you exactly what I wanted to do and
why
 I dont know what youre talking about And
I walk away from her without saying another word
 Highly
 Drama
 God I cant believe thats already been
that long
inspired by Crit Role and we started our show
and weve gotten to the next part of our
adventures
 Caleb starts silver threading the entrance
that Fjord swam through
 The moment that they exit the pool well
know and it would wake me up or you up or
anybody up
 Frumpkins hair gets poofed out and his tail
floofs out and he starts growling at the sound
 Is it my turn with the dodecahedron
 I do
 Did you use it
 I more want to examine it
 No Can I borrow the bag
 Im going to spend maybe a halfhour before
bed not trying to use it but just examine it
 
 Well this evening Im going to use it for
the grand purpose of being my pillow in the bag
so Im going to sleep
 Its in the bag
 Does my head do this
 Im awake
 Theyre awake
 Ah fish Nott
 No down below in my
 Yeah
 Wake up
 Im going to send Frumpkin to crawl down and
get a look
 Its fine Good four
 Oh we left the corpses out
 I dont know
 No  feet
 I actually have no memory of anything on
range for bamfing in and out but I will defer to
you because youre my DM
 Ja there is one down there right now and
he tried to kill my cat
 Am I able to prepare Magic Missile like a
held spell for a fish head popping out of the hole
 But Id lose the slot if I held the
 I wont do that then but I will watch the
hole
 I have no lights up so I should be at
disadvantage right
 Im going to roll again What does that say
 No I had to Fire Bolt so it wouldnt matter
how long I held it My lower is a 
 I just watched all that
 Im going to pull out a rag and do my veiled
lantern thing with Dancing Lights
 Put one of what things up
 Down there You want me to go down there
 Im going to send Frumpkin down again
 Come on Frumpy Nine
 Someone told me that cats have advantage on
perception Are they full of shit Youre my DM
Would it cancel out is why Im asking
 I will
 So cancel
 Thats pretty good Perception 
 He could watch but the alarm is just as
good Its automatic gets me up Frumpkin can
sleep After you
 Ja
 
 I have my hand on Yashas enormous rippling
shoulder
 I need about ten minutes In the dark I
pull out the thread and I start doing the thing
 I cant do that but I will do that
 Well say that I said that out loud to her
 Nott had a wonderful idea for you to pick up
all of the dead things
 Lets get the shit out of here
 Im freaked out so Im going to stay up
with Yasha
 Perception 
 Could I back up one hour and ask Yasha a
quick question
 This is a small group for you you traveled
with the circus
 This is a big group for me
 Do you have any advice
 You seem awkward like me
 But you made it work with a lot of people
 Ive tried that too and it goes horribly
 I think it goes pretty bad
 Im confused did you have advice
 I start writing these things down
 It just rained though This is the cleanest
Ive been in weeks
 Most of the time Im trying to People
dont pay attention to beggars so much
 Yeah in general
 Youre as big as a giant barn you are hard
to miss
 Do you know what I miss
 Shaving
 One thing that I have realized today is that
I need to work on my interpersonal skills and
friendship making So try not to cut up my face
okay
 No leave my hair on my head but I have not
had a cleanshaven face in a long time
 No you can take it all
 You can crush a person but Im not quite
sure how dexterous you are so I dont want any
fancy tricks
 Okay
 Should I lie on the ground
 Have you done this before
 With that
 I lie on the floor
 Wait This means we are friends
 
 That might be better
 Four globules of light rise up around you as
you begin to shave
 Calebs inner monologue is
 I want to
shrivel up and die
 I take a brief moment with the dodecahedron
before handing the bag back to Jester
 Ill forget
 Its a bad idea for you to stay We would
need you
 Youre not very good at finding traps but
everything else youre quite good at
 How long has he been gone for
 Oh youre in here talking about what was
there
 I was distracted I was thinking about my
books I dont want them to get harmed Your bag
is probably water resistant yeah
 I do want to leave them with Nott Im going
to unharness the
 Yeah
 If you come after us would you please hide
them under a stone or something
 Two
 Yeah girl Yeah
 Zweiundzwanzig 
 Yeah Thats good Ashley
 Listening to their footfalls
 So pretty
 Here comes the smoke
 This is wrong This is right
 Thats still wrong thats right
 Dont fuck me Colville You fucked me
Colville
 Sechs
 Krav Maga
 Quick question
 From the fish guy up at the
top there if that was the corner of a cube would
it reach the one down by the lollipop
 foot cube excuse me sorry Thats
probably not big enough Thats too big right
Its too far
 If I were to hit the fish guy at the top and
make that the corner of a cube and go this way it
would probably only get two of them right
 Forget it Im going to cast Haste on
Mollymauk
 I cant see Its dark Im blind Its the
safer bet to aid my friend on the next turn
 You have just been Hasted and I am going to
move along the wall this way away from the enemies
that I think I can detect
 From the cavern behind us
 muffled air horn
noises
 Whats the lighting like in here
 I cannot see anything Im going to move
towards the sound of Jester shouting in the dark
and Im going to raise up the Glove of Blasting
and try to shoot the fishman that I heard way up
high ahead of me up the hill Theyll all be at
disadvantage
 The one with the staff at the top
 First ones 
 Second one is 
 And then that is also  so just one of
them hits
 That is six points of fire damage
 Okay thats it
 Double speed
 Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck
 Ja how far can I get towards this one
over there Even if it means going in the water
 Will I get within  feet of him
 Well show me how far
 Im going to try it Im going to wade in
 I was considering it its just not what I
wanted to do Im going to cast Dispel Magic on
the storm above me
 Everybody hears 
 That did not sound good
 Shield
 I will use the dodecahedron and roll a  on
this side I got a natural two
 I get to choose it says it on this paper
Alternatively after an attack roll is made
against me I can expend the fragment to roll an
additional d and choose So two plus whatever
 Caleb will remember this
 Thats cocked Youve got to take the good
with the bad
 Im going to save my higher stuff for the
guy whos disappeared so Im going to Fire Bolt
it right at pointblank range at disadvantage
 Ugh

 I rolled a two
 Im going to crouch down into the water and
submerge up to my neck in the hopes that it does
not know where I am and Im too short to be hit
 Flank that Yasha enemy 
 Advantage to disadvantage straight roll
 Ill take it
 Get out of here status thing
 What was the damage before DM
 Thank you thank you My web browsers going
insane I cant Hold on
 I have no internet right now I rolled a
six and I dont know what my con is because I
have lost
 Oh youre right I do after you asked me
nine times

 Does the exhaustion happen when the spells
broken
 Okay Earlier Im sorry because the
internet shit the bed on me so it was  plus 
Im still up
 Hes like this in the water
 Am I able to wade onto the land just behind
Beau there Yeah if I go in that direction can I
get off on dry land
 Okay Im going to do that and as Im doing
that Im pulling out my little clay cats paw and
Im going to hold Maximilians Earthen Grasp As
soon as I hear fish talking in the water Im
going to let it go
 Cats Paw
  Strength
 Yeah
 On a failed save the target must make a
strength saving throw Versus my 
 And it takes d damage Bludgeoning
damage
 Five points of bludgeoning damage
 Its so big
 Six total
 So a big muddy claw sinks into its tail and
pulls it down in place
 The damage doesnt do anything to its
spellcasting ability does it
 Okay So what do I take
 Im not going to make this Eight
 Yeah Im out
 At least you got an apology when you rolled
shit
 Sure Lets do this Thats a six
 This is like those Tatasciore spells Like

 Front of Molly
 Thats what you do
 Yasha
 Come on buddy
 Would Caleb have flown backwards when he was
struck before
 When Caleb was knocked down by Thunderwave
the first time would he have been thrown
backwards
 Oh I thought
 Should I make another death save
 Thats an 
 Thank you  Ow
 No you got to just do this
 Check out her book Motor Crush
came out so check it out
 A one a one and a two
 You look pretty bad
 Im good
 Whats that stuff up there Im going to
start hobbling towards the bottom of the stony steps
 I realize something in a panic and I trudge
through the water back towards the entrance and I
pull out the wire and I put it in my hands and I
please get my books and put them in your bag
please
  Your punishment will be more
severe
 Are you being careful up there
 Yeah you know Nott could have a look
around I could have a look around once Jester
returns with my books
 I start speed wading back  Are
my books dry
 But can I see them
 Are they dry
 Theyre dry Okay
 I recommend that you allow me to check for
magical problems Then once we know whats what
then you go in But that takes about ten minutes
 So I will pull out my spellbook and I will
use ritual casting to cast Detect Magic
 Theres a glow in the water as well
 Well Im not doing anything Im just
saying
 We know that there is something magical in
the pool itself and then you said the long wooden
box is glowing
 What kind of magic is coming off of the
wooden box
 Enchantment
 I dont believe that there is any kind of
protection or magical lock on that So yeah try
to pick the lock from a distance
  Dodedodedo
 Shes doing it from  feet away Hopefully
thats enough
 That looks heavy so first you hold that
Have we found everything Also while all that was
going on I was looking for a jagged cross with
two crescent moons in it
 Of those  or  that I saw I will take the
one that looks the most familiar to me from my
memory
 Im going to keep that
 Clearly thats whats glowing at the bottom
to my eyes
 What kind of magic school of magic is it
 I dont know I think you should put it
 Yeah lets put it down with that sword that
we found Mollymauk
 Do you want to see something
 Come with me okay
 Im going to lead Jester up to the top where
fish guy was at the beginning with his staff Set
it down and
 Were already up there
 Yeah I want to go up where all the little
thingies are
 Lets set it down just in case Okay Then
I pull out my spell book again and Will you hold
this for me
 Sit down with me I rifle through the pages
to the right one for Identify and the sword is
down Okay Im going to use this one You can
see and I start showing the different glyphs and
I start the ritual
 So it takes ten minutes to make the spell
 I thought it was just the long box that we
already opened
 If the box was solid enough thats true
 I would think there would be enough time
overlap though for Detect Magic to still have
one or two minutes left before we get to the end
of Identify So if that is brought over do I
notice any sort of glow from
 Okay So I mutter I pause my chanting and
on And finish my  minutes of ritual casting
 Wait Is anyone going to interrupt me before
I get to the end of Identify
 Yeah

 Just a bunch of sexual innuendo Matt
 Yes Theres a complete blade thats magic
 Caleb is furrowing his brow at everybody
arguing about this as hes  seconds away from
ending
 Lost Gone
 Jesters holding my spell book
 On sword and cats eye Its whatevers
sitting in my little
 The complete sword
 All this shit doesnt exist so sometimes
its hard to tell what were talking about
 This blade is called Summers Dance
 Mr Mollymauk
 I feel like this might be good for you
There is a kind of magic that I do not even
possess that allows you to vanish from one point
and reappear in another and this blade will allow
you to do it
 It is a very fine blade It is more lethal
than a regular blade and will allow you to poof
poof poof
 You can all argue over it but I hand it to
Mollymauk As well as the cats eye
 Is it one spell one item
 Okay next
 Youre welcome internet
 Could have waited  minutes but no
 You grabbed the stone before I had a chance
to finish what I was doing Why did you do that
 Why
 No
 I was him what does that mean
 Are you skipping any details
 Are you skipping any details
 I feel like were missing something
 Im going to cast Dancing Lights and scour
the room Is there anything were missing
 If you have  minutes to spare yes I can
 I begin ritual casting Detect Magic
 Oh man ritual casting
 Just one
 Can I take  seconds to see if it jogs my
memory since Im such a history buff
 Nope Big 
 I do not have any
 I heard that but whos got them
 I also have a propeller beanie and a bag of
chips and I heard you say that Who has them
 Were pretty sure we have them guys
 I hope we brought Kiri with us
 Nope
 I give Beauregard a hug and say
 I dont
know what Im doing Just go with it
 I look to Yasha
 Caleb doesnt laugh like that at all
 Thats not necessary
 Not Necessary Working on it
 Ja okay
 Of course I do
 You made Babs Tarr hide her head in her
laptop man
 Well my friends whatever we do we are
really fucked up At least Beauregard and I are
really fucked up
 Shit lets go find Vecna
 Reverse math We came from that direction
precisely
 Oh thats a Final Fantasy VII Materia
rogue
 Bling it out man Bling that shit out
 That is a literal description
 I defer to the group
 No Okay lets go I do not have a cat in
this hunt but whatever you want to do I will
support
 We also had no qualms about sending a highly
decorated richter to the guillotine so I dont
know why we are getting tied up over a troll
 I remember the way This way
 Oh boy I am right behind whoevers in the
lead
 Frumpkin is scarfing it on my shoulders
 Im a couple steps behind Fjord saying
that way once in a while
 That is a 
 Im sorry DM could you say that again
because I was busy rubbing it into Travis that
Caleb is stronger than Fjord
 We want the numbers though
 Feed me
 I was leading everyone back to where this
troll was
 I know exactly the direction of north and I
remember where we were that is a nine
 But I have perfect memory
 But it all looks the same
 It looks just the way I remembered it
though
 I would like to be on the absolute side of
the semicircle please
 You just touched his tail
 You cast Pass without a Trace on all of us
 Plus ten
 I thought that
 I will hold Fire Bolt
 I pull out the wire and say What are you
doing Throw it in
 Oh I could light it from here if you just
toss it down and dive
 Its hard to control
 If I could get a pair of scissors
please
 Ooh thats some stale dynamite
 Yes Natural 
 I like that the blast didnt knock him down
He was just so scared to death He went Ah
 
 
 A Firebolt goes from my hand That is a
natural 
 With my Vax die we will use this one That
is a three  Doubled is 
 I didnt actually even want to come here
Ah
 No Ill stay where I am
 Get up there and grapple him and Ill send
projectiles
 Its pretty high I reckon Nope that is a
seven
 Yeah okay so Im going to keep it simple
I will move as close as I can probably getting
close to Mollymauk
 Ja I will hit him with some Magic M No
Is he within splashing range of you all Did you
just get hit
 Ill hit him with Magic Missile
 The basic level
 Three four eight  total
 Oh this thing is way closer than I was
prepared for I take a little bit of molasses and
have got this Good And I start to back away
casting Slow as I go I will loop around by our
cleric He has to beat a wisdom save against 
 He can do an attack or a bonus but not
both
 It was a cube but Caleb knowing that would
put the troll in the corner and send the rest of
it in that direction
 Cant use reactions
 Ja
 Fjord Madeline Kahns back to life

 Just like Blink
 Can it do that if its Slowed
 But it doesnt anymore
 Oh is it Oh goodness this is
 DM in everything that Ive seen when fire
has been used on this creature did it splurt
 It seemed to splurt when I used fire
 I know but Fjord is right under it
 So Caleb shouts out should I burn this
thing now
 All right Ill hold on a moment
  Ah sorry buddy
 I just yell should I burn it And Jester
yelled Wait
 Im going to hold the Glove of Blasting
 Im going to burn it the moment Fjord
is in the clear
 Scorching Ray
 Yeah First is a  second is an  and
the third is a 
 They all hit
 I did A total of 
 There is I am with these people And I am
going to burn his head off
  Oh shit Oh shit
Fnf
 Ja
 Shook it off
 Good Good
 But Fjord is still here so there is the
important thing Lets focus on the good things in
our lives
 What is this word bougie
 Is that in Common Is that a Common word
 The Zemnian word for that is like seven
syllables long
 That is a big question mark at the moment
 Perhaps wait until you receive word from
him
 Well he has a better eye on the situation
than we do Hes right in the thick of it now
 Is there anything of use or value here At
all
 You two just became that Muppet meme that
was made
 Vex is back
 There is a halfling wrapped in parchment
paper underneath the shop
 Are you interested in him
 No we are on a bit of a time crunch
 I walk directly up to the bar
 Yeah Im good on drinks I was just curious
what it is that youre reading
 For a question Okay
 Just a nine
 Is it fiction
 I am so starved for a good book Weve been
in the wild for a while I dont suppose theres
I doubt it but is there any place to find
literature here
 That sounds terrible How long does it take
for it to get here
 I commiserate for your thirst for fiction I
struggle with it myself How far in are you Are
you almost finished with it
 Is it a page turner
 Okay Im obviously just a little bit
jealous but I dont want to take you away from
your reading time
 Nine
 No thats fine enjoy I give her a wink
and I go back to the table
 We plan a heist for tonight We wait until
shes asleep
 Its about Vax

 No I want to go for a walk on the edge of
town for something
 Yeah of course
 Yeah of course
 No we are not going to get in trouble
 Nein
 Nein
 Be good Just going on a stroll ja Were
not going to kill anything youre not going to
you know Just taking a walk
 You are pretty cute Come on
 This is so silly Im looking for a good
stone
 No Something with a little bit of heft to
it
 Not exactly I dont really have anything
specific I guess Ill know it when I see it
Something about yea big You know my father used
to tell me that if a stone had a ring around it
all the way it was lucky
 Yeah like a natural formation a
coloration right It doesnt matter though I
start looking for a stone
 A good one
 I will make the check with your help if
thats okay
 Okay That is a 
 Oh That is a 
 A stone about as large as a malformed
baseball I suppose
 Is there a ring around it
 Thats a lucky rock
 Im not sure exactly I have some ideas
 Cali
 I mean does an armored bear shit in the
woods Oh yeah I want to see it Let me see it
 Ooh thats a good one Ja
 I mean I could use it right now but that
seems detrimental If I had proper funding and
materials but maybe later Im going to keep it
safe for the moment
 Neither did I but were figuring it out
 Ja that was fine Shes probably a good
egg
 Yeah shes a prickly pear but shes not a
bad person
 I think you and I are a little Eh in our
own particular way
 I mean shes abrasive but that has its
uses Right tool for the right job Right Kiri
 Kiri knows what Im talking about
 Youre good Youre still good
 Things are looking up I think
 Thats a good name Names are important
 Got my rock
 Kiri come on
 The gimp we were joking about under the
floor of that place
 That place is very busy
 Yeah but theres a war brewing and that
place is the center of it all
 I thought we were on a timetable to get
these things done for the Gentleman
 Aint no party like a Hupperdook party
 So youre asking if we would like to pool
our resources for a handful of these diamonds for
a perilous situation
 I would rather you as an accomplished
healer knew where the diamonds were on your
person and got them licketysplit rather than you
looking through my  pockets to find the
diamonds
 But yeah I agree with you that we should
pool our resources that is a good idea
 This is a little diamond I use for that one
thing I do
 No this one I spin it and surround it with
arcane energy and no it does not go away
 Its a very studied practice I spent years
learning how to do it
 Could you let her keep the diamonds
 Traveler take the wheel
wheel
 Just a minor thing While were traveling
Im going to use my minor alchemy to turn a ring
of the wood in the cart Im sitting crisscross
applesauce and I make a ring of copper in the
bottom of the wagon and place this stone in it I
place both hands on the side of the stone and Im
trying to channel my knowledge and ability into
it Im futzing with it thats it
 I slap her hand
 I will also do it
 I will do it individually
 Ooh I got a five
 Wait a second I send Frumpkin skittering
off in that direction As hes leaving I say
Rub against some ankles And listen
 Any books
 Any books 
 To justify all of this hes been muttering
everything he sees Bones bone necklaces
pineapples
 Frumpkin comes around a corner and Caleb
sees that the entire party has left him in the
cart snaps out of it and scrabbles out and
starts hustling over that way
 Oh you did it again Thats not Percy
 Hes got his head shoved up the ass of a
clock right now leave him be
 Yeah what is Fjord doing right now
 I see that
 You look bored out of your mind
 Same same Me either So far so good
though right
 I mean the lot of it Weve been together
for weeks now
 Theres been some friction but were still
here
 Oh hell that was nothing to when you held
a blade to my throat But were making it work
 Youre a good guy I think
 What does he look like when I say that
 No I know what your face looks like What
does it mean Double rainbow what does it mean
 Okay
 I am from the north We have Brot
tomatoes and cheese and thats it
 What
 Well you teach me Good talk Okay show me
what youre talking about
 Thats a dirty picture
 No thats a dirty picture
 Burlap its all burlap
 What do the faces of the people who arent
talking look like
 
 And Caleb will tell the group
 Caleb is futzing again with the rock and
just sort of massaging the four days of stubble
that he has grown back and his facial hair comes
in as fast as Liams does so its already pretty thick
 Except for your eyes
 Your eyes are like blue crayons
 Ooh
 Were off the rails Were off the rails
 Youre so cool how do you fucking eat
gravel so hard Oh man
 
 Theres something deadly out there that
wants to murder us all in our sleep
 Yeah it could be Do you want to wake
everybody up or
 Well I cant see shit
 Okay well hold on a second Just wear my
cat as a scarf And she digs dammit my cat was
a girl but never mind He digs his claws into
Notts neck and hangs in
 And Caleb sits between Fjord and Beau and
loses his sight and vision and listens
 Fuck a duck

 Its a foot radius
 Do I get to make a perception check through
Frumpkins ears
 Yass
 Its a two

 No we just saw a hump right
 I pull out a wire and say Youre onto this
right This is a possible ambush ja
 Tell your man to check the cart
 Probably but give it a moment
 Tell him to do the Running Man
 Ja I can relate but just do it
 No no no switch to the Cabbage Patch And
I start punching Fjord and Beau in the shoulders
 Shh Quiet Be quiet
 I start quietly handing over everybodys
mouth Wake up theres an ambush Im scared of
Yasha but I do it anyway Wake up theres an
ambush
 Caleb will at this point once everyone is
awake Yasha was the last one go back in
to see what is going on Oh shit 
Notts being attacked Lets go And I jump out of
the cart
 I am doing my best Vax impression and making
my way through the grass
 Still stealthing
 Im trying
 
 And Caleb heard Fjord say that and just went
 and theres four globes floating above us
 Theyre really spread out How spread out
 Roughly how far apart are those two
 Okay Im going to hold Slow for one side of
the group if I decide theyre a threat if they
sound like a threat
 Yeah thats fine
 Caleb lets Slow fizzle
 Also leave one gift for us before you go
Because youre living
 Ja we have a cart Were good Is there
anything in the cart that is more interesting
 Back away from that cart please
 I am not taking their clothes but I am
interested to see what they are carrying
 Are you bullshitting us
 Are you bullshitting me now
 Im looking in his cart
 Thats a 
 Hows this working out for you
 Are you better or worse than when you
started
 Yeah head to the cities Work on a dock
Learn from your mistakes What the fuck are you doing
 Three strikes and youre out This is two
 Thats fine The next time we are going to
turn you into grease puddles so maybe find
yourselves a job in a store or a dock or a
restaurant even
 At least be good at it if youre going to do
that
 I walk up to this guy and I take the stone
out of my pocket and I place it against his
forehead and I mutter a few words under my
breath And now I know where you are at all times
and I will know if you are still doing this kind
of work and I will come and I will kill you
 Natural 
 Oh my god
 No hes a warlock
 No theyre going to leave him Weve got
one more of your This one take him
 Judging by the map how far are we from any
town
 Oh this guys going to die
 How far away are his friends
 Im going to pull my wire out and Message
behind hes here
 Its  feet I think Im going to check
it out Its  feet
 I just talked into a wire you dont know
Its fine
 The good news is were in the middle of the
wilderness and no one is going to find him
 I have a dagger and Im going to shove it
in his belt so hes not totally alone Hes
pantsless but with a dagger correct
 Oh I didnt see that I take my dagger
back Hes fine hes got a blade
 This is so dumb What color is it
 It is Oregon Trail
 Lets count the grains
 On a scale of one to ten one being like a
shitass swamp town and ten being like Rexxentrum
what does the civilization of this city look
like
 But not podunk
 Its builded
 Illiteracy
 He did it
 Especially at night
 During all of that yammering on the way up
I look over at Yasha and sigh out
 Thats it
  I am crazy
 Do we as a much taller United Colors of
Benetton pack draw a lot of attention as we walk through
 Rissa you mentioned culture Are there any
libraries here in Hupperdook
 The walkups are tough
 What do you do now
 Well we are a traveling group of hired guns
who can get shit done We are a varied group of
people Some of us learn and some of us are good
at smashing skulls We would do any kind of work
if it were presented to us Thats who we are
Were a motley group of assholes
 I was trying to defuse
 Steampunk Burning Man
 No you throw it
 Yeah throw it in the air
 Fire Bolt
 Pretty good Thats  plus something
 How did you do it
 For shits and giggles or what do you have
in mind
 Sure it went very good in the swamp with
that little one
 Are we just in an ocean of gnomes is it
like  gnomes all around us
 Im traveling with my hood up minor detail
as you were
 When people have libations they get up to
hijinks at night and that seems like the main activity here
 I pull out the silver thread and I start
going around the horses
 I want to listen Im going to sit close
by
 On the other side of the bar I cast Haste on
Jester while she is playing the piano
 I toss one gold in and say
 This ones for
the lady Very good
 Well the odds are that you are not going to
even see him in your room tonight so I wouldnt
worry about it so much
 Hes like a coyote You know what that is
  Diplomatic Immunity

 Yeah they like to fuck a lot is my point
 But if you want a quieter evening you can
certainly share the room with Nott and I for once
Its probably not as raucous a room but youre
welcome to it
 Im watching Nott and as soon as I see that
she has found everything that she is looking for
Ive got the copper wire ready and I mutter
going to kill you You have to run now
 Honestly the name really sells this place
We have been fascinated with it for quite some time
 Shes set in her ways
 They are almost as nimble as you
 Will it be dark where we are doing this I
worry about you know what I worry about
 No it just depends on the situation This
happens all over the city outside everywhere ja
 It is almost like a drunken CrossFit gym
Im sorry It is almost like a CrossFit gym
 I have two gold
 Perhaps our feathered friend is a little
more important than the horses and I could leave
my threads around her room and she would be safe
there I would know if there was a problem
 No but it does matter because you are a
young child and you need to get your rest and we
are going to be doing things that are quite
frankly not for your eyes
 We could get a babysitter
 Are you all right
 Are you sure I was planning to go out but
its awkward for me I thought you would be going
 I thought that we could give each other
moral support you know what I mean
 I think the child will be dead by the
morning
 No that is not a thing that is happening
You could ask Beauregard Thats not going to happen
 Ja
 Yeah that is the key
 if I want to No
perhaps Beauregard is fleet of foot She could
round you out
 I played with Mommy and I played with Judd
and now I going to play with you I will take a
rain check on that No thank you Jester It is
tempting but no
 No thats truthful Its obvious how
dexterous you are youre just gruff
 Ask if theres a cancellation fee
 Also you have to embrace yes and Fjord
Yes and not no but
 Are you honestly okay You seem very
perturbed
 Was it someone special
 Predictably I would like as I follow this
group around to keep one eye open for a bookstore
 I rolled a  for Buch
 It is hard to believe but I was able to do
the I danced the waltz and the tarantella
Its been many years
 I am very much out of practice and
 It does A little bit
 I believe it
 Is there anything else that youre hiding
from us Any other quirks or skills
 What are three more
 Wait Hold that thought So thats two
things
 And the third is
 And was that skill learned or innate
 Yeah study is key
 Thats true
 Im done here I walk towards the store Is
it open
 Oh my gosh I press my nose to the glass and
try to see what I can see Is there a lot of books
in there Or just a few books Or
 Okay
 Thats a 
 From what I can tell does it look like a
technical place where they are just making books
or do they have books for sale
 I cannot tell if its a happy or a sad
bookstore
  That was 
 One please
 Just a second Nott come here for a
moment
 Are you going to dance
 Yeah But later it seems like you want to
I think you should
 Well you should try it You should enjoy
yourself but make sure that either Jester or I
ties your mask on very tightly yeah
 I mean it would not be a bad idea
 All the same Maybe stay away from direct
light you know If you can stay a little bit away from it
 Ja and some people are smart and it wont
work
 That is exactly what I will do
 You should enjoy yourself
 I am not dancing so it is not really an
issue
 I dont think I should go late in the game
but I feel capable of this challenge
 We have eins zwei drei vier und fnf
 Barf saves
 Snap
 Come on Beauregard
 Ja hello my name is Caleb

 Its a pleasure
 Lets enjoy a good game Did you just say
May the best gnome win
 I am a very skinny man Lets do this
 Do not let me fall asleep face down in the
gutter tonight
 Grog die Yes 
 Yes its a good game Its just a game
  Laurentia liebe Laurentia mein
Wann woll
 Enjoying the fumes As they waft up again
  for me
 Nighty Mein never says die
 I feel like it might go out the back exit
instead of the front
 Aw 
 I swat him on the side of the face
 I do it again Its good
 Its good for you Drink
 Natural 

 I nod cooly for a second and I just turn
and go 
 That is one smooth seaman
 I like it as well but only if you can match
this diamond worth oh about  gold
 Give me something like that or theres no
deal
 Oh
 You could use it now
 Get it von Bismarck
 Theres three of you
 You you are very you are you are very
drunk
 Am I also very drunk
 I assume I take one hit point of damage Or
d from a monk
 Okay
  Oh The Mighty Nein is The Mighty
Nein The Mighty Nein is The Mighty Nein The
mightiest nine that ever neined
  Nine mighties mighties nine
 I thought we were going dancing
 Okay
 Thats cocked Thats okay With advantage
you say
 Thats very low Very low That is a five
 Out there dancing
 You were always a better
dancer than me Astrid You were always so good
 Ja
 I break away Im sorry Im sorry
 I stumble away
 You are blue
  One of those things is true and
you are blue
 All five of my gold Do I have my
motherfucking books
 We are not going to start with the spell
that will lead us to it
 Of course I would
 Just a boulder parchment shears reference
Its simple
 If youre within  feet
 I was at the door I dont know how big the
place is
 I was going to do something before Jester
did what she did
 How could they even use them Because only
the winners that everyone saw won them
 Do you give a shit about our problems
 How many gold is that toy
 Are you speaking of an automaton
 So they have it penned in but it is out of
their control
 Fucking Hupperdook bureaucracy
 I wave my hands a little bit and say I
suggest you help this one find the things that we
are looking for and I cast Suggest
 That is  wisdom
 One of them
 Fitz
 Fitz I suggested that you do everything in
your power to help my friend Fjord and for the
next eight hours that is what you will do
 How much do these young men make in a day
here
 I want this one particularly working now
Why dont we stake their salary for the day We
take care of that double it even We need these
two We pay for the loss of their work today
 Octopi
 In a center spot
 Yeah the tokens
 We should probably keep our voices down in
the street
 Do we want to send Nott or a cat in
 No open windows
 There was a back door too
 Its not in character
 No parents at all
 How much have you hoarded up here Just us
or more
 Throwback
 Yes we are
 Havent you been working for the circus for
two years
 Does that mean that your cards are bullshit
 I am asking Mollymauk
 I want to say insight check so bad but I
wont say it
 DM will fill that information in
 We already have a job
 It depends on how altruistic this group is
We already have a job I mean I will defer to the
group but we have a job and we are on a time
table
 Ja so much for sticking to the plan
 I would like it to be predicated on us
coming up with at least a respectable plan not
willynilly fly in with our balls out
 Thats a lot of money
 String theory
 Eight hours yeah
 Do we have any food we can leave for them
so they dont have to
 I think she has a sleepover
 They are very capable children
 Kinder this is a thread I am going to put
around the chamber that you are living in and I
will know if our little feathered friend or you
all leave Youre perfectly welcome to Im just
letting you know that I will know ja Okay
 Do we want to leave it up to chance that
well run into those two kids that they will not
succeed or well find them
 Jester could we perhaps hold on to your
backpack before you go so that we have that in
case we need it
 Well I feel it is fairly obvious but okay
as you were
 Ja Okay so what are we doing now
 It is animated by magical means
 I am sorry I dont understand You say
theyre too busy to deal with it Have they got it
locked away in a vault while it just stomps
around
 Yeah they certainly have nothing to lose
We are a group of people claiming were here to
deal with their issue We either die doing it or
solve the problem
 
 Being as the mans daughter is standing 
here with us perhaps we will pass on that idea
 Yes I have questions about it as well
 Oh Natural one
 Its a good halflife
 Yeah so Herr Tinkertop once we are to
get past these defenses would dispelling its
arcane nature shut the machine down
 The nutshell protecting that core needs to
be defeated first
 And does it have any capabilities of
attacking at range
 Would it be foolish to have you speak on our
behalf to usher us in
 Yes youre finally ready to make amends et
cetera
 I have honey
 Yeah
 I have that as well
 I have molasses
 I will tell you that in a few minutes
actually if thats all right
 Its industrial grade it is not for
baking
 I am quite sure Did I stutter
 That is a good question Yasha I dont cook
with it I use it for arcane things
 I have about the amount of a plum wrapped
in
 That would be even better if we could get our
hands on
 That is a good idea Fjord Also Fjord
congratulations on this your most auspicious day
 Yeah Get your sleep while you can and
dont use the exercise ball to rock him to sleep
because then they get addicted to it and thats
the end of your sleep life yourself
 Oh no
 Yeah
 This is silly I take off the cloak that
Ive been wearing for a week or so now and I just
put it over the mans head
 No oh sorry

 To disguise his appearance
 I have an idea I could summon Schmidt and
it would be a slow process but he could carry it
a couple of inches low to the ground and wait
and then go a couple of feet
 Oh lets see
 Oh it is about that distance
 So it might be just shy or lets give it a
whirl Just give me tenish minutes
 Thats not bad I pull a book out of my
holster and flip to the right page and start
muttering Does anyone want to do anything in
those nine minutes left
 Ja Schmidt one second You two circus
people Mollymauk
 Could ah thats cute Could the two of
you do something fabulous over there
 Ja
 I preemptively send Schmidt over to the
closest bucket
 Ja that is correct
 Heres a question Im sorry How wide
apart is it bars the fence What kind of fence
do we have
 So that bucket is not going between any of
that
 Nott would you be able to use your
invisible hand to lift that up and over
 Okay
 So when he crashes right at that moment I
ask Schmidt to move the bucket three feet closer
to us Low to the ground
 Oh boy another ten feet towards me
 Yeah we dont want it off the ground
 Ill try to edge it a little closer still
Id like to get it near the fence if I can
 Okay then Im just going to wait for the
right moment Then Ill have Schmidt lift it over
his head but not yet
 Oh jeez I go
 Thats how you do it You set them up and
knock them down
 Not life just this campaign Taliesin
 Lets heat that tar up before entering
 Of course You have tasked experts with this
job
 Spiritual Weapon is a good idea
 That is incorrect
  I can speak when I have to
 No I can just talk
 And what will happen when we go inside here
Are you locking us in
 Until which
 Okay Nott can you lift that thing up for
me
 Well its going to scald the bejeezus out
of your hands if I
 Well I could semiburn your hands or not
burn Notts makebelieve one
 Everybody back away from this bucket And I
crackle my hands and send a Fire Bolt at the
bottom of it
 That is the most relaxed that spell has ever
gone
 Yasha could I borrow a torch from you
 So your hands are free to work
 Danke
 Lets try diplomacy
 Wow indeed
 I sneak up behind Nott
  I can open this if you need me
to I just like to save my shit
 Also if I were to unlock it it would be
loud so thats not good
 Oh thats good 
 Okay we can check this off our list
probably There are some dead inmates in here
 While people are moving around the room I
kick this off and dont mind getting its
attention I can magically unlock this door here
which will make a sound and then instantly lock
it If we wanted to we could all hustle inside
here and maybe attack at range Just as an
option
 Well I could be wrong but with what I know
how to do I dont think it can do that to this
door for a short amount of time
 Well Im talking about magic I can
magically seal this door Unless it has a way to
deal with that it will not be able to get
through
 That is 
 Impassable until it is broken or the spell
is dispelled or suppressed
 Okay
 Yeah instantly
 So you bruisers youre staying out here
 Wait
 I do not have the components I need for
Arcane Lock Damn it
 A lot of gold dust
 Into the last unexplored room
 Yeah okay Im going to back as far away
from that door as I can and I will send Frumpkin in
 Ladies
 Yep Oh I dont have the cat paper with me
in this state that Im in because I didnt know
Id be playing
 So I rolled a 
 I snap Frumpkin out of there
 Sam can you take a new picture and send it
to me
 Six
 
 Can you hear me right now
 Yeah Okay Ill go but I cant see The
map is a pixelated mess of shit from my point of view
After Mollymauk cleared the way is the thing on its
own Is it in a foot cube of empty space or
are any of my allies in it
 Slow is out the window I pull out my clay
cats paw and mutter a few words and I will cast
Maximilians Earthen Grasp A soil cats paw comes
up out of the ground and swipes It needs to make
a strength save 
  Its held in place and it takes d
damage Hold on It takes five points of
bludgeoning damage
 It has to use an action to break out
 If I can squish even one square further away
from it I would
 Just a reminder that everyone is rolling at
advantage while the Cats Paw holds it
 Meanwhile Travis is somewhere singing Dear
Theodosia
 Shield
 So it misses
 Oh that will hit Those will hit
 Thats not going to be good
 Good good good
 I also have to make a concentration check
 Hold on I rolled a three
 Well its still there Its just not
holding it Wait no its gone
 Matt was that  points of damage
 Yeah  Thats rough buddy
 What comes after Jester and I in the
initiative order
 Yasha does and then the thing
 Yeah I know Im having trouble thinking
straight because there is a blade through my gut
and my rib cage So I grasp the cats paw again I
dont try to pull myself loose and I cast
Maximilians Earthen Paw again Strength save
 Bad
 
 I spun myself like a pinwheel
 Low
 On what Nothings up
 That failed last time didnt it
 It can use a strength save to break out of
it and it exists but if I fail my concentration
check it goes right
 The second time it succeeded immediately
 It stays there
 Great Then that means its staying there
 Yes sir
 
 Dont throw away your shot
 That was a Chow YunFat moment
 Yasha
 Could you please come cast Pull This
Lamppost Out of My Stomach
 Who gets what now
 From Jester
 Im coming
 Caleb stops midsomatic gesture and says
Ah fuck this and goes back to the first door
and has a short rest
 Eins zwei drei vier
 Back at the front gate leaning against
or is that mine
 
 Yeah I have a little bit left in me
Mollymauk Will you help me up please
  Okay Point me at the thing
 I turn to Mollymauk and say
 Yeah the only
thing magical here is you friend Pat pat on the
cheek I wander back over to Beauregard and I go
to sleep again
 Make a FuManchu check
 You picked us specifically
 Look at it this way
 one path we could take
is that you are the mastermind who hired the right
people for the job and everything is perfect The
other path we talk about how we came in and fixed
things you could not
 Ja I think thats a fair deal Jester
would you mind settling this debt for us
 Your gold Laura or your maternal bond You
choose
 Man dont I know it
 Thank heavens for little blessings
 This could be our chance to find a good home
for her
 You like these kids Kiri
 Ja
 You know you spend enough time with us
Beauregard and I here almost died tonight Youre
just a little girl You should be playing with
these kids not playing with us What about you
Mom and Dad
 In exchange Beauregard
 We get into trouble quite a bit I feel
guilty bringing this young girl with us Weve
gone to great lengths to get you out and all I
cant speak for the group but all I ask is that
you give this girl some parents
 A what
 I tag along with Beauregard
 Hey Beauregard
 That felt pretty good last night Helping
somebody
 Do something good
 I get the sense that you have bigger plans
than that even Cobalt Monk I get a sense
 Well thats just semantics I have a feel
about you You and change I dont think that you
and I have the same plans but I think they might
overlap I would be willing to help you
 How do you mean
 Evil
 Surely neither of us are evil Beauregard
 Yeah I like that
 I think I can help you I think you can help
me I think we can do some good here
 I will do my best Beauregard
 Yasha
 What is on your mind Youre very quiet
Youre not thinking about leaving us again are you
 Well you tend to go mum for a while and
then youre gone Youre very useful for us We
could do great things together the notnine of
us I hope youre not thinking of leaving
 Well no ones going to bully you into a
decision but were all happy to have you here
You know my muscles are big They can accomplish
a lot but we do better with you around
 It was just a feeling I had
 I understand
 Nott and I
 With advantage
 You got okay Here comes Oh big eight
 Oh man what a foursome Holy shit
 We did the right thing with Kiri
 We did drain Lauras coffers though
 There was that
 No she doesnt Is that true
 Youre leaving
 Dont go
 Stay here And play DD for weeks and years
at the old folks home
 Yeah we are
 No I feel like Im in a bunker underneath
the ocean
 Theres just a half a second of delay and
thats all it takes to make feel like Im  feet away
 Can I be Terence Stamp
 Baryshnikov of Dungeons  Dragons
 Just you wait Travis Willingham The
chickens are all coming home to roost
 Not misery
 I stand up and scan the area
 What is that Thats a six plus something
Nine
 Are their weapons here
 I am going to sit down and bring Frumpkin
out and pull out my book and begin to do whats
needed to cast it again Find Familiar but Im
going to turn Frumpkin into uh a peregrine falcon
 Theyre probably skinny dipping somewhere
 I rolled a six which turned into a nine
 I know I am sorry I will change you back
as fast as I can I need you to look for the three
that you do not see here The green one the blue
one and the goth one Go
 Natural 
 Oh shit There was a This way I come out
of it so I dont trip on rocks Theres a struggle
this way And I lead the group back to this
 Here is what I am wondering
 why we are
still here Yasha and Jester and Fjord they
didnt know each other before a month ago
 If they were taken that means they came to
our camp and took her possibly And even if they
did not its not like we were hiding
 Youd take the three beefiest of a group of
strangers
 Do you want my notcat to go look first
 I send Frumpkin to do a lazy circle
 This is Your Life
 Hey Ashly Welcome
 The Laura Bailey bladder was right here
Whered it go
 Through the wire I whisper
weapons out Whats going on
 I put the wire away

  Just make conversation
  They have great sentimental value
  No Im good
  Its complicated
 Frumpkin lands on Notts shoulder
 We are well traveled
it
 Yeah shes all right
 Ah I like that
 My name is Caleb but you could still call
me Bush Man
 Well lets think about it
 Yeah
 Yeah Im scooping up the haversack
of a bunch of shitty lowlifes Theyre all
murderers Theyre all pieces of shit The people
that took your friends are the biggest pieces of
shit in the entire place
 When you say powerful are you talking about
ability or connections or both
 Shit
 This is why maybe they took the beefy ones
side of the road Which is why it seems like most
of you people got spared
 Im not very good at it either and you are
an exile
 You know we are some of us a
selfdeprecating lot We have some skill between
the four of us but it would help a lot to know
what kind of people not just assholes we are
assholes what kind of assholes we are talking
about
shit thats a rogue
 Are they part of a larger organization or
are they off themselves Its just them
Creek Run Theyre powerful
 I prefer Iron Fem Shepard
 Do we have an arrangement here A deal
 These three are of great value to us and
they are our friends and we are better off with
them and it is worth the trouble We cannot
accomplish what weve come out here to do in the
first place without them What
 You be the leader But do we have a deal
 Yeah I think we ditch the cart Theyve got
hours on us we need to make time
 And we cant carry their stuff without
 We leave the shield Its not a magical
shield its not special
 Its run of the mill
 Life is more special
 Ow what are you doing
 Go faster without a spare horse
 DM you said we could put the shield on the
side of a horse
 Okay
 Well then we shouldnt do that we should
go as fast as we can right now
 We set it free
 Or its free or somebody gets a new horse
 Pinch him off

 Which way are we going
 I said you were the leader
 Im not a leader
 Does it look like Frumpkin could make it
through that window
 And what hour is it
 In the afternoon I dont see anything in
there I mean you want to raid an old house or
keep going
 You want to cut for the day
 Shes the local
 Well thats what I was asking You described
a window that was jagged glass ja
 But if my smallish falcon went in there is
he going to get cut up
 Going to get cut
 Are there any books
 Books
 Nein
  Were killing time but yes I do I
take the ten minutes to take the book out of the
holster and set it on the ground and while
everyone just sits there in the dust I cast
Detect Magic
 Ten minutes
 Wait Wait
 Yeah
 Oh yeah I hear everything
 Okay what
 Dispel the spell
 What are we running from
 I keep looking over at you and thinking Im
on the Jerry Lewis telethon
 Drei
 Oh wow The suspense
 Can I use my natural  now
 That time its a three
 Oh guests first
horse
 Yeah I go rummaging through my pack really
quick and I pull out a licorice root and stick it
into my mouth and bite onto and I start muttering
to myself and I say Pick up the pace and I
cast Haste on Beauregard
 And then I will move as far as I can towards
Nott
 Towards Nott ja
 Okay
 Advantage on dex saves too
 Yes
 Get it
 Right in the ball sack
 Street Fighter combo
 Wow
 Time travel too far
 I feel the wind and then shoot three Magic
Missiles out of my hand at the thing
 Thats a four and also  six Ive
got to change this dice that is a ten total
 Was ist los
 I will go crouch by Nott
 I didnt make any noise I just sit down
  Hello my baby
 Does it have Jesters shield on it
 Its suffering put it down
neck
 She is extremely useful
 Among other things yeah
seen and I grew up in Shadycreek Run
 Scared straight
the road
 I have a potion I start to look to see what
Jesters got inside the haversack other than the
dodecahedron and our tent
 She had a Heroes Feast in there I think
 Caleb comes up behind
 Hold on Here theres the dodecahedron
 Made by gnomes
 I have a dagger Here use mine
 I shoot out the globules of light to float
around the corpse
 Its very bright Super bright
 You can do this and I walk twenty feet
back
 Youre far more dexterous than I
 Are you dexterous
 Show us

 Id say she earned one yeah
 Short rest you said Sorry was reading my
book
 Im sorry did we get any horses Just
enough to fit us all on condensed right
 I think we should continue to make time as
well
 As they leave Caleb scooches Frumpkin on
about you but I do not
 Off inside I think
 I will
 I will begin it by putting out the silver
thread around the group
 Individual
 Because I cant decide
 Better than my 
 How far away
 Uh
 I would send one of two things One is our
little friend here or
 Or I lose the peregrine and go back to
something else a little less noticeable
 And its dark out now yeah
  I would know if an owl Owls can
see in the dark
 Yeah okay Okay Im going to change
Frumpkin again out of peregrine into an owl I
will mark that off on my supplies Ive got one
more after this that I can do
 And uh No I mean I need incense but
anyway
 Yeah I send Frumpkin tree to tree in that
direction Maybe  feet and wait a moment and
then another  feet
 With disadvantage
 Okay Perception you said 
 Knees to chest
 Okay She is paying him no mind at the
moment
 I whisper in fragments what I saw through
Frumpkins eyes the whole time but Im still
looking and I cant hear anybody
 Oh right I would be holding onto Molly
This is reminding me of stories that my mother
told me when I was very young Not good ones
things to scare me into following the rules I
come out of it
 And a woman or not
 Quickly Have to think here because
everyone else is sleeping and that didnt look
good for that little boy but then it doesnt
really help us with what we are doing but then
the child What to do
 I go back into Frumpkin to see whats going
on
 I swat at Molly and say
 Wake the others
 Im not sure but I think there is a young
child thats in danger there We seemed to care
about the bird child maybe we care about this
one I dont know
 We got to act right now
 She looked dead She did not look natural
 A short rest I thought we did back at the
house
 I happily went I get to use arcane
recovery in my head because of the conversation
that was happening
 Thank you Matt
 I wanted to go with Nott about  feet
behind and cast Mage Armor as I go
 It is a big ten
 You did this last time Youre not human
 You cant come back
 Ooh thats craziness
 Same
 I like it It feels like I am looking at the
paper
 Its customizable I havent customized mine
yet
 Always
 Yes Keg we are
  We were going to camp back there
but instead we are going to camp over there
  At least
 Its just the five Neins
You dont want anything out of this
 Do you understand what I am saying Do you
speak Is his ward awake
 I bring Frumpkin without saying a word
telepathically I have Frumpkin come down in front
of the child and do a little owl nonsensical
shimmy dance on the ground just for ten seconds
to catch his attention then have Frumpkin flutter
up and land on his head and gently find purchase
and sit
 I smile
 Mollymauk will take that
 Only sometimes
 Thank you both
 Well Dark business at hand
 They all know each other
 Do you know a goblin named Furgle Burgle
 That is the best you ever did
 As we leave Frumpkins head does that crazy
owl thing that goes  and flips around and just
looks as
 We are wellrested
 Now all of us know ooh I went Vax All of
us know what you already knew which is yes
still hurts that these people are terrible And
deserve no mercy
 What do you think
 Oh you know If we can Were not
altruistic by nature either
 But lets be clear were going to eliminate
the problem
 Save our friends And if we can do something
extra we do something extra When we can
 All right lets run these bastards down
ja
 Or a wizard who can read anything
 I am
 So advantage minus five on both
 Okay thats not good thats a one Okay
that means I got a seven
 At advantage minus five on both the rolls I
rolled a nine and a one So hey
 If we do the one more hour its constitution
checks
 Im sharp I should always do this
 Same
 Yes one more We push it one more hour
 Fast equals a constitution check right
 Natural  I dont want to hear it
 Eight
 Sweet this is my first What happens to me
Do I die on the spot
 Thats my secret Taliesin Im always
hangry
 Eight hours and you said the eight hours
was
 Yeah theres a way to do that
 We could push it too Im good
 Okay Five minute little flyahead
 I hold on to my horse and stop hearing
everybody Disadvantage
 Its terrible Its perception was that
what I was doing Five
 Its getting dark out here and Im tired
 Before I go to sleep I do the silver
thread
 
 You played yourself
 Ill take this myself
 Good Frumpkin got Im going to use my cat
stats because I dont have owl stats handy
 Oh okay good
stats
 Eleven
 Thirteen
 Okay so sitting in the silence are any of
these people awake that I can tell
 Look at the lot of you Look at these
people
I should go right now I dont know you at
all Look at this one Hes like a walking
rainbow what is this Why are you with him It
makes no sense Hes a circus performer hes not
going to help you This one you told everything
to to try to get into a library You learned
nothing On your gamble you failed Youre
stupid Smart as you are youre stupid with this
She could cave in everything This three that have
Ones weird One of them tried to kill you The
other one shes adorable but Stupid This one
here What do you expect to do with her How is
she going to help you do what you want to do She
can watch your back
 I know Dont worry youre fine Shes as
much a liability as anything else You know youre
fucking mad when youre gesticulating this much
You should just go You have told too much I am
going to go Its time to go He sits there for a
solid five minutes Then two hours Wait for
everyone to wake up
 She can do it on the road
 You should do that Arnold monologue from
that documentary  You know
when I am with my I am coming And then when Im
working out I am coming always
 Bigger than averagesized man you mean
looking He might have a halfelf with him
 Well were about to get into it yeah
 Ill tell you what I do is I dab my thumb
into my belt for a bit of sweet oil and I rub it
on my bottom lip and mutter an arcane word or two
been holding back about these people so that we
are fully prepared That is a Suggestion spell
 No
 It was details that would help us in the
situation
 Youre compelled to say anything thats
useful in what were about to do with these
people
 Any other details that youve been holding
back that would help us in this situation
 No magic
 The ones with the arcane ability look like
that are magical
 What color is the halfelfs hair
 That is a pretty big matzo ball
 I take people at their word
 Yeah lay low
 I plant my hand on Notts head and go into
Frumpkins eyesight and send him up there
 Advantage you say
 Yeah Owl rolls yeah 
 All but Lorenzo
 Its good Its true shaved head The wind
its good
 Sure this time he does
 Sometimes I do lately
 This is our best chance because we dont
want them to get to their destination because then
they are surrounded by many friends
 Yeah Now is the time
 That is wicked
 No wait until they sleep Were going to
follow at a distance and then when they bed down
for the night we leave and then skirt around
 I like this
 Well done Nott well done
 Of course you can This is why I say you
shouldnt just hand it over Just save it for the
moment
 Six
 Better constitution than Vax though
 One hour in  minutes
 I would recommend they will probably be
traveling pretty close together and I could slow
them down Magically speaking If you were to bait
them a bit and talk to them
Then if we pick a trigger point I could cast
Slow most of them some of them would make it
through unscathed but
 What does that have to do with the dawn
 We have acid
 Dispel Magic
 How would that what
 Yes I can but what does that have to do
with the cart
 We may have a split second to you want to
try to get these people out immediately thats
what youre saying
 It was two carts you said
 I couldnt tell from the aerial view which
one theyre all hidden right
 That is a good giveaway though
 The best thing that I could do in that
department is Slow hopefully all of them down
All of them if they are closely grouped If not
I could hold one person
 We could but the way I would do that would
be with a giant earthen cat paw which would seem
out of the ordinary
 On a muddy road probably not very useful
 I am not going to destroy three horses in
one shot
 I thought we talked about horses as well
 They come upon a tree and somebody
 They come upon a tree in the road and a
woman that they despise now and that is not
suspicious because
 I am not demanding anything but my counter
proposal is that I walk  yards back along the
road put the silver thread across the road so we
know they are coming spend a few hours hiding
ourselves at the tops of these hills waiting
Nobody is in the road
 We wait until they are just below us I cast
Slow on them and then we murder them
 Well unless we hear a feasible plan for
doing that first
 I say we kick them in the goolies as hard as
we can from the beginning
 Actually I mean that is a good idea Could
we spend an Im going to go set my thread across
the road Could you make hiding places for all of
us Nott
I have seen both of you vanish so if you put
in a little bit of time and elbow grease you can
either find places on these two hills that are
conducive to us hiding or create those situations
with grass or something I dont know how to do
it
 Im going to tell Frumpkin to go in the sky
and watch and head up the road a ways to set that alarm
 If he were human Sam
 As Caleb comes back from setting the Alarm
spell tell me what you have worked out so far I
set the Alarm spell and I took a wee over that
way
 Thats great
 I think that we dont want to gild the lily
That log is good
 and it makes
 If you come to a road and theres trees
along it your dander goes up Youre on guard
 Yeah Im in favor of that
 You can stick a branch in there
 And Notts trap making skills for help
 I am going to be way ahead behind these
bushes because what Im going to contribute I can
do from far away and I can be knocked down like
that so
 Im going to have to improvise If they can
all be clumped together for the best but Im
going to wait and Im going to call it in the
moment if theres two together and not three I
will go for two If all three are together great
 Oh I thought they were coming from the
other direction
 The horses will slow the people will slow
 And a row of carts though not a group
 It will make for a train which will not get
them all within what I need Maybe two of them
 Theyre still on a road theyre still
probably going to go well The risk of a straight
line of them
fit in that space
 It is a foot cube
 Maybe Its dicey Its right on the cusp
probably for two or three Two is better than
none slowed down
 Thats great but theyre still in a line
 Thats awesome excuse me that is fucking
wunderbar That is wunderbar if they were all
clumped together but Im going to give it a 
chance of them being in a line
 That is true If theyre in a train we wait
for cart number two to be in that bottleneck and
then I try to get the first two The third ones
not going to go anywhere What were losing is
the more of these assholes who you used to be a
part of are its not just the carts its them
They can do less to us if I hit them But you
know its not perfect Theres no perfect situation
 Yeah
bottleneck is when we should go
 Oh that is a lot of fun
 Ja on the first one
 Thank you Mr Sheen
 Correct
 No it wont ruin my books its just I would
only be able to use it this one time then its gone
 Do you have any paper Yeah It would be
gone either way
  No I mean I do have a very
nearperfect memory
 Nearperfect
 Yeah
 But theres no Slow if theres Invisibility
Oh but its a scroll
 Im popping out of my German accent If I
cast a concentration spell and then I use a
scroll does it drop the concentration check on
 I think Slow is more beneficial than
Invisibility
 When they cross the finish line Ive set a
silver thread across the road and if they move
through that Anyone but us who walks through that
line will set it off and I will hear
 No no no Its in here
 I wanted to do
 No I wanted to do more than that Lets say
 yards
 No I am in favor of Slow over Invisibility
I want to kill them
 Sorry
 To confirm step one is tree goes down on
cart one if its that way right Slow happens
you can get a sneak attack in if its an ambush
 And everyone else is going to start
whaling
 And that was a blonde pixie cut and a
halforc A bald halforc
 Sure I can dispel any magical stuff going
on in the cages shortly after or improvise and
switch to long range destruction
 Ja the plan will fuck up Im sure but we
will scrap through or die Rather than choose who
were going to attack in the moment I saw through
my owl the halforc with his hood down is a bald
man I would say lets look for that one first
 Thats Liam not Caleb Everyone else was
hooded so we dont know
 I would say then that whichever one reveals
them first either halforc or woman with a
pixie cut whoever reveals themself first well
say that is the one that we all target at the same
time We focus our attention to one and kill them
and they are out of the picture instead of
splitting between two
 Ja but if they dont reveal themselves
first
 Correct Thats wise
 Probably Mollymauk
 Up up
 Its totally whippets
 No every time its magical and very
special
 Anytime Caleb does it he sees all
timelines but in the interest of brevity
 Understood
 In advance you mean
 Yes Vax die yes
 
 That was my trigger
 Slow and I will target these four assholes
right here I think I can get in one go probably
foot cube
 Roll again
 Miss the Percy megainitiative
 
 Ja vierzehn
 Evil party evil party
 Indeed I am Molasses goes across my hand
and I draw my hand down through the air and I
focus on these four if I can Its a foot
cube putting this one in a corner
 Up to six in a foot cube
 All of them
 Well you know fuck it Lets also get this
horse
 Oh theres six of them Oh wow yes
 Yes never mind I didnt think we were
getting all of those people Good All of the humanoids
 Half speed negative two to armor class no
reactions and they can either do an action or a
bonus action they cant do both
 They can attempt to cast a spell but
 Your charisma Sam Your charisma
 Nope
 If you attempt to cast a spell with a
casting time of one action
 Right
 Read the cards people Read the cards
 Knew where I was My stealth was that
shitty
 Im going to die Its fine
 Vorugal was the frost Umbrasyl was black
acid
 Slowed
 Oh he saved
 Hes casting
 Slash the best
 Were back to me
 I cast Dispel Magic on the cages or I could
attack the person about to attack me
 Thats what I would do I will use the Glove
of Blasting to fire on the person attacking me
 The one on the hill
 Yeah
 Yeah three of those
 First one does not hit that is a 
 Second is Sorry 
 Oh it was  on the last one Does that
hit
 Thank you The third one definitely misses
Thats a two plus eight thats ten
 d
 Not that great Ten damage fire damage
They have to make a constitution save
 Oh they were casting an attack Well I
dont know what they were casting
 Yeah theyre fine
 I will lie down flat on my back
 Shield It doesnt hit
 Its Sams raison dtre
disadvantage on everything Im going to try to do
this turn because seeing Lorenzo again I think
has really freaked Keg out
 But you said everythings at disadvantage
 Get the nerves out Get the nervousness
out
 That is huge
 I dont know Thats your call
 Thats why I go far away
 No I dont mind at all
 I rolled a 
 Now youre mounted
 Hes right there
 Burned it Burn that shit
 Im going to hold my turn and cast a
Scorching Ray at the sorcerer the moment they do
anything First I will get up off of prone into
a crouch
 The moment she does anything That depends
on how you want to interpret that
 Well I meant do anything I guess do
anything to hurt us
 Isnt one of them encased in ice
 You have destroyed the show
 Yeah bad shit happens
 Bad shit happens to mediocre people
 Not with what we got
 Okay Im going to give us about ten minutes
to figure out what we want to do here and then I
am sending Frumpkin out after them We need to
decide something now because I am going to be out
of it for a bit
 Beauregard she would have told us She
wouldnt have been able to hide it
 I pull Keg up This place they are going is
it permanent Or a temporary camp or its been
there for years and this where they always are
 Do you know how far off we are from it now
 How many people are in their camp what did
you call it
have camp
 Yeah
city
 Sure What about The Sour Nest
know who those other two were I dont fucking
know Everything that I thought I knew about
them I dont know
 What do we want to do
 That is what Im talking about Mollymauk is
dead Three are not not yet and we have invested
a lot of time into forging this alliance we are
in Nott Im not proposing a headtohead
confrontation Maybe I want to know where they
are I want to know what conditions theyre in
Im not willing to walk away from this
 We could live sure we could live We go
hide in the woods Go back to picking pockets and
pulling scams on people You know that I want more
than that
 What are we going to do first The man
crawled out of a grave once if hes to be believed
 Hes done it once maybe he will do it
again Do we stay here do we try to find I
dont Ive read of miracles
your friends The ones that are captured
 A note
 How many days travel are we from the
beginning of this journey
 Yeah From The Gentleman
 We are in the middle of nowhere
 You can get us there though
 It does not need to be a frontal assault we
dont need to throw our lives away
 I pull out the clay cats paw and cast
Earthen Grasp and the cats claw forms out of the
dirt and I use it to start digging a hole in the
earth
 Yeah As the cats claw starts digging down
Im looking for the glaive wasnt left right
He took it with him
 Sticks branches ja
 No I go to Mollys body and begin to get
the coat off him
 The claw has about a minute so hopefully it
can dig something deep enough
 Okay Im going to start to pull him into
the hole
 I grab some paper out of my bag and I start
writing a note to Mollymauk telling him to find
us through The Gentleman
 I take that note and I stick it into the
lapel of the folds of his clothes and I brush the
hair out of his face and then I start to push
soil back over the body
 Shine bright circus man
 Caleb sighs and takes a fivefoot sixfoot
sturdy branch one that could be a walking stick
and I take that stone that lucky rock that I
found and I start to hammer the branch into the
ground so it is sticking up like a post and then
hang Mollymauks coat from it
 Not right away If he comes up out of the
ground it will be here waiting for him in a day
or two
 I think we will just leave the coat
Beauregard
 Well we do not have to decide what we are
going to do right away We could have an
opportunity grab our friends We dont need to
rush into the lions den Lets see what we are
looking at what we are dealing with We get our
three friends back We have not traveled with them
this far to throw it away
 Their deaths would be a waste
 Caleb storms off into the woods
 Im in the open right now with the horses
yeah
 The horse is Theres no person around
 I walk up to the front of the horse
 Oh Who are you Freund
 Hi welcome
 Hey thats a pretty good trick
 Youre out for a stroll
 Oh gut How long have you You are very
tall
 Ja Okay Did you see everything that
happened in here in the last  minutes or so
 Hey guys we have a visitor
 Um
 Yes I just was not expe you know weve
been through Its been a long day
 You dont have any holy abilities by any
chance
have abilities which I might like to share with you
 Well if youve been watching we have just
buried a friend of ours maybe we were premature
Should we go dig him up
 Thats a stupid question from me I
apologize
 She probably would have offered though you
know
 Ja how are you feeling about your chances
now after watching the bloodbath
can help but I knew I could not do it alone and
I saw you have abilities too
 She was a horse a moment ago

talks to himself
 It is a little trick Can you turn yourself
into anything dangerous
crocodile
 Have you ever been in a fight
be able to use to help Theres one in particular
that I want to use against these evil people
 Hey over there is a tree stump on the side
of the road Thats the bald one What do you do
 That sounds good
 What time of the day is it
 The fight was in the early morning
 Right okay
 Can I borrow your flask please
 How old is your boy
 Horse nap
 I send Frumpkin up into the air as an owl
 Yes
 Im pulling the first of the three off the
road to the side
 Are you able to do just one person
 Could you do the whole group
 Weve taken everything yeah
vision
 Ugh
youll have more room
 Weregoats
 You and me goblina
 Sam youre bonier than Gollum
 
 Hearty German living
 Youre like the little kid in A Christmas
Story I cant put my arms down
 I kick my horse along
 Rewind the tape just a little bit
 We were going at a pretty good pace there
few feet right before we would have all seen the
gate Youre welcome You know Im really earning
my keep here So
 Yeah We could just take everything off our
horses and gather it
 Yeah
 We lie you over the horse and we put a bunch
of shit on top of you yeah
 Then you are going to do some sort of horse
magic that makes us sorry Im unclear
Invisible or
 You cannot
 But what you can do its still useful
here
 If the people who are hiding try to look
like covered in cloth and shit and try to look
like cloth
 You can make it more believable
 This whole pow wow was happening around the
bend
though
 No we keep going for a while
 Keep up appearances Yeah Youre going
carry these two Theyre both going to lie on top
of your horseback
heavy
 Too heavy
 Shes like all sticks though
 She could be on our horse
 Because you and I are skin and bones
Trace
 Ja I mutter a few words and suddenly look
like an old coot with a band of hair around the
sides and my jaw is off to the side a bit and its
missing a few teeth and very squinty Thats me
 Yeah thats it
 Stop the game Whats the drawing Hold it
up
 Lets see
 Somebody was talking having a moment Then
you draw a dick man
 Rissa and Robert Duvall
 Shut the fuck up
 Yes we have that
 Oh yeah Okay
 Do you have any place where we can lay up
There is this place called the Plaza Emporium A
pleasant but can be murderous dragonborn runs
that Shes not affiliated with any of the
unseemly folks directly so shes a bit more
neutral We might be able to get information from her
 Does she murder everybody or does
best behavior The Landlocked Lady is a brothel
We might want to cover Nilas eyes Its run by
the Marduns who happen to be
 That is correct
 Are you still laying across the back of a
horse or have you pulled yourself up
myself

 Of course
 
 In Zadash it would look like shit but here
its the belle of the ball
 Are they altruists though or are they
mercenaries
forgot about them because we always thought they
were nerds But now Im trying to be a little bit
better They might be helpful
 
 Keg if we find an alleyway to drop you out
of sight of you suddenly appearing can you walk
around this town or is that dangerous
place called The Trench that the Iron Shepherds in
this area always hang out in
 How stupid is it for you to walk up on open
road in this place
be
 Ja one second though Which way from
here are these Iron Chefs located
Nest is
 Two hours travel
 Okay In that direction
 Can you describe to me what it looks like
Is it noticeable
 No I do not want to go up there now I was
thinking of maybe sending my cat but that can
wait Lets go into this place
 Sitaritic
 This is what she does in brothels
 You have had a lot of luck predicting things
with this stink pouch
may smell it if you wish
 What do I smell
 Oh thats pretty good 
 Oh well yes Im convinced We should
definitely just march up to the estate
well
others
 Well perhaps we dont want to show up on
these peoples doorstep as the sun is going down
Why dont we spend a night here You were looking
for some companionship You can work on that
 Sure we can talk to the clientele Maybe
you should hang back
 How do you mean
 Yeah thats outside of the city into the
woods
 Yeah I think so Weve been traveling all
day We stay here we get up We dont know
anything about where the Shepherds We know
nothing about their stronghold just what youre
able to tell us but that doesnt tell us how many
people are there now what we are going to be up
against We talk to the Marduns tomorrow figure
out the next step from there
 No we have been together a long time so
were used to
 Sure
 I dont know if that was called for at all
 Shush This one and myself will take one
room
 I will handle the two gold for Nott and
myself
 Oh boy
 Sure Im good
occasional tongueeating is mostly what I was
referring to
 You know maybe quit while youre ahead
Nott come on lets go upstairs
 No something else Youre good Go on get
it on
 Youre probably nailing a yearold
 Welcome to Deadwood
 Before going down with Nott and Caleb I
minute okay
 I dont care about Keg or any of that I
want to talk about what you and I are doing
 I was this close to running off from that
road when things turned on us You and I we are
going to survive together That is the main
thing
 The dwarf stepped up  Changed my
mind like that
 Whatever she said to him he left
 Yeah
 But we have done a lot and you know what I
am about
 So I just want you and I you and me
especially to be on the same page because we have
been for months now ja You are my friend I
want you to be with me and I want us to live We
have done a lot with these people and if we can
finesse this and do it in a way that does not
throw our lives in the fire there is more to be
achieved We will help you get to where you want
to get and myself together We will work
together with these people
 Yes
 I like them
 We are not hiding anymore Well not like we
used to There is a certain amount of risk to what
we are doing And what I want is good for more
people than just me
 Well we are about to risk our lives to pull
three people we met four or five weeks ago out of
the hands of a lot of dangerous people Seems like
a pretty good offer for them
 I dont have any family youre the closest
thing that I have I have come to rely on you and
I am grateful for your company
 Well lets screw our courage to the
sticking place and get them out of there
 He would get more defensive with time I
dont know We dont know enough I would like to
find out where he sleeps
 Headon I agree not a good idea We will
take a roundabout way Lets figure out what were
talking about first
 I invite her in
 I dont even say anything just a firm hug
Lets go down
 Sex bacon

  We are going to go and meet
the Marduns
 We are going to ask for Ophelia Mardun
 Maybe
 Oh Not right now but when we are ja
 Its very enigmatic but we will okay
 Where are your s Ashly where are your
s
 Well let you know if we find them Come
on
 Where does he get such wonderful toys
 There is a difference between Crownsguard
and Empire soldiers Is one higher than the other
 Yeah I dont think weve ever discussed
this but is Calebs father Crownsguard or Empire
 Which is below both of those
 Okay
 Well youre not familiar with this where
you are from
 Roll one of your buddies
 
 Sniff nuts
  giant shitty rooster
 Shes an Iron Shepherd kill her
 Would you like to ask it what is dangerous
in the wood
 Three days
 Ja That is not a problem Hello
 Ja We are good here
 We have been traveling a great distance We
are here to speak if you dont mind we have a
message for Ophelia Mardun It can only be heard
by her We have been charged with this message and
no funny business I hope that we could impart our
message and be done
 Would you tell her that a very refined
gentleman from the south would like to pass his
regards to her
 Ja 
 Not very good at all
 It is a long way
 Yeah Only a fool travels alone
 Im just smiling at the guards
 
 We are all going to laugh about this later
I promise 
 We are good
 That is correct ja
 Well we will be plain He has sent us He
has told us that you are in need of assistance
and he has deemed us worthy to provide it
  Not very much
 Fireball

 Am I right
 Its like I can be on the shitter if I
want to check
 Calebs spells
 I can be mid dook
 Mid dook and check my spells
 One more time please
 Your accent is thick
 No I appreciate hearing the old tongue
again
 Some of us are trained killers for sure and
we have picked up help as we have seen fit
Everyone has been carefully selected carefully
vetted Im sure that with your input on their
mannerisms and habits their routines we will do
quite well
 We have come a long way Is there any You
know them better than us were outoftowners
Any tips to specifically deal with your problem
 There we go
 Yeah this is a preexisting arrangement
thats outside of negotiation at the moment I
understand We will take care of what you are
asking
 Zemnian
 Were left with guards
 All right good fellows would you escort us
out and point us in the right direction
 Did I see any books on the way out
 
 Fuck this podunk town
 You know where you are
 Yeah Lets put a little distance between
ourselves and this place and this gentleman and I
will send Frumpkin out to have a look
 While you look I will say an important
point for clarification Once we are out of the
view of this gentleman guarding the secret
entrance Caleb walking with poise up to a tree
leans against it bends down and has a panic
attack
 Stop it I am nauseous Lets go kill a
bunch of people
 That is sour
 Lets go
 Member
 Member clerics
 Four
 Yeah
 You said yesterday that you were a horse
first and then you said you could only do it one
more time or a certain number of times correct
I rested
 If you were to become say a raccoon right
now and go running around that is one time that
you cannot become a crocodile to eat somebodys
face off
face off
 Okay I think let us reserve that for now
because Frumpkin can do the job Lets get closer
to this place and it would only take five minutes
He will go
 Yeah
 I mean I could turn him back into a cat
but then hes slower he cant get over the walls maybe
 How far have we traveled at this point
 Unless you roll high
 Nope
 Ducks you guys Its ducks
 Ja okay thats easy I sit down on the
ground and send Frumpkin into the air
  There is a very large black
bear ahead of us with bones coming out of its
butt and stuff and it has just laid down for a
nap
 What are we going to do
 
 You guys Taliesins a bear

 How dense is the forest around this place
 Theres no manicured open place around
Its just nestled among trees around it or
 Our lot is hidden in the trees a ways
away
 This is where we send an owl
 Im going to send him and its going to take
a moment I want him to go around the entire place
and keep an eye on it and watch it Maybe  or 
minutes Are we good with that
 How will we You and I could talk to the
mouse
 Well for now this is easy were going to
send my owl now If anything goes wrong will you
please tap three times on my left knee I go blind
and send Frumpkin up
 I tell him telepathically to just chill and
sit there for a while
 Perception you say 
 How many people do I see down inside
 Total two up top
 They definitely dont know any ice magic
magic Definitely Is it accurate to say that if
we were to find Grudge Gang members that were
unaffiliated that we could pay them
 Did you say how big the structure within the
wall is
 They find a dead man on their perimeter and
know that someone is fucking with them
 They could be inside This is not any better
than our chances on the road
 Looking through Frumpkins eyes was I able
to see the entrance through this wall that the
guards are up top on Whats the way in here
 No gate or doorway at all
 Solid
 None of this
 How do you get out if you are in a mouse
 The gates are solid
 Thats why I asked
 Possible
 Could you make yourself a very distinct
looking mouse like a shock of white hair on the
mouse head or something like that Something
unique
 Correct
mouse
 Send in the animals
 Would Comprehend Languages work with a
mouse or no That would be a different spell
right Speak with Animals
 I agree yeah
Im going to hold it together and I will come out Right
 Yeah KIT Keep it together
 You must know Jareth the Goblin King Youre
buddies with him
 Truth
 Ja but we didnt talk about the first
part Frumpkins got to bring her in there Buddy
dont eat just carry her Stay away from the two
on the top okay Put her by the barrels if you
can Then come back
 As hes going I tell him
 Correction find
an out of the way place to sit and watch those
barrels Stealth you say
 For my owl so I have to go to the other
page The owl page
 Which I have ready
 
 Take your shot
 Does not hit my owl
 You hear beside you
 Arschloch
 Of the building
 POV two inches tall
 This floor upstairs or downstairs
 Squeakers
 After a while yeah
 Thats a 
 What was
 Thats true
 Did you learn anything
saw my son I know where they are keeping people
I know where they are keeping their prisoners
There is a trap door You can get through it
through a mess hall and through another room and a
hallway There are two Iron Shepherds eating in
the mess hall There are I think many under the
trap door
 Many
big bed The big bed belongs to the leader
your son
was him but it looked like he was eating
 One of these in the mess hall
something that didnt look like an animal It
looked small
 How many people You said two
voices under the trap door I know theyre there
My son is not dead He is there underneath the
trap door
 I pull some paper out and say Can you draw
these rooms
 Thats cool
 Yeah
 Well I like the idea of an extra hand or
two to back us up but I also agree with you We
go in at night and try to take the guards out who are
watching quietly hopefully If that is the case
we can go in and get our friends and if we do
that successfully then we can burn these ones in
their sleep
 Write what you know
 Good game
 Yeah and we dont have all the time in the
world because we are trying to intervene before
the worst happens
 Do we get a sense of the Taskers are they
just a group like us Like a small group or we
dont know yet
 Then we are not fulfilling our
responsibilities
without killing them
 We go at night and the first step is taking
care of the two there could be more but two that
we saw on the wall whoever is on the wall at
night silently Then from all youve told us we
have this might be incomplete information but
three There is the shithead himself and then two you saw
 So three total that we know about
 That is also correct
 When you were in this house as a mouse
there was no way down there It was a solid trap
door You dont know what was under it
thing that I could see
 What did you hear specifically
trying to listen for my partner and my son I know
they were the voices of the captured people the
prisoners I believe I heard voices as well of
some of the murderers
 Well we need to peel this like an onion We
need to I believe get some help Get some
reassurance Outer layer of the onion is making
sure we take whoever is on the walls whoever is
keeping watch out silently so that we can begin
anew with the building itself I think that either
you or my friend here should go in ahead of us so
we have some idea of what is happening Once in a
while I turn this one into a spider It is slow
but it is very undetectable
 Do you feel differently
 Truthfully there are ways that I can hurt
people with a spider but Im just talking about
having a look around so that we are not walking
into something different than what you saw last night
 Well I disagree with you
 Agree to disagree
smoke break
 You are new This is very typical Its just
part of the group dynamic We are all friends
 I am a master debater
 But we want to take numbers down so we peel
the outer layer separately If all goes well then
there is whoever is upstairs The big X factor is
what is what is beneath We dont know how many
people are underneath
 If I can find materials in Shadycreek I
need gold dust a lot of gold dust How likely is
that here
be the general store would that have that
 To first get gold dust I would need gold
 How much do we have I have next to
nothing
 What about in the haversack Does Jester
have any funds in there
 Text thread explodes in five four three
 Remember LIAM EATS FARTS
 Yeah it could be a group effort I feel
very confident for many of our skills for the ones
on the outside What Im concerned about is
entering the front door What is behind What I
would like to do is go when they are sleeping and
hopefully murder them in their sleep is the best case
dont we make them come outside We have more
abilities outside
 Yeah the thing when someone is sleeping in
a bed is they are like little  I was
going to say babies I shouldnt say that
 Theres a little bit that we have to play
this by ear I think we should go at night to
handle things when it is the least busy
 Well maybe we can find some in Shadycreek
 One
 That seems strangely specific
 Than an onion Well how about were just
going to kill the people on the wall how is that
for a metaphor
 I like the idea of someone with a little bit
of muscle and then another person who is adept at
healing injuries
 In the woods
 Did Ophelia mention how far out into the
woods that person was
 It is the same day
 Ja that is a good point
 Yeah friendsies
a healer
 Well were weighing two things against each
other One is expediency because there are many
people in Shadycreek who could possibly lend a
sword or ability But I think that you are
correct That there is no telling their
allegiance and Im not ruling them out but this
pocket of our enemies We need to come to a
decision promptly
state of your companions is
 Or wrapped them around her finger one way
or the other No they are actually pretty
theyve got their shit together
 A child
 Yes
 We have to make a decision
  Ophelia Mardun

 To the household ja If we find what we
find in the woods is helpful enough and we feel
good with what we got Then in the middle of the
night is a go
 We want to hit it at two or three in the
morning
 Whatever makes you feel comfortable
has special abilities for reviving the dead and
healing people
 You cannot argue with that
 Yeah
 Are we Prancercising
 Oh also are our horses dead
 But it wouldnt speed us up because its
the woods
 Lets walk
 I will walk just behind Nila
 Shes just the biggest Im going to stand
next to the biggest person
 Get it girl
 Is there anything to add to ooh
 One moment I send Frumpkin up to flit about
 feet ahead to see if there is anything ahead
or from a birds eye view that we are unable to
detect
 That is a 
 Frumpkin is how far from me at this point
 So I can only watch I have muttered all
this watching We are talking concentric rings
 Ja
 I am beginning to think this a little more
than we came looking for but we have traveled a ways
 We are going on a witch hunt We cant go
over it we cant go under it
 Caleb starts to climb over
 
 Nobody was aware I was panicked the whole
time The thorns are almost like small razors
 Careful
 How far away is the structure
 Domo arigato
 Hold on
 Caleb tries to creep up to a gravestone and
hide behind it to get within  feet of the door
 Nine
 Youre really just a random shopkeep in the
woods
 You dont say
 Does he seem like hes going to kill us
 Thank you 
 Neinteen
 I come over and sit and take one of the
teas
 Oh well Herr Clay we come to you with a
great tragedy
 Do you want to or should I
 Thats the first one
  Do we really have time for a
comedy bit like this
 How long have you been alone out here
 How many seasons has it been since someone
has knocked on your door like we have
 That is a very fair point
 We are very random visitors from out of the
blue We do come to you with tragedy We do have a
friend in the ground We do have friends who are
in dire need of assistance You help people into
the ground but offhand do you help them out of
the ground
 Weve all read stories of the extraordinary
but you do not have this in your wheelhouse you
are saying
 Three in the cage is worth one in the dirt
that need help
 We are not bad guys
 If you are saying that you are able to help
people back from the brink of extinction on
occasion or under the right circumstances I am
going to hazard a guess that you could heal a
wound in a snap yeah
 Now its just you
 Well youre double lucky
 Herr Clay we are dealing with a
timesensitive situation You are looking for a
segue out of this predicament youre in
 Herr Clay we should be very honest with
you We are intending to do good by people who
deserve it A young one Good people But we are
going to do very difficult business tonight or tomorrow
 Welcome to The Mighty Nein
 Do you require anything
 Youll have it
 Youll have it
 Motherfucking druid
  Well figure that out
 So Let me tell you about the murderers we
are dealing with
 First there was the dinosaurs

 So only one hit point
 We didnt really discuss we got
distracted
 We are going to find somebody spur of the
moment tell them to come with us out to the
woods To do a bit of dark business
 No I dont know if thats a good idea I
dont like our options at the moment any of them
really I feel like we dont have we are one
more person than when we got our asses handed to
us on the road and we thought we had the upper
hand then Now we have one more that is better
but if we go to the town and we find a couple of
neerdowells wholl work for coin we are
convincing them to come with us right away into
the woods Into the woods
 What do you think
 If we do that the three of us would do the
talking naturally
 Well we could take them at night which we
did not do before Some of them would be awake
probably not all of them We had the element of
surprise before we hopefully have it now
 Home turf is big
 You know Nott I agree with you The most
important thing is getting the people who are in
that basement The most important thing Youve
always got to improvise
 The only thing that I believe is known is
taking care of the people on that wall anyone
outside I will send Frumpkin around to see if
there are more than just these two then we will
have decisions to make We will need to send in
Frumpkin again or our new friend here One of us
one of them and make a plan from there That is
all we know now We need to do something and I
feel a little on edge with our numbers but I am
maybe more on edge by the ticking clock
 But what is it that lures the Shepherds out
of their hole
 That will put them in the courtyard it will
not probably put them in the woods
 True
 Ten
 I think we might be doing this now so be
prepared for it
could we pretend it was Frumpkin if he shoots out
or something
 Frumpkin shoots up into the air and bounces
off a tree
 I have an owl here it is That hits
 Frumpkin is alive
 Well its d plus one and I rolled it
last time and I rolled a four so its d plus one
 I told him to go down low to the ground
Yeah
 Ja I can but I poof into Frumpkins
senses Do I hear anything besides Phil and
Mystery Man
 Ja because of the hearing
 Oh thats good on the first roll The first
roll is good so it is 
 Whos in the building
 Okay I snap my fingers and Frumpkin
vanishes leaving the bolt where he was and then
I do it again Hes here
 May I borrow one of your goodberries
 Is this one Okay
or five left
 I will take four
 One two three four You may keep that
one Thank you
 We could potentially keep moving now if we
want to because
 Yeah we know theres two on the wall maybe
thats their MO every night theres two on the
walls People are awake inside What is the hour
right now
 
 yeah
 Yeah it is
 Oh Im sorry 
 now
 Yeah approximately
 Its still 

 Im not going to do this right now We have
a decision to make Doesnt seem any better or
worse from the outside but we are outside the
onion Are we going back to town to get a little
more muscle or are we making a go of it here
 Well how successfully could we silently
kill these two on the wall You would be good at one
 But pitch it to me How You I know
 Yeah but we have to finish the job
instantly
 Could also shoot him from the dark when hes
not expecting it to happen
 No the people inside will hear it No we
need silence
say something
 No its too early We need to wait
 Its 
 at night We need to wait until
theyre asleep
 No
 How far is Beauregard from me right now
 Did you wander away from me
  Would you rather wait until they
are sleeping in their beds before we did this
 I dont want this one moving along right
now She makes a lot of noise
 If we are doing this I feel we should wait
until it is late at night and wait until we see
those guards changed and then wait a little bit
further for the old guards to go to sleep Yeah
So theres a lot of sitting here and not moving I
know we are all very anxious but we wait someone
comes out relieves these two they go to bed and
then we strike all at once Then we do your plan
its just delayed thats all
 Yeah but Keg you stay here
 Wait
 Yeah you are just waiting until some of us
are able to silently take out these people on the
wall Then we buy ourselves a little time while
you can clink and clunk as we get closer
 Its good that you find levity in the
situation Then we go into the inside of this wall
and take the next step
two
 Well its two groups and you move less
right now
 Thank goodness I have to pee so bad
 Lets go back to town
  Elmosdaddy
voice
  
  Everybodys going to die
 Hes got a little board under there
 In the interim while were waiting for that
to happen Im going to do two things One Im
going to cast Mage Armor on myself and Im also
going to pull a book out of one of the holsters
and spend ten minutes changing Frumpkin into a
spider
 He has three hit points so I think hes
actually a bigger spider than the one youre
imagining See hes right there Hes very big
 Its three hit points worth of spider
 Somebody could step on it and he could still
go
 Get Brian Foster in here with his ping pong
racket
 I put it on Beaus shoulder
 I pull the haversack off and say
 I have a
decent idea anyway I think that you should use this
 Back to my idea okay Nott on the other
side can probably put a bolt in that guys throat
over there You can probably vault up the side of
that wall if Im not mistaken dont you think
 Oh you told me about your ability to make
things quiet around you
 When I hold him you yank him off of the
wall and then Humpty Dumpty you know they cant
put him back You know how it goes
 You are going to help Beauregard here up
onto the wall quietly after you use your
 Whatever you call it Then she gets up there
and I am going to use my tricks to hold him and
let her rip him off the wall and split his skull
upon the stones beneath
 Pretty complicated
 I pull out a little wire and whisper into it
here so we should probably get set
 Well shes a party maker noise you know

 Matthew
 DM where would you say in relation to this
map the two groups are
 So  feet apart probably
 Like about that far
 Ayy
 When you get on the wall off of Nilas
shoulders and you do the handhold thing You know
what Im talking about
 Right underneath him
 That is an excellent idea
 Yeah You and I were good We have this
little routine Beauregard can do that on this
side What about on your side You Youre short
 What are you doing over there Nott
 Nott I have a question for you The plan is
not foolproof but on our side over here
Beauregards going to throw the asshole off the
wall If you shoot your asshole and he does not
die but starts screaming what do you do
 Or you could attack at the same time
 Said Liam
 Yeah the sequence of events is that you two
need to get onto the wall successfully
 Youve got your javelin tied up
 I say three two one
 No Are they in place
 Im going to hold Hold Person until these
two are right under the guard
 Use the dodeca if you need to
 Luck you have luck still
 But you have a luck left
like
 You got one left
 No Caleb seeing this wouldve went drei
zwei eins Hold Person
 Take a shot
 Ten
 
 Oh held
 I send Frumpkin up into the air to do a
circle around the entire perimeter
 Achtzehn 
 Frumpkin saw all of this yeah Saw the
doors all of that Im going to creep my way to
the front door and as I go Im going to cast
Detect Magic
 Yeah
 Right to the outer wall
 Yeah I will wait until I am within  feet
of the wall and then I do so I will mutter a few words
 Sexy
 I like this guy
 I take my wire and I say
 Nott are you on
the ground still Can you meet me at the front
gates quietly
 Waiting very anxiously for my life partner
 Oh son of a fuck come on Ash
 Dont go lower than that thats got to be
the worst
 Seven plus
 Were at the front gate
 Okay I can get this open but I would
prefer to preserve my reserves so can you get
this door open
 I miss being a rogue every day
 I pull out the wire and get it between my
Is everything good up there from what you can see
Are we good
 There is another door over there Lets get
to that door
 Were at the front gate
 Yeah so we have to get to that door
 Theres no magic on the front door right
 Its like ten minutes so Ive probably got
four or five minutes left
 I think that we should cut around the side
and go to the back They will probably be
expecting that less
shouldnt be anyone in the kitchen
 Yeah okay
 I think we should leave them for the moment
to keep appearances up
 Okay but are you able to I dont
understand your peoples ways but are you able to
help her the way you helped Beauregard earlier
 That ability you had to make Beauregard
 So you could drop it and do it again
 Who has it now
 Lets tippytoe around the back door
 I miss Vax so much
 
 Plus ten whatever it is
 Yeah
 No these two We asked them if they saw
anything right before we went
 Im going to guess that I have two or three
minutes left on Detect Magic so does the door
seem clear of that
 It was on my iPad
 Luck luck luck Is there any gap between
the bottom of the door and the floor that Frumpkin
could fit through right now
 In you go buddy Hold on to my hand
please
 Telepathically I tell Frumpkin to crawl up
the other side of the door and go onto the ceiling
 Nila didnt tell us anything about a kitchen
from her
 Well thats where I will send Frumpkin
along the ceiling Then when he gets to a door he
can go down the door and under if there is a gap
and then up the door
 Are all these doors so far the same They
are loose
 A halfinch for Frumpkin
 I dont hear shit right now I will send
Frumpkin through the next gap
 No you cant tell me anything
 I will do this one here
 I will have Frumpkin back away under the
crack
 He is so little He is so small
 Just one roll Thats okay Hold on
everybody  Wait everythings crazy I need a
different browser window
 Well I rolled a  but its better than
that its 
  The Itsy Bitsy Spider
 Back under that door and he will peekypoo
under the door he has not checked yet
 Yeah this door This one here
 To the bottom
 Any cracks that are a halfinch wide big
enough for a spider
 I remember this Okay Thats a wall covered
by that paper there that you dont need to
uncover right
 Back out of this I know where I am I will
go along the wall here Frumpkin will crawl on the
wall Oh you cant see where Im pointing
 Yeah and crawl around the corner and peek
around the corner into that colored spot
 This is too complicated for me to mutter so
Im not telling everybody this This is too complicated
 I dont hear anything and youre nowhere
near me What I will do is send Frumpkin down this
hallway because I did not go this way yet
 I remember this from her stories so I will
continue Frumpkin up the stairs
 Time is passing because hes not that
quick
 Well make for the wall at that point
 What does Frumpkin need to do armor class
right
 Zwlf
 He scurries away No he scurries up onto
the wall up onto the ceiling
  feet
 Theres a bug in this world and I wont
rest until hes dead
 Matt I dont know if this will happen in
time but what I tell him to do telepathically
because I should be close enough  feet is to
go in here through this door thats open and
over the door and down the back and once hes out
of sight I will poof him out if that works They
might hit him before it happens
 Its a spider
 But he disappears in the back of the door
 That was wild Okay Yes Oh hi Again
Theres two of them I pull a wire out and I aim
towards my friends on the horses Theres two of
them Six seconds go by Theres two of them on
the first floor What do we do
 I saw what the firbolg woman told us about
There is a trapdoor not too far from us here
  Ja okay thats good We have
to be very quiet
door
 Heres what we do Frumpkin I take
Frumpkin Oh theres Frumpkin I place Frumpkin
on your shoulder
 You have to go in this door and Im going to
talk into your ear Im going to hold Kegs
shoulder and I am going to talk into your ear and
tell you which way to go to get you to the
trapdoor Okay and you have to be very quiet
 Yeah and see if that trapdoor is open If
it is you will put my spider underneath and we
will see what is going on
 If its unlocked
 Do not go in yourself right away send in
Frumpkin to look I will be watching the whole time
 Its fine
 Halt I cast
 Ja I cast Knock on the door
 At every turn Listen to me At every turn
when you can go left or right if Frumpkin who
will be resting on your ear tickles the inside of
the ear it means go right If nothing happens go left
 Tickle means right
 Youve got it
 My hand is on Kegs shoulder in case things
go to shit
 Tickle means right left is nothing
 No
 Tickle tickle
 I drop it Were in go I walk into the
building
 Thats not what I expected
 
 Did the sound of clattering pans clatter
outside
 Did the people outside hear it
 I slap my hand down on Kegs shoulder and I
with a free hand stick licorice root into my
mouth and start chewing and squeeze her shoulder
and you are Hasted And I will a couple of
things and I cant find my card right now but

on dexterity saving throws and an additional
action on each of your turns
 You are very fast right now
 I start moving into the building as far as
I can actually Behind Nott
 By the doorway Yeah thats good
 Pressing into the wall there so that people
can get by me
 Oh thats terrible
 Thats up to you

 Oh look theres somebody laughing and
giggling on the floor

 Done and done
 Wait why What
  You motherfucker Matthew Mercer We
will have words about the rules that exist
 Wow
 Its dispelled but the stun still happens
 Thats some bullshit Matthew
 Whatever you say but still thats some
bullshit
turn
 Yeah its wasted
 On all saving throws
 The hit points are phenomenal
happened with Molly I
 Oh no Come on
 Maybe if we offer Taliesins new character
in exchange for our lives we can get out of this
right
 You know you want to roll a halfling
sorcerer come on
 We just destroyed the door
  Welcome back
 Wow I have a joke Im going to keep it in
my head This is all going much worse than I
intended it to so I am going to tug on the glove
and Im going to slap it and send out three
 Get him Beauregard youre the monk
Scorching Ray three times on the barbarian First
one is shit
 Second is a  First is total shit second
is a 
 Third is better than that
 That is eight for the first and eight for
the second
 I have had very bad luck with peoples
skulls so I am going to send the fire into her
thighs and legs and burn the bottom of her torso
and even the center of her being her stomach and
make it burn in upon itself and harden in
blackened crust
 Thats a 
 Thats the first time I did that First time
I did not go into a state
 
 Stay alert Were not done here
 Wait for me
 Nott wait for me
 Attune to the sword
 I will find Nott Have you done everything
that you could here
 We all shouldve drunk more It is no shame
on you I place my hand on the trapdoor
 The door is locked
 I place my hand on the door and I cast
Knock
 Im going to walk through and find that
trapdoor that Ive already seen through Frumpkins eyes
 Yes please
 I back up about  feet out of this little
cubby
 A reach around
 Your mother watches this show right
 Is it open
 Open it No I hold up Frumpkin I place him
on the edge of the trapdoor and send him
scrambling under to look
 
 We learned so much
 Last week Taliesin was hanging like Tom
the table waiting to drop in and we all thought
it would happen near the end of the episode but
it didnt It didnt How does it feel to finally
let that little bit of rope cut and be in the game again
 I like this guy
 I like pink more than purple if I can say
 Yes
 I like pink a little more than purple
 What I dont like about this is that the
asshole was sleeping upstairs and we dont know
about that at all but I send Frumpkin along the
ceiling and through that looks like a barred gate
 I will attempt to send Frumpkin over his
head along the ceiling stealthily
 Humanoid thats it
 Im going to keep going and you said roll
 Very good that is a 
 Yeah he pauses hes looking for green or
blue or goth
 Ja
 So would Frumpkin be at the edge of that
gate
 I rolled a  last we checked and that was
 seconds ago
 Do I see this
 
 There are more people down there This is
the xfactor we spoke about
 I saw two down there correct
 Right but I mean in that last room
 And I did not see Lazlo so he could be
upstairs
 No its Lazlo Im pretty sure

 I didnt see el boogie down there so he
could be upstairs or downstairs is what Im saying
 We do not know that We know that there is
one random shithead and two more beyond that and
I did not see Lorenzo or Lazlo or Larkin
 Yeah hes either behind us or down below
 Ja there were some people in cages but I
did not get a good look at them through my
spiders eyes
 Here is what I think
 We have a bit of a
bottleneck here at this trapdoor If they want to
come up they have to deal with us ja
 So if the majority of us wait at this trap
door and I send my spider upstairs to see whats
going on to see if our friend is up there we can
learn about upstairs and if anyone pokes their
head out of that door theyre going to lose it
 Lets keep figuring things out
 Yeah
 Close it quietly and if anyone has a look
around
 Wait its true you look like one of the
guys upstairs you could go down and tell them
But well you are putting a lot on the line for
people youve just met tonight
 Yeah
 Simultaneously Caleb will slap his hand
down on Kegs shoulder and send Frumpkin on the
ceiling or on the first floor towards the
stairwell at the front of the building
 Roll fucking high Marisha
 Oh my god

 Phil am I right
 Caleb is not here he is in the spider
 Spidering
 Frumpkin is still climbing towards the
stairwell up and I am computing everything that
our druid friend told me about the stairs to see
if Big Man is asleep in his room
 I tell you what Im going to do
 Im at the top of these stairs Boy its
hard to say because the map is gone but I think
what I will do is Ill drop out of Frumpkin for a
moment and I have  feet of movement so I will
walk  feet towards those stairs
 Yeah
 Yeah towards the second floor
 Oh wow If Im able I will stand on my own
and go back into Frumpkin and wait because he is
far ahead of me Frumpkin and my friends are
mostly behind me but Im okay
 I cant hear anything
 Oh thats great
 Do I feel you next to me
 Do I If I feel the dwarf next to me I
would use a free hand to jam some licorice back
into my mouth and start chewing furiously
anxiously Im so scared of everything And cast
Haste again into the dwarf
 One minute ja I know You are again on
methamphetamines
 No your luck is dead
 Oh you saved it 
 Oh no Its a one
 Thats right Whatever one you want
  I dont like it
 I have so much murder in my eye right now
 What do you mean
 Things are really bad in the Mighty Nein
when Nott is the soft member of the group
 See player characters killed live in
Indianapolis
 Sumalee Sam and I were talking about
bullshit before the beginning of the game and I
forget the context but he was talking about you
and I said No shes never played She played
one practice game before this and Sams brain
went 
 No no no were not They cut the stream
Tell us about your politics
wait are we
 I cant hear you but we dont have much
time so lets move forward carefully please and
its just the two of us so you know help me out
will you
 Further up Hes made it to the second floor
I think I didnt pop out so Im seeing what
Frumpkin sees at this point
 I cant hear a thing shes saying
 Well they told us that they would wait for
us before going down and Im sure that they have
done that

 Oh but I cant hear you Looking through
Frumpkins eyes theres no time to waste Ive
Hasted her to protect me since its just the two
of us but I have to move upstairs So Im going
to feel my way up the stairs and hope that Keg
comes along
 While I ask Frumpkin to continue along the
right path
 And this is where the plan falls apart
 I am processing right now I havent made a
decision in a splitsecond
to keep going forward
 Okay that could have gone better
 No no no Lets wait here for a second
Frumpkin my boy will you please go ahead
 I will gently pull Keg around the corner of
the left path five feet so we are not in direct view
 Well if Frumpkins going this way I will
move Keg and I a little bit that way so we are not
in direct view
 I will let Frumpkin continue and watch
 What are we doing Lets have Frumpkin look
under that door that was just revealed
 Theyre preoccupied
 I come out of Frumpkins vision and I take
Caleb Caleb is me I take Keg by the hand and go
me please
 And tell Frumpkin to go up that side and we
will go up the other side
 Frumpkin can get there just ahead of me and
peek around that corner before we turn it
 We scooch to the corner
 Okay Rinse repeat I send Fumpkin under
the first door pull Keg a little bit further so
we are by those doors
 I pull out the copper wire listening and I
coming from the upper floor I dont know if
theyre leaving or coming away but be alert
 No the stairs were down in the corner
closest to us
 I will say in the meantime that I would of
course have sent Frumpkin into the final room to
know if we have cleared this place up here
 Quickly do I see anything of note in this
room
 
 
 Okay Well if we are still alive in an
hour there will be time for this later I leave
it Listen youre not going to see me for a
while but I will be with you
 No I am not

 Yeah ditto kiddo It galls me to do this
because I will only be able to do it the one time
Fuck it I pull out the scroll of invisibility
that Calianna gave me and recite a few words and I am gone
 Then you feel a taptaptap on your
shoulder
 Quietly please and I will not be walking
right next to you but a little ways away You can
trust me I will not leave your side
 Carefully
me of that that would be great
 Oh one other thing and theres a little
flash on your shoulder and there is a largeish spider

 A little quieter than that please
 Thats the ticket Lets go
 Youre a beast
 A disembodied voice says
 Oh This is going
wonderful
 I am actually over here though
 Okay I whisper into Notts ear and say

 Just this once I think I should go first
 Im not there anymore

 Brave Dead Its semantics really
  for me
 I am going to move into the room and sit
down on the floor between the cage and the door
pressed against the wall
 Ja and just wait
 
 
  over here
 Itll be your spell plus Oh its none of
these
 Act natural

 Im going to slide out away from Nott and go
to the other side clear of the hallway to look
into the cage thats there
 To the other side of the room Is anyone
alive or dead in that cage
 That is a 
 Okay Er Hello I am invisible Stay as
low as possible and this will all blow over
quickly I think Thats the end of my turn
 What are you trying to roll
 I am very stealthy
 This seems to be going okay not so bad Are
those tables by the gate that Keg and Beauregard
are trying to pull up Not the room Im in I am
going to kick one over and roll it over because I
can see Keg jimmying on the gate I see where she
is going with it and I am going to be ready to
push it under once its lifted up I will hold my
turn but I am going to do that pushing my rear
end out of the way of view of anyone even though I
am invisible
 Yeah okay
 What could go wrong Big six
 I have average strength
 Yeah okay
  Yeah this table is pretty heavy
too
and try the second door
 Spiritual Weapon it
Nefertiti Lets see if we can find something she can hit
 Yeah okay Since the gate is open Im
going to start slowly walking down the hallway
after Nott sticking close to the wall Thats as
far as I get
 I could but I dont want to do that I will
put Frumpkin on the wall opposite me ten feet
ahead of me I would love to give Frumpkin his
turn to go as far along the ceiling after Nott as he can
 Oh you know  feet
  feet
 Okay and I will just stay pressed against
the wall and that is the end of my turn
 In Beauregards ear she hears
 I am in the
hallway ahead of you Chill out for a moment I
will continue to let Frumpkin creep around if we
are in that sort of a scenario
 Bugs The shows all about bugs now Bugs
 As you pass in the hallway you hear
 If I am able to now I will send Frumpkin
over the ceiling and down the door and if there
is a crack he will go through
 No
 Ja If theres a gap ja
 Frumpkins not invisible is he
 Good news I rolled a one
 They Are Going To Die

 I start moving up through the hallway
Nott ja its still me Im still invisible
You need to check that door I dont know if its
trapped or
 You checked a trap in this room didnt
you
 Frumpkin went under a new door
 I point invisibly and say
 The door that Im
pointing at That one
 A gentle knock happens on the door in front
of her
 The other side
 Ja I would prefer it We are blown
anyway so have at it
 We are just giving them time to be ready for
us We need to proceed
ears grandpa Then I smack the door with my hammer
 Caleb is silently making the jerkoff motion
in the room they are standing in

 Lets get this door open
 Maybe Nott will you have a look at it
first
 Caleb is already in the next room steering
clear of the trap and trying to inspect if that
brazier is arcane in nature or if there is
anything dangerous other than the trap
 Ja
 If only I had gotten to say natural 
before that happened
 Oh thats one of those
 And am I aware of that the trap What sets
it off since I got the natural 
 Proximity alone
 I am in the room There are a couple of
options I could dispel it It would take me about
ten minutes I would no longer be invisible we
would lose time
 The second option is that we just run for
it
 Yes

 There is a deep deep sigh in the room and
then Caleb descends into the hole
 Ja
 Oh good roll
 Shakste would you er Friend would you
do us the favor of Stacy Is it Stacy or Anastasia
 Okay I used to have a cat I do not any
longer
 Would you do us the favor of having a peek
around with your bird friend
Duchess if you wouldnt mind taking a peek
 Where are all you cosplayers at Do me a
favor I love you all but if youre not in
costume sit down for a moment so I can see all
the costumes

 Up high I see you guys up high I see you
down low It never gets old Fucking amazing
Great job all of you

 Also question Who has the adorably
highpitched laugh somewhere over here Its you

 But thats what I mean too
 All right lets get this TPK moving

 Spoilers
 Scanlans gone man Scanlans gone
 Are the stairs wide enough for two people to
go down Three people to go down

what the Duchess saw she saw the chamber but no
one was in it
 You are able to do something so
substantial
 Im right in front of you
 Im right in front of you Im talking
about
 As big as Keg
 What are we doing
 Lets stop making so much noise and try it

theres no weight to your illusion What would
have been set off
 No its a person firing
 Its a person firing
 Caleb will come invisibly down but not
leave the stairs He will stay on the stairs
 Yeah halfway down But you can leave him up
there for the moment
 What are you
 Do you have a bonus
 
 I dont like this music
 Ah ja okay I think
 Im already gone In my head I think This
is still going very well I have not been hit
here we go And Im at the bottom of the stairs
already not at the top so what I would like to
do is move my full movement and then use my action
to dash And just stroll to the right of Nott and
I will just touch her on the shoulder as I go and
get as far as I can in that direction against the
wall if thats as far as I can get So  feet
 Ja thats exactly where I want to be And
then I will scooch down not fully sitting but
like bending my knees down and doing like a squat
And thinking This is okay This is okay Thats
the end of the turn
 Typically
 Okay this is still going very good so I am
going to slide along the wall that Im on to try
to get to the space where Beau had been before she
started Now that the little weasel is dead ja
Ill stay against the wall if I can
 Ja And then Im going to lose
Invisibility because I start to weave my hand
around my arm and I am going to release Scorching
Ray three globs of fire up his ass in the sky
 Well the first one was a natural zwanzig
so

 The second is a  and the third is a

 Yeah Im going to cut directly right
towards Caduceus and just before I disappear out
And I will send a Fire Bolt at Lorenzo

around the corner and leaning my face against the
wall like that

going on and I feel real bad so Im going to try

hes holding both of her blades Okay well I
probably wont hit but lets do it again pew pew
That is a six 
 Or is it Hold on let me double check
because my iPad died and I cant see my shit
Its okay everybody
Its 

 Its  points of damage
 Oh well fuck me running it worked I watch
it leave my finger and take an impossible
spiralling trajectory through the air and hes so
preoccupied with that charming dwarf woman with
the stubble it takes him in the back of the head
and it starts to burn through the back of his
skull and eat away through the back of his head
and burn through his eyes

 You shouldnt have killed my cat

 Also in the meantime DM I
 I have a question I dont know if the
situation calls for it I rolled a voluntary
wisdom save for
 Ja but I rolled an  so its a 
 Its better than it was
was but I think you should thank these people who
came down into the catacombs This is the second
time that Ive come across these people and
theyve gone from fresh air into dark dank air
for no other reason than to find people and to
help them out Theyre special as far as Im
concerned and you should remember them So what do
we call you
 You know we thought it would be a joke in
the beginning it kind of stuck It doesnt make
any sense Im going to go sit on the table that
got knocked all over the place during that fight
and sit and just stare at the three unconscious
and feel very tired
 Do either of you want to come with
 Seeing Beau go in ahead of me still sitting
on the table I mutter a word and cast Knock and
the manacles fall away
 Jester
 No we are sorry We tried our best but it
wasnt good enough
 We should be sure
 We need to give the house the onceover
Make sure there is nobody left We agreed to clear
this house of everything
 And we learn for the future
 this wont
happen again You understand me
 Kind of a moot point at this moment
 Oh Group effort
TRAVIS Sure it was Nott Thanks
 Too long
 Laslo has jumped bodies
 Lets go rob them blind
 I will hang out with her while you guys go
check the house Please bring me any books
 I will sit with her
 Short rest
 Weve heard that before
 Blue ink 
 I was waiting for the right moment to give
it back
 You find him while they were gone Caleb
holding the huge slash on his chest together and
the coat is ripped laid down next to Yasha
looking at the ceiling After a long moment of
 Im sorry we werent faster
 Caleb would know how many theyve seen
 Nein
 Are we all in the same room at this point
 I have a Never mind Ill tell you
tomorrow
 This is Oh
 I have been carrying this for you
 I know
 Looks better on you
 No I didnt think Thank you
 Yep Oh now
 Who has it
 Okay book out and on the floor and start
tracing the symbols on the floor and give me ten minutes
 Blood pudding
 Mmm coffee
 Hmm
 Oh Identify
 You guys know what this is
 This is a bottomless bag
 It can hold a lot though It can hold a
lot More than
 Yeah
 Who wants it
 Yeah Tradition
 What are we doing Are we staying here or
are we hitting the road
 Badass what do you want to do Are we
staying here or are we hitting the road
 Well I dont always look great but point
taken
 Thats a good idea I have a surprise for
you all
   Oh shit
 Yeah take all the hidden goodies inside
Its a piata
 Yer a wizard Harry
 We are dumbasses
 Caleb is doing the silver wire while that
happens
 Its a cantaloupe
 Excuse me just a moment Im sorry Does
cheap doesnt matter
 You have fifty rings do you have a glass
bead Necklaces anything Do you wear a glass
bead on you
 Do you have a bead
 Your rings do any of them have just a
glass are they costume jewelry
 He pries it Hes not very good at it
 Yeah okay good Throws the ring away
 As you were Then he starts muttering again
and walking around the circle that the silver wire makes
 Caleb is not paying attention to anything
going on
 Hes muttering and walking in circles
 Everybody hears some muttering behind them
of words they dont understand and then they hear
the entire entryway and there is a giant
halfdome of pale orangishbrown energy and then
you just see Calebs head go Hey look what I
made 
  Ja
 Only you
 No you walk in and as soon as youre in and
look back where you came you dont see what you
walked through you just see the room and
everybody around it  They can all
come in but be quiet
 Hello
 Probably
 Yeah you cant see us but we can see you
Ive been working on this for weeks
 You can come in
 I pull Fjord in
 So the idea behind this is that if we sleep
in a field or something nobodys going to come
and take us off to be tortured in the night
 We can go through it you can go through it
I can go through it well I have to stay inside
it but  excuse me
 I have bigger ideas for a big place but I
cant But this I can do
 A yurt
 It feels like outside but you know Also
if were ever in a tight spot and we know something
 I dont know if Im looking at Laura or
Jester if were ever in a tight spot I can also
do this if we are in real danger Thats a little
tricky because it takes some time to do it
 Like a hundred feet up I think
 I couldnt make any furniture yet But
anyway in a pinch and tonight And the alarm is up
 Its been done Nott
 Of course
 I cant make a side bubble so I dont
mean to intrude but what you said
 Thats a lot I will spend the next hour or
so before bed going through every single thing
slowly and methodically with my spellbook
 And that gem that you had Beauregard The
red gem
 Leave me alone Im reading
 This has great power
 Its a meat hook
 Is this what Yasha had on her Yeah
 No were good This potion will give you a
silver tongue for an hour or so
 Yeah like this one over here Or made this
one inhuman Ill come back to this This is the
manacles Yasha had on her when we found her This
is strange you put them on a person and someone
like me maybe Fjord could make that person fall
asleep for at least a day
 Well now we have it
 Nothing
 I pocket it
 What is it
 How big is it
  I was thinking oversized
handcuffs but nevermind
 You got that You can have this this is a
gem that can summon a creature of fire
 Yeah That is amazing That is powerful
 Its not my thing
 Not me and me alone
 Im good
 Is it Ooh
 Yeah Sleep until the afternoon
 We all saw this
 You just see a windmill of legs
 I go outside and get some fresh air and see
what I see
 
 Are they deep heavy dwarf footprints
 I rub my thumb along the lucky rock in my
pocket and smile at the snow and think about
playing in it when I was younger and go inside to
wake up anyone whos still sleeping
 Cling clang clung clung
 Name is spelled wrong too
 A charmed bracelet of dwarvenkind Just gets
a little bit of stubble
 Amazing
 Just give it to me
 
 That is magical in that it is very finely
crafted But it doesnt do anything expect cut me
across the chest quite deeply
 We have a long way to walk so is that what
were doing
 But also we should go back to Ophelia
Mardun
 No it is true The money meant fuck all
 No that is incorrect I would like my share
of the platinum to be sure Any coin that we
found please
 What is east
 Are we going to go to Ophelia first and then
to Mollymauk or
 Hes in the fields
 Just give me ten goddamn minutes Identify
the cart
 How does it work
 Also how long was the ride from Shady Creek
to this compound Like three or four hours
 Oh so slower by cart because
 Ja But worth it
 Ill sit up front
 Were on the cart
 No snaps for that one
 I feel like Lorenzo had his way with me just
now
 Nice try Foster
 The reason were not overflowing with Happy
Birthday joy and radiance is because we also have
a cold dead fury that shes not at the table
 Come back
 Remain inconspicuous you mean in the open
not hidden by the illusion of the cart
 Just a Jesus fish
 I look like a peasant Ill stay put
 Good evening Good day Good afternoon We
are expected by Miss Mardun
 Very well
 True
 I know this cart like the back of my hand
and if one inch of it is touched I will know
 Well as I said on our previous meeting we
have vetted appropriate people for the task at
hand which has been completed That is all you
need to know
 Everyone other than the common folk that
they had taken away have been put to the blade or
burnt to cinders
 You know the one who wields that weapon
 This one broke his jaw almost off of his
face and then his skull was burned to ash We
murdered everyone in that house who was not a
farmer It is empty
 Natural 
 We are amenable
 That is just fine There are more of us
waiting a ways away
 We have three more drei
 Well we have come with our own means of
transportation We can travel with you
  You could keep some of those
puns in your head you know
 Well the job is the job We will be
watching our own backs regardless but the job is
the job
 Thats not too much to ask
 Boy I wonder how long before Ophelias
ready to go
 This is the sticks right
 I think that everyone in this town is
dangerous so eyes wide open
 Do you spend time in the no you have been
alone
 It still stands
 its pretty shitty
 Hes been living in a cemetery
 Exclusively for a number of years
 Still a cemetery though
 Its strong at first but
 Yes but you get used to it and it mellows
the longer youre around him
 It has not been that long since I took a
shower I dont know why this running gag is continuing
 Of course Quinn
 We need our cart to be driven
 In the two carriages
 Just hers
 I will enter the second carriage if they
are looking for people
 I think perhaps we are the intermediaries
here Why dont you ride with me
 No not at all Cut them loose
 Shes missing a lot of context on that
sentence
 Got to keep Mamma Mia
 Can I interject for a second
 Since this is a lot of time thats passing
and its just Beauregard and I in this carriage
can I as a ritual spell cast Detect Magic and
check out the cart around us
 Are you whispering to me through the doorway
or
 Ja 
 Excuse me Once were past the border and
time has passed and the two Empire kids are
sitting alone in this carriage Caleb staring out
 Who are you You know an awful lot about me
now You are not some  youth throwing
themselves on drink as you tried to claim when we
first met You are clearly tied to something
greater than that You are not some fuckup Who
are you
 Thats a separate issue Were very
different but not completely I would feel a
little safer if I knew a little more about you
 Okay
 Her or you
 Right
 Why are you out here in the wastelands
 Now you what You want to follow the orders
of the Cobalt Soul You want to do whatever they
ask you to do Or something you want to do Why
are you running around with criminals And me
 This is all orders you are following
 Okay So a little bit of official business
A little bit of your own personal axe to grind
  Ja Danke
 No
  Cool
  Im alive Im happy
 Yes I pull out my own wire and I aim
a few moments on the side of the road here
 Ja ten  minutes Nothing more
 Caleb scoops Nott up out of the cart that
shes in and we watch from a distance
 What time of day is it
 He tried to get to your side He tried very
hard
 Knowing how young Nott is I hold her closer
and rest her head on my shoulder and walk away
from this very painful thing to look at
 Come everyone Molly wanted us to keep
living
 Back in the carts
 There is always a cost
 I dont know but Caleb would know it
exactly
 Also since we spent so much time in those
carriages I would have spent a full day with my
lucky rock that I found and those ideas I had
have come to fruition I have set it just so
 I have Luck again I got a new feat
 Cheers
 Never again
 Yeah but hold on Also rewind Seven or
eight days on the road how much money do we all have
 
 Not as much as I wanted
 Of course she did
 Actions Spell Equipment and then touch on
the icons of the coins in DD Beyond
 No of course not
 The internets full of troublemakers
 But its all platinum Right
 He might
 We all have roughly something platinum
 Detective

it is really good to have you two at the table

 That is correct He had his own business to
attend to We parted ways
 Natural  Thanks Matt Colville
 It didnt end well It seems doubtful but
ja if we see him again rest assured
 Im going to plonk down in front of Fjord

 Bit of a little side conversation I slap

the razors edge of death so you know I feel
like you should embrace the morbidity of life

is
 I am in the market for some things of arcane
nature Oh I see youre reading a book What are

mighty dearth
 Thats a different conversation danke I
need about roughly  or  golds worth of your
finest paper and ink

gold worth if you have that much on hand

need more than the  golds worth of incense
today if you can order more Were going to stay

 Ill ask you later Also oh dear I need
that and I need that Oh yes I was hoping to
look through your selection of spells you have
yourself Nothing too majestic but I have a short list

friends are falling and you dont want them to
fall so hard
 Okay I get hurt very easily and I need
something to help me get out of Dodge a little bit
quicker

 But I also want to be able to do it
 Im not paying for that
 Ja Straight Up Catapult is that what
its called Ill take that as well

 How much is that running for
 
 Sad youre not here
 Oh Im allocating my funds to other things

hotel room an inn and take the lucky rock and
Im going to fill it with transmutative power and
make a Transmuters Stone out of it and for now
we will have it let me see in the dark For now I
would also transcribe every spell that was in the
book and every scroll that I have found so that I
use up all the paper that I have purchased Have
every spell And Frumpkin is back As a cat
 There is only one Frumpkin I stayed up all
night doing all of those things because theyre
very timeintensive and would have went to find
Beauregard very tired and ready to go to stay at
the library as long as I am able She said a
number of days and when those days are up the
thing that I would do is spend as much time that
is left with the I would borrow Jesters
haversack if she would let me and spend time
with the dodecahedron
 I want to learn all of the martial arts
 Hallo
 Oh thank you Thank you
 Bobobobobobobo
 If I had four days to peruse at will I
would have spent the first day trying to research
anything I could find about Xhorhas the
Xhorasians mentions of beacons of them living
many lives their religion if possible
 Investigation That is 
 Pray to the great god titty
 Do I find any mention of these beacons he
mentioned beacons plural and reincarnation or
multiple lives
 I spend a day reading about that I will
spend every remaining day reading about I was
rushed the first time I came here so Im going to
spend every day left reading about the weave of
time and any mortals attempts to control it
 
 Nearly killed Does it talk about any of the
people who were nearly killed but werent
 No record of their names
 I would still have spent the entire three
days reading about that
 Dunamis
 Ja good cool Super cool Danke Then
Im all done with all my shit
 Is the Traveler happy with you yet
 Just everybody think back to the stink eye
Laura gave us on the hospital run
 Jeez Louise
 Im old
 Somewhere in another part of the city
 Wait they all blink out
 Got any spell slots left
 Not since Scanbo I think
 That is also the most exciting night Kumas
has had in ten years
 Its almost like a game of DD
 Feed me
  I want rice pudding
 I got a lot of reading done
 Oh library books so theyre not mine
Thats the beauty of a library
 Is this a realization that you had
 You were off on your own Are you okay
 Thats true
 Is it an actual cove
 An abused cantaloupe
 Oh no No I have no specific destination
in mind Im happy to accompany you if the group
sees fit
 No I have never been out of the Empire
 What about you
 Cant Jester send messages
  Who are you drinking
 And not very explained at all
 Well what if you tried
 How about right now
 Is there any of this that you have not
shared yet
 You speak of a remedy How do you mean Do
you mean you would rid yourself of that blade
these changes in you Or am I not hitting it
 Oh good morning
 Our next destination
 For what its worth Fjord Soltryce Academy
normally starts with younger students Not
exclusively but generally
 I dont know
 Were all agreed then that Fjord eats
poop
 After what we have been through in the last
month itd seem foolish to split up now Im
curious about the Menagerie Coast
 She would be okay with you
 Seven spell slots later
  Okay Im starting at the top
again
 It is dangerous there
 Not yet
 Wheres the map Is that on the way
 Oh its to the north its not towards the
Menagerie Coast
 Wheres the map
 Do you want to propose it to the group Im
happy to go of course
 Whats the time limit on that Its the end
of the month right on the delivery And were at
the beginning of this month or the middle
 Beginning
 What if that is the next place we go
 So much water on this road
 Tell you what
 after the coast we will
propose it to the group If they dont want to go
I will go with you
 Eh I dont know
 Go ahead
 I mean Ive expanded my repertoire I have
a few new tricks that I will hold onto for the
right moment Are you okay
 Okay You seem a little restless to me
 Im working on mine Mine is a little
longgoal perhaps
 You know what Ive done
 Well I dont have one plan in mind Part of
me thinks that I should just stop it from happening to
anyone else Part of me is very selfish and wants
to carve it out of my past
 Its dangerous not just to me
 That is true You are my greatest friend
 I like you because you are funny but its
more than that We will get you what you want
Even if there is some risk Because if its really
important its worth the risk ja
 Okay You and I we have an agreement A
pact
 Whatever you need we are going to make it
happen
 Ja
 If it is in my power I will do it
 Thats funny Ive never been to the beach
 Done and done
 The Cad in the Hat delivers
 We could go anywhere on the planet at any
time
 Matt we want to go to Brazil No Norway
 Too real
 Caleb has to find new garage sales to dive
through
 Oh Im thinking back on it now
 Ask Jester to show you the thingy in her
bag
 Okay ignore that

 Hurry up and stuff that thing back in her
bag
 You are not allowed to you know

 Thank you for bringing it back to the
material plane

 Point of order

a little more put back together
 Theres the Feed  Mead Tavern theres
Broad Barn theres Crate and Barrel
 Good times
 Nabend
 Any trouble here at home
 Yeah maybe stay for the night before moving
on
 No I am all set
 The trend is that its pushing closer in
 Coin
 Wait hold on hold on
 Just a point of clarification were talking
voyeuristically because of your household you mean
 I just want to understand what we are
talking about You know up close is different
than from behind a boudoir
 Im curious about your you
 Only because when I saw it last it was a
bit of a mess It was a little bit Egg McMuffin
if you know what Im saying
 Traditional Zadash breakfast
 DPB
 Ja but still
 Heres a question Once we get to the
Menagerie Coast I feel like well have a good
sense of how Nott is at fitting in What is it

 You might not want mittens you know
 Youre fine when youre next to me
 That old chestnut
 No a roof is good Lets have a roof
 Its easy We stumble upstairs
 Morgen

 Liefen laufen loafen loben
 Also the nostalgia factor of seeing where
we all you know got hitched
 Have you ever been out of Empire
 Same
 I will pay for that
 Its done and done its already happened
 Im good Ive stocked up I am plush I
have more coin in my pocket than I ever could have
imagined and I have already spent most of what we
made
 No
 No Im good
 Ja
 Oh you two take it then
 Where are you going
 I poke my head between them What are you
doing
 I send Frumpkin to go look at the rocks
 Ten
 Can he climb to the tippytop
 Im looking down at us
 Turn around
 Having to do K turns as a person is rough
 Does it look like there is anything buried
any digging done here
 
 Sorry 
 Thats a bingo
 Hold on I send Frumpkin to get down by my
hand to look up so that I can look at what Im
grabbing to make sure that it is not one of those
bags with teeth or something that I have read
about in fairytale stories
 One moment
 Some loot Maybe
 No first Frumpkin goes to look so I can
see what Im seeing
 I dont like all these euphemisms I pull
the bag out
 Caleb takes the bag and he puts it in
Jesters hand and starts to quietly dance around
 I take one gem and say
 This is a sixfoot
tall stack of paper Were taking them
 Did you find it in your pants
 While everybodys arguing Im going to sit
down and Detect Magic as a ritual
 Oh ritual casting Detect Magic but thats
ten minutes of stoppage
 I am busy
 Nothing stones the dirt Okay were good
This place is clear Lets get the hell out of here
 I lost all my dicks
 Thats how it works right Everyone in the
bed is
 It was Travis
 Yeah if its easy Yeah
 You have a trost here thats what you do
 I wasnt paying attention
 Could I get a bowl please
 Oh I was going to borrow from a friend but
yeah I will take a little bit of milk in it please
 I put it on the floor and I snap him into
existence There you go buddy
 No
 Yeah
 He really likes it
 No no No no no
 It is painfully true in my case And I tell
Frumpkin to start drinking milk
 Just a little bit Put some fat on those fey
bones of yours
 Please send me your emails for abusing my
fey magical cat
 Yeah its like Vax near the end
 Yeah like Vax near the end
  Oh this sandwich is so good
Mmm

 I dont think we have that Do we want to do
a little
 I dont think thats true but we could do a
token
 And if not I feel like we should keep a
certain amount for ourselves for our travels but
we could leave a token sum to help him on the
way
 Remember that Norda and Yorda
 In the morning
 If that is permissible ja
 Roughly how long has it been since we were
here
 Well Pleasure You know we meant to return
sooner but weve been a bit held up
 About that Were not staying in town We
are leaving in the morning actually but
 How much if its not too presumptuous how
much do you have left to work off
 What about remuneration an amount What is
left for him to work off
 Ja could you please
 Could you go look up that number for us
please
 He convinced the town that we all met
 Werewolves Next week Travis Willingham
living his best life
 Therewolves
 Its maybe a little bit for you but also
for a friend For Im not good at this does
someone want to
 We were fond of him and he was fond of you
so
 Yeah so back to the situation at hand You
are suggesting we continue doing what were doing
  This got weird so quickly
 I will put in  gold
 We are at  now
 Jesus
 Just keep  and spend  of Mollys to
keep it simple
 Im keeping my money then
 Solid
 What will you do now
 Your guess is as good as ours
 Boy not that any of us can complain but
that guy likes to lay it on thick
 Thats tea for life
 Seems fake

 Im gonna go open and look at Wikipedia I
found it
 Looks so good on the purpleheart
 Intentionally late
 There it is
 I wish Laura hadnt quit
 She was so good on the show
 Were over big dick energy BDE is gone DPB
is in
 It just means youre really invested
Schlurp
 How far to the gate
 It needs to be empty the way it looks We
need to hop out now
 It needs to be empty the way it looks when
they poke at it So I think we should all spill
out now
 Just on a whim do you want to try to dispel
the enchantment the way you did
 What would I know about using that spell to
make this go away temporarily or for good
 Thats what Im after That is 
 Hey lets roll off of this thing and take a
walk
 Let them poke sticks in here and find
nothing
 Yeah but if they find the lot of us going
 when they look in thats bad but if
they poke at it and say Whats with this cart
we say its a very good cart
 Im getting out of the cart
 Or maybe Fjord would be good at that
 I will take the bag away and swivel it over
to Fjord
 He did it again
 Its an elven giant
 Nice Tal
 
 Oh he worked so hard on that
 And now the Ettin just wants to crochet
things with us
 That miniature is like the Garbage Pail Kid
card that you get  of It is the most frequent
find in the box
 Ettins Got a lot of Ettins
 In the meantime I pull out a white feather
and I trace a triangle in the air and I cast Fear
on this one
 
  is the DC
 I tap Nott on the shoulder
 Those two just saw their worst fears
 Its so beautiful
 Wait now he can spin it around and its a
different part of the canyon entirely
  feet later
 This is like old animation where it just
repeats and repeats and repeats
 The Ettins are throwing boulders at us Go
go go
 I assume it is yeah Yeah Where did it go
Where did it go This is my first time casting it
 If the creature ends its  must
take the dash action If a creature
 For the duration It just says it becomes
frightened for the duration
 One minute
 Im looking Where is it Do you see it
 Oh if it doesnt have line of sight on me
it makes a wisdom save
 Noice noice noice
  Jester where did you land
 Aww
 How far away oh boy
 Caleb is going to jump out of the back of
the cart
 Im going to move to here
 And as Im moving forward Im pulling out a
pinch of iron powder And I let go of it and pull
my fingers apart and Beau again becomes
Swoleregard
 And I will use the rest of my movement I
think its five or ten feet more then to back
away towards the cart once Ive done it
 Dont let them down
 Thats why I did this so I could see the
big mini Matt
 Backing up towards the cart jogging
backwards
 Yep doing that backward jog
 For fucks sake
 Thanks Gil Fuck you Gil
 What was it
 I dont know if this is going to hit me but
Im going to risk going this way away from it up
onto the gray stone
 Yeah
 Ill take it
 Ten feet of reach probably
 But Im not done so pushing myself up and
trying to focus on the one on the ground and
seeing double hand on the glove tighten it and
Im going to release three rays from it and hit
the mic first and then hit the ettin on the
ground Is that at advantage because hes down
 Im going to do it anyway First one is ten
doesnt hit
 Second one is a 
 Yeah Third one is 
 Ugh I made six six one one So  points
of damage
 Its a two
  Oh sorry giantkin
  Jester got run over by a
reindeer
 That is amazing
 Yeah he doesnt move
  That was real convenient
guys
 Ja Im going to back up five feet away
and as I do so Im going to pull some bat shit
out of one pocket and some sulfur in the other and
slap them together and then stick my hands out
and cast Fireball at it
 Its a different kind Its a dex save but
hes stunned so I imagine hes not going to do
too well Hes still prone
 But hes prone
 Dex save
 So no That is a no
 Its a total of  fire damage
 Did I go five feet back from where I was
 Okay I feel very caffeinated right now
 If no one does anything else I will send
another Fireball  feet
  points of fire damage
 Because I have such an easy target at his
back I give a little bit of a curveball to it
and I make the fireball beam of red go 
 and erupt about  feet back and just
burn the backside
 Oh yeah okay
 Not great but at least were not under
attack A ten
 Youre still huge Oh Nope Yeah youre
huge
 Is Enlarge still in place if Im out of it
 I would think
 How long did it take for Caleb to come out
of that
 A minute I should probably stop doing
that
 Okay
 Okay Lets go catch the cart
 A thought I had earlier point of order
the first time I did the hut it was bright
orange but Ive learned that I can control that
so through experimentation I would say if we are
ever in a field of grass the hut would be the
color as close as Caleb can get it to the grass
It wouldnt be mottled or anything it would be
still slightly abnormal because it would be one
solid color If we are in a stony area I would
try to match the gray Just something I add to my routine
 Did you say Drudy
 By the way Caleb has stayed behind He has
no interest he is keeping the hut up and petting
his own cat and watching
 Twin cups 
 Sam would you like an animal companion
 Caleb is very judgmentally petting his cats
head
 Beaus hard shell drops
 Taliesin Taliesin this ones for you
  Blink dog Blink Motherfucking
blink dog I mean Im not there 

 Why did you put this in front of us Matt
Why
 No that blink dog is cool
 Think how effective an animal companion was
when you were a ranger and now you have none of
those skills
 You could take it though
 This is revenge for all the times Dagon bit
us
 Damn it
 And I take out a little metal wire and I
add to this conversation and say you are
responsible for this animals stealth checks
 Weasel
 This is in my daughters campaign of
eightyearolds all the girls are like Can I
have a pet Its just like that with these two
 Yeah what about the owl and the weasel
 Nothing is more important than this
 Oh its so cute
 If you guys are wandering back Caleb is
giving Jester the vaguest stink eye as he
scritches Frumpkins head
 That is super Good for you
 Why do you bring up the number of people in
the party
 What do you mean
 Yeah here have some Tamagotchi
 You know Caleb doesnt like the blink dog
but keep the blink dog because Liam loves it
Keep the blink dog
 ALF please dont eat the blink dog

 Lot going on here
 Work hard play hard
 Well
 Peanut butter and playa dust though Nah
 No its not
 Ja what is there to see
 No I have never seen the ocean
 What do you what
 Does that mean that he would hire people to
kill you or he would personally kill you
 But is wealthy and connected
 You locked him out
 What about besides your mothers place of
employment Do you know are there other things to see
 Okay
 You want to go straight there
 Right on the coast you saw that
 Well sometimes okay Point stands
 Is there easy access to the water here
 Caleb has just been staring for a while and
is standing next to Nott He takes off every
stitch of clothing and everything except for one
thing and hands it to Nott and walks in
 Yes
 Im just going to walk out into it
 He would keep going and eventually start
floating on my back
 I have a question Right now where is the
Lavorregard menagerie
 Where is the owl the weasel
 Owl too Owls with you
 I need constant updates to where these
animals are
 Thats the weasel
 If she has ten gold pieces worth of incense
she can bring it back to nope
 Mr Owl how many handling checks does it
take
 Scheisse 
 You cant just sneak up on a person
  Oh its very quite nice
 I tuck down four feet
 Well no I am just submerging my bits
 No its expansive it just keeps going
forever
 Why did you leave it
 So it feels good to be back ja
 So maybe you stay this time
  feet out
 I take a moment and scan the beach and call
in the ocean
 Who cares Go swimming
 I dont know She doesnt like to swim I
dont think But youd imagine seeing something
like this would give perspective
 Is this one of those sea monsters they were
talking about
 You have not seen the ocean
 Its pretty nice isnt it
 Should we stay here for the night
 What about tomorrow Do you want to go
tomorrow Does she know youre coming
 What are you doing
 Who are you talking to
 Get the map Wheres the map
 Seems like it could be potentially
hilarious
 The closest thing Ive experienced to this
is inside Jesters backpack In the dodecahedron
 There was a lot of baked goods in there
yeah Now its just
 No Its a good day
 That is how long again
 No idea
 How far is Port Damali from here roughly
 We were the only two people in that cell
  That is correct
 Ja thats on you buddy
 But under normal circumstances because you
look this way but would everyone know you here
 Before entering I would look for an
alleyway in the last few minutes before getting
here to make all of my clothes look I cast
Disguise Self on myself and dont change my
appearance other than to make my clothes look
brand new and slightly more expensive than they are
 By all means
 Dont insult my dignity just give me the
muumuu
 Yeah its like a lap dog
 Sprinkle and Nugget and Professor Thaddeus
Excellent
 Whats the name
 Im a heathen What is dupioni silk
 Okay
 I was just curious
 Is it like the velour Juicy sweatpants that
I saw when I first moved here
 Legitimately just curious
 Thats dupioni silk I knew that Dupioni
Bob Dupioni
 Is blue the predominant color here
 I buy the group a round
 Are we in the front or the middle or the
back
 Okay How big an audience space is it
 Roughly how many people are crammed in here
at a guess
 Okay
 I covered that
 Whatever is expected here Caleb covers
 But Caleb does not not know that and does
not tip He has no experience with any of it
 Now coming to the stage
 Whip it out hows it look
 So I got to look at it
 Would she sing with you when youre alone
 Did you sing with her
 When you first told us about your mother
 The night isnt over yet
 I would assume so yeah
 Is there a time of the day or the week that
you would have motherdaughter time
 Its marquiz
 You have a beautiful singing voice Thank
you very much for the performance You have a
very charming daughter
 I am afraid so ja
 Fish out of water yeah
 What was that last name again
 You are unable to speak to the law here
 Just speaking hypothetically it would not
upset you any if he were to disappear
 Not be around
 Well we will try our best to reach the
optimum result
 Dyomin
 What are these interests you are referring to
Her interests you said to our friend Mr Clay here
 Well it is good that we have the worlds
two best detectives with us That should be an
easy task to fulfill
 Bob Loblaw
 Are we saying if or are we saying is
 Your mother might know for sure
 Id like to think the party is legitimately
this excited
 That is the cartoon character Daria
 That message probably interrupted a
threesome
 I want to hear some  phone voicemail
message thrown on top of that
 In the ocean
 Im   years old I kick
 Definitely not Definitely Nott
 Oh I was going to ask if she could recommend
any bookstores but I was mistaken about
what the topic was
 Can you recommend any bookstores here in the
city
 Caleb for all of this for the last hour
has been trying to figure out if she seems okay
So in this moment does she seem okay
 But you know what I mean Even prior to
finding out that news I mean seeing her mother
Im saying for the entire evening here even
before that
 Yeah but Im not asking Im just
wondering
 Ask him what
 Youre also not constantly perspiring or
anything
 Nott are you going to go swimming with
her
 Its a question mark right now but there
will be another chapter to that story
 Why dont you give him a few days to
ruminate on what you have just said and see if
anything returns Or maybe we will return Its
your decision
 At the very least I think you should sleep
on it
 I bet youll go right to sleep ja
 Its good that you got to see your mother
though You seem very happy to see her
 Are they all kings
 You should probably be speaking to the
people on the docks yeah
 In Zemnian its pronounced key You said
quay
 Hype man
 Russian accent Vague
 You cannot mix those two impressions
together Its too dangerous
 I suddennly remembered
my Charlemagne  Doesnt work
 Les Paul
 Maybe its built into the architecture of
the rooms within
 Only one way to find out yeah
 And human
 Hallo
 Hes juggling a lot of plates
 Please Last week I was like How does this
shit work What do I do here
 How long have you been presiding over it
 That is respectable
 Oh man You just triple lutzed over Purvan
and flew beyond
 So its past the boob
 Its a lot of steps I can see why youre in
such good shape Grandmother
 But it seemed like you were about to
discuss youve seen his pattern in the city
where he goes day to day
 The Sluice Weave perhaps you are talking
about
 You said Sluice Weave Oh they said it Eh
shit happens Forget it
 Banished from the game
 She is invaluable to us She is a capable
woman We need her
 Youre hardly ugly on the outside
 I think you could snap me like a twig
 That was a long walk though This is an
awkward goodbye
 I was also going to say as they went down
that Caleb is going to make a big todo and start
about when were above I am in the market for
some books and I was wondering if you knew of any
bookstores
 Did you call dibs on the dodeca
 But you know a fullon library or perhaps
you know a smutty bookshop even because you
never know what youre going to find in there Or
even a used a vintage book Oh youre not
even  Are there any bookstores in the
vicinity of this lighthouse
 Yes but
 I dont think she liked most of us but
shes pretty cool
 Yussa Renis
 We got a wizards tower
 This is the worlds largest mimic
 Goosh
 Yeah d per ten feet
 Did you reach up as hard as you could
right before you landed to split that speed
Is that how monks work
 Why were you trying to get into this tower
 Well okay Ive seen all kinds of places
many times that I didnt try to get into
immediately What were you trying to accomplish
 Sure So you saw it as a challenge you saw
it as a mountain to climb
 Thats interesting How does it pertain to
what we are trying to do today
 But we dont have to go we could keep
working on this tower
 It is very interesting but I thought we
were helping our friend here
 Right thats an easy thing to go to so go
to it
 Thats our solution for everything
SAM Yeah I will aid
 Oh boy
 We were at a lighthouse that is even taller
than this you we could go try to climb that if
youd like
 Fjord  it is very interesting and I
have checked the box in the back of my brain I do
want to understand what that place is
 Hmm Im curious but lets shelve it
 I know that youre embarrassed for wasting
your time here but you will get over it
 Thats what I really want You know how
little puppies they crash into things when theyre
theyre walking Every time he poofs out I just
want
 I like turtles
 So exotic
 All the strudel and schnitzel are so far
away now and we are in this exotic place
 Yeah
 What are those things coming out of the
shell Green tubes
 What do they do
 Caleb Widogast
 

 Tell us a story Orly
 Its just called the Sluice
 Im trailing him
 Yep trailing
 Do you live in these parts or are you just
passing through
 Apologies did we catch your name
 Oh my name is Caleb Widogast
 Caleb Widogast and this is my friend
Fjord
 Well not specifically to Fjord but to our
group We are an odd bunch a collection of
people so you know we tend to get our noses in
things
 When we need to be at sea we have Fjord
When we need to crunch numbers we have me and we
have others as well
 Ja
 Two only Do you have room for well its
just six right now
 This is certainly possible You are heading
back to Marquet you say
 Well keep it in mind
 Oh also Im sorry if I could round back
for a moment to that tower I know you dont know
much but it sounds like youve been here longer
than we have Have you heard anything about it
Its so odd
 Agreed
 Yeah we sailed with her Vox Machina sailed
with her
 Yeah have I ever heard of this boat in all
my readings
 Completion The full set
 What are the odds Pretty slim
 What are you doing here
 Immediately You need to get on a boat
 Today tomorrow or
 Could we get a couple bottles of wine over
here please
 Fine wine
 You know Ive changed my mind The price on
that
 Give me the Two Buck Chuck please
 For the basic bitch wine correct
 Youre feeling a calling
 Its probable It has not been verified
 Yeah you know your standard angry
creeper
 Oh no Im still struck by the fact that you
have walked into this tavern where we are It
means something
 Is what Im saying
 Ja He was crucial in us getting the three
of you out
 It is funny how you keep showing up though
like a bad penny
 As soon as the animals come out I go to
talk to the barkeep
 From the bar
 it seems very doubtful Excuse
me
 You know Im still working on the first
one but I love your establishment
 Ja I will take a backup you are
correct
 While youre pouring I had a question for
you My friends and I we have just rolled into
town and while we were walking through we
noticed this very strange tower here Its so
bizarre what is that place
 That grows and shrinks when you walk toward
and away from it
 Dont know the name Just being casual you
know
 I ignore her like usual
 Well its just that it changed oh thank
you its just that it changed proportions the
closer we got or further away from it it didnt
seem natural
 Whose is it
 Thats it hes a mystery to the city I
suppose
 You have to be a jackass to climb a tower
like that its just ripe full of danger
 Shes you know a crass idiot Dont mind
her But
 This close Good job asshole
 Well thank you for your time He pours his
glass out on the ground out of the bartenders view
 Subtle Thank you very much for your time
 Youre yelling at me from across the bar
 Not in a German accent Marisha
 Or sleeping perhaps
 Also speaking from experience sometimes
when youre very focused on a task it can create
a blind spot
 Thats the worst shit thats ever been said
on this show
 This is totally the diner scene in Pulp
Fiction now
 Thats true you could piggyback
 Maybe ask a few more questions in a few
other places besides dive bars
 Have we been led to the boat
 Yeah Im leaving them and Im going to sit
in the boat Im pulling out my book and Im
slapping it down and I start to mutter to myself
This is going to take a while
 With all this dicking about how long would
you guestimate Ive been muttering in the boat
 Ten minutes okay
 A fucking stick up the back
 Although to be fair Ive seen this many times at
St Patricks Day parades in New York
  Excuse me officer
 This is so painful I feel like I should
make a concentration check on my spell
 Im casting Find Familiar and Im changing
Frumpkins shape
 Octopus
 Nott the Brave are you coming with us
 Come on I saved a seat up by me and
Frumpkin
 I have Frumpkin slither his way onto Notts
back and do a cozy hug from behind over the
shoulder Not on the head
 No because thats weird So just over the
shoulder and then the tentacles tickle her face
and stuff
 Thats the joke
 Can I assist by throwing Frumpkin into the
water and looking
 Frumpkin go take a look at that if you
wouldnt mind  Down towards it
 And I have my hand on Notts shoulder doing
that thing
 Do Frumpkin and I see anything alive or
moving down here
 Pretty good 
 How far apart are each of the bars
 I think my octopus could probably squeeze
through that
 
 Yeah
 Did they seem rusted
 Im going to urge Frumpkin on further to see
what we can see Frumpkin has dark vision
 Up he goes
 Darkvision yes
 Yeah crests up and pokes his eye nubs out
of the water
 Looking for anything moving here while
were up here
 So hes come through a second set
 Muttering all this as it happens
 This is all water
 Im going to speed him back to the first
grate and have him took for the locking mechanism
if there is one
 Thats investigation
 Or through an octopus Thats a 
 I think you said last campaign that you can
hold the air for one spell possibly
 Okay So he will swirl away and go back to
the second and do the same look around
 Ja
 Okay All right buddy
 Im sending him forward And I do
 Past you said it goes now straight that
way
 Not able for Frumpkin to squeeze through
that Im guessing
 Im imagining I am not summoning a gigantic
octopus
 And that would be strengthbased yeah
Because it doesnt say on his thing That is a nine
 Thats true Its only his second time Okay
buddy forget that Back it up Is there anything
unique about the pillar down here or is it just
basic stonework
 Are Frumpkin and I able to tell if this goes
water all the way to the ceiling of this chamber
or is it water with air above Or its all water
 Okay Is there anything out of the ordinary
if he pokes his head up out of the water
 
 You could always punch the wizard in the
head at any time
 Okay so back on the boat I just say I have
gone very far with him and it just keeps going
What do you guys want to do
 I cant hear any of you so tap me if you
times if you want me to pull Frumpkin out
 I said one or two I dont know what that
means
 What are we doing
 Pull him back
 Then I would tell him then to swim back If
we in our game are allowing connection as long
as its not broken I would just tell him to come
back
 I mean I could also if we want to hang a
little longer I can just send him You know I
dont want him to be squished but I can send him
as far as he can go to see what he hits Its up
to you
 Yeah of course Frumpkin is now like a
backpack on Yashas back
 That really sounds like a euphemism
 While theyre rolling I grab Notts
shoulder and turn on the Jacques Cousteau camera
on Yashas back
 My constitution must be low mines three
 Yeah just like I told you they made it
through the second grate
 I can see
 I think its a better idea for us to stay
together Nott you know this is a recurring thing
and I think we should what is going on What is
this
 Yeah but what if we need to go through
water
 Mostly but right now we need to
 Let me make a suggestion And I cast
Suggestion
 I think you should just try it one time and
see how it goes and if it goes well then we know
that you are good for the future
 Yeah we are
 And all she does is eat fish and do
pushups I think shell be good underwater
 Its the booze talking
 Its technically its slightly cocked
 It is cocked
 So this is a bit of a problem because nobody
thought of the dog and thats why I knew it was a
bad decision to purchase it in the first place
Because now we are stuck with a dog So what do we
do Caduceus What do you think
 Youre speaking in Sylvan correct
 Ja Im listening in Sylvan
 In Sylvan Caleb says If it goes wrong
pup you know bamf out and in and maybe thatll
buy you a little more time
 I dont care lets go 
 Oh
 Yeah Im here I would have beat Caduceus
here because he was struggling Im so proud of
you You made it all this way
 Do you know what the good news is Youre
going to have that feeling for the next seven
hours and  minutes
 Make an insight check

 Also there is a small grate just down here
Frumpkin was not able to get through it but maybe
one of you two ladies could bust that open
 Its right over there
 Octopus
 Yeah I did
 While theyre discussing I point at
Frumpkin on Yashas back and snap him out and then
submerge myself by that small grate and look and
keep my hand above the water and snap again and
Frumpkin is past the gate on the other side of
it
 The small grate that we couldnt get open
so hes on the other side
  Best lay ever
 
 What did you get Ash
 No I have the Transmuters Stone set to
dark vision
 Caduceus you can see
 Yeah okay so I was looking down towards
this grate under the water and I heard the room
go to hell behind me and hear the splashing where
Beauregard is so I move in that direction
 Yeah
 I take it yeah
 So I stumble forward and Im reaching into
my pockets and I pull out the iron powder and I
throw it into the air again and I go  with
my hands and Beauregard enlarges within the grasp
of this thing
 Yeah but with advantage on strength checks
now
 And I will go as far into that corner
hiding between Fjord and the corner if Im able to
 What about Fjord His swim speed is his
movement speed
 Added damage
 She lit it up
  Whats that Travis
whats that
 BDE
 What you numb your own tongue with that
one
 Okay Im going to move into that corner and
Im going to rifle into my pockets and pull out a
small snakes gut peppered in powdered rhubarb
leaf and I stick my hand out and point at the one
messing with my human friend over there and I
take the snakes gut and I pull it back like I am
drawing a bowstring as I mutter and I let go and
cast Melfs Acid Arrow
 Ja that is correct
 Melf MELF
 You love it That is a  to hit
 Yeah  Nine points of acid
damage
 It doesnt say anything at least in the
DD Beyond Lets look in the actual book
 Doesnt say anything about splash attack
 Dont do me wrong DD Beyond
 Im going to tuck my snake gut back into its
pocket
 Its six though
  Ja
 I cast Dancing Lights and the four globules
start floating around in the air
 Ja Okay Frumpkin Would you like to
are you still there And hes still on the other
side Im going to have a quick look Somebody
 And I send Frumpkin further in
 At this point I cant send in I can only
watch but I did tell him to go So what would
you well its up to you what Frumpkin would
interpret that as
 Well I think what weve established
 I can view but I cant give commands But I
said to go in so its up to you what
 That is oh for Frumpkin So I need to go
to a different tag Thats a three
 Okay
 Who knows Maybe Fjord could swim down there
if we could get this gate open but
 Yeah but you are a bean pole
 Stocky
 How many stones do you weigh
 Theyre a pound each What are you talking
about Im talking about
 Remind me it just keeps going forward Oh
no Frumpkin no
 In the same way theres another large grate
at the end of the passage
 So a tunnel going forward
 Youre done
 I will go in the back but I will send
Frumpkin  or  feet in front of all of us and
conga line behind whoever is second to last
 With Frumpkin looking When Im looking
through Frumpkin Im blind yeah
 Wheres little Beau Little Beau is
missing
 Yeah
 I think Beau is offering to not let me fall
faceplant
 Also you have to train your animal to
harass mine
 You doubled down from the last campaign
didnt you
 Caleb is laughing quietly in the dark
 Ja okay
 Ooh thats good 
 I would whisper that into Beauregards ears
not being able to hear her and tell her to hold
the group up for a moment
 I describe the room I dont know whats in
there yet but somethings changing
 Three water passages and then two hallways
that are dry
 DM youre describing those platforms but
then there are passageways further leading in
 I mutter that to Beauregard
 This room looks kind of fucked up We should not
rush into it
 Its eerie but do I see any living
creatures or threats
 My cat doesnt see anything but I dont
trust that theres are you listening to me
 Tap me on the shoulder if youre listening
to me Okay Ow God We dont see anything but I
have a bad feeling
 Frumpkin come back The room ahead is not
good
 No Theres something of a magical nature up
there
 Frumpkin would have seen that as would I
 Its glowing
 Well yeah but youre assuming that
nothings going to happen when you get into the
room or close to the room
 I am hearing a lot of what ifs
 Im casting Mage Armor
 
 Matt Im putting Frumpkin in this corner
 Yeah that was our lineup
 Yeah got to roll for initiative
 Bong rip this shit
 Yeah definitely 
 And we got plenty of light in this room
correct
 Oh  Sorry
 Go for the sky Ash
 Oh man
 Sick Matt Sick
 Were so happy
 We won we won
 
 I get pushed even though I saved
 Flipping somersault up in the air
 Like Zsa Zsa
 Yeah Whats that power Tal
 Grog is gone
 Okay so Caleb springs up out of the water
and I think from where I am I have a direct line
of sight to that corner that he just went around
yeah Because theyve got light up there
 Yeah I am pulling out the bat shit and the
sulfur and I am going to slap them together and
alle A Fireball is going to shoot across the
room into that square just to the left
of him my left which means it should get all three
 It is a 
 
  fire damage
 I will walk  feet backward into the tunnel
Im in  I will walk  feet
backward
 Oh surprise motherfucker
 Are you a fan of Matisse
 Heres a question nobody called dibs on the
dodecahedron today Could one of us since nobody did
 So we just got to say every game we just
have to make sure that we spit it out Okay so I
fail I got a seven
 Im out
 Oh Im not out because I have Mollys
necklace
 Although Im underwater
 Plus two
 Right Im unconscious and holding my
breath
 I think thats the way to go
 Yeah
 I also have a question about the Periapt It
says that whenever you roll oh its rolling a
hit die to regain hit points but it doesnt count
when anyone heals me
 Cthulhus dick
 So what do I do Concentration check death
save I dont know
 That is a six
 So thats two
 Mmhmm
 Just do whatever feels right
 All right
 Well there are dragons in this world
 Sure
 I have faith in you Jester
 He was dead
 No thats at a melee attack
 Yeah
 Hes a big guy
 Wilhelm scream
 Thats what Id do
 Oh fed him a potion
 It shoots under the water
 Strength saving throw Natural 
 Thanks Pike die
 Yep just deepthroated it
 Just got to relax
 Hey
 I got knocked for failing
 And whats the initiative order Its Fjord
then
 Could you clarify a rule for me because
Ive never tried to do this as a new magic user
newish but to do a bonus action firstlevel
spell could that be done in addition to a second
Or a third I know theres a version of being able
to cast two spells at once if ones lower than the
other but I cant remember what it is
 And a cantrip Okay so forget that
 Not interested So Caleb pushes up and if
were in difficult terrain what can I move like
five feet or something
 Two squares Uh I cant see shit
 Im going to move Im going to press right
up behind Jester right here What Im hoping to
do is to pull out the same batshit and sulphur and
rub it in my hands really quick and then set my
hands down on her shoulders to help me aim and
careen a Fireball to hit theres no wall there
because its invisible but to hit the ceiling
above cant reach Hit the ceiling here so I
can go bip bip bip to him but hopefully nobody
else
 Yeah From the ceiling down to him
 Back corner of the room
 Yeah
 I think Im at  Let me just
doublecheck Okay yep
  Okay so ten points of fire
damage
 Also Frumpkin is going to go five ten 
 Like that Underwater
 So hes thinking about it
 
 Half of a lot
 Calebs out
  Oh my god 
 The waters going 
 Yeah what do you want to do
 Oh shit
 Theyre hidden from all the rest of our
views right
 Im going to start covering distance
 Were all watching
 Im going to attempt to do that thing Ive
seen Beauregard do so many times and foof up my
biceps and look intimidating
 Yeah
 Although to play devils advocate you are
try to get revenge on you or your mother
 Im also curious to know what he is doing
down here in the first place
 I would like to throw my hat in the ring to
say that I think he might need to die here ja
 Just put a pin in it and see what we find
out here
 Period
 Tortles wear skorts
 Well Herr Clay do you need healing
 Yeah what about yourself
 I could use some I dont know if you are
sharing
 On the count of three One two
 Lets just sit here until its Crash Pandas
tomorrow
 Spam it
 Fjord ask him if knowledge of that water
creature that was here and is gone now if that is
known all the way to the top or is it his bag
or
 Ja and I send Frumpkin whos holding his
breath schlooping up on top of his chest Hes
hungry and so am I

 Ja and what happens to the commerce in
the city now that you have fucked that up
 Frumpkin starts to lovingly gnaw with his
beak on the upper chin of Algar
 I have a cloak
 No its a beak
 I take a good long look at it
 Great now I have to remember that as well
 Its in Is it in
 And rifle through the papers on the desk
 Do you still look like him
 I dont know did I find anything
 Ja okay Ooh ten
 Are you righthanded or lefthanded
 But two hours ago were you righthanded or
lefthanded
 Its very sad So sad that he had to sit
down and write a letter about how he had to leave
the city and how he had to free the creature
beneath the city because it was so wrong
 Hes leaving
 I was joking I said Glintshore
 Lay out on the glass
 I hear Opash has a sweet Airbnb on an
island
 Im sick of you people pushing me
around
 Its maybe its gilding the lily
perhaps
 Lots of middle fingers youll never catch
me alive your city is shit
 We can take care of the guards
 A water creature
 Its like a remote control car that spins
 Yeah were still in the office are we not
 While Jester is writing I would like to
flip this office for anything of value
 Oh just the papers
 Excellent
 Draft number two
 If you were fleeing in terror would you
stop to write a letter
 But he was the one that had all the sailor
tricks to get the boat
 I agree with you Jester I think we should
stick with Go fuck yourself
 Maybe something like choke upon your woe
 Or eat fecal matters
 Take a hit of the dodec
 Did you roll twice
 Angry writer
 Are we now Bane
 Thats unclear at this point isnt it
 Do you have that letter by the way Who has
that
 The letter that mentions Marius LePual
 Caleb wouldve remembered that too I
dont though
 I am very interested in that tower but I
would love to ask some more questions around town
before assailing it
 Have I ever read about anything like this A
building that seems to shift in size
 Ten
 Okay
 Dont look at me
 Oh its fascinating We learned that
whoever owns this place owns the district isnt
that correct
 So someone in this district probably knows
something about the person who owns the district
 Yeah
 Correct
 Well there was no marking for a tower
 No idea
 Just raw intelligence
 That is a 
 That diagram wasnt elaborate enough for me
to know the answer to that
 I spiffed up my clothing again as well
 This ones name is Bluute
 Not Bluute but Bluude
 With a D okay
 Oh so were no longer with Marion
 Okay
 You know I had the same thought Really
either she believes Jester and no big deal or she
doesnt believe Jester and knows that its taken
care of
 Jester feels like that perhaps she is
imposing bringing all of us here and we are
trying to convince her that that is silly
 Frau Lavorre you have such a lovely
daughter Shes so charming and such a spitfire
It has been such a pleasure to get to know her
Ive been curious for weeks now almost months I
think its been almost months what she was like
as a child because shes such a joy now
 So she was always a prankster
 Caleb summons Frumpkin the octopus and I rub
his head like a Bond villain staring at Beau
 Perhaps Nugget could live here and you could
visit him when you come home
 Third times the charm
 Were fucking Hermione Granger up in this
shit
 Did Orly say specific docks
 Yes Yes
 Weve got lamplight on the streets to
varying degree
 Wise as fuck
 Episode  something
 Yeah While all that was happening Im
halfway through as a ritual spell casting Find
Familiar so I can change Frumpkin to something
else
 Ill tell you in a minute
 Sorry Laura
 Because Caleb is on the ground going
 Also has ten minutes gone by
 You didnt correct me but I said while Nott
was foofing around so some time passed Five ten
didnt but youre the DM
 I know that I am so close to the end of the
spell and I am going to push through
 Ja
 Matt before you run off for the thing can
you describe as Caleb shakes his head out of what
he was doing what do I see I havent paid
attention to any of that
 Its going to all be in front of me I love
this game
 Bellyflop shitty dolphin Masterpiece
Theatre
 Whoa Holy fuck this is the best map youve
ever made
 I assume Find Familiar has fizzled
 Its a good thing we rested up and waited
until the following night though
 Sprayingmantis would fit in at our table
 Zwlf 
 Madness
 Tell us about your patron Fjord

 Come on Fjordy
 
 Yes hes puffy pants
 On brand
 I think I cast Mage Armor before going down
to the Sluice but how much later is it Is it
beyond eight hours
 Well Ill cast Shield So they miss
 Yeah okay I start moving my hand in an
arcane motion and I reach back at that building
over to my side there and a crate full of food a
wooden crate starts to jiggle and rockets through
the air at the held fool in front of Beauregard
Im casting Catapult at third level
 He automatically fails his dex save because
he is paralyzed d
 A couple things  points of damage Thats
a transmutation spell so I can shuttle a little
bit of arcane energy into my Transmuters Stone
and Im going to change its property from dark
vision into advantage on concentration checks Im
going to back the fuck up towards that house as
far as I can go
 Yeah
 Theres five people we can see one dude in
the boat down below
 Sentinel babes
 Shes going to carve him like a Thanksgiving
turkey
 Another layer of insanity
 Come on monk Come on M Aw you didnt
come on
 Pretty harsh woman
 Whatever Mama wants Mama gets
 Just look through our  rules here wait
a second
 Do you resurrect him 
 I guess
  It doesnt matter anyway
 Yes it was That was a good move
 Okay so factoring in a couple of things
One is that I see my friend Beauregard getting
hammered on by them which I do not like Also I
heard some voice from the boat yell out Burn
it so out comes the bat guano and sulfur and
slap and a beam rockets out foot range to
about here and erupts
 Yeah Vox Machina is gone The point is to
get it to a range where I know that its not going
to affect them on the dock Its going to hit the
boat
 Yeah absolutely What am I a surgeon I
have a rdlevel spell because I used arcane
recovery back at the chateau
 I also took a poop while at the chateau but
I thought I didnt
 
 I will use my movement to step around the
corner of the house and I will begin to count to
 slowly in Zemnian to calm my nerves
 I dont know if Caleb is a firebug or if I
am
 Theyre still standing
 The guy came out and said Burn all the
slaves
 Oh Those are two bad dice rolls
 Fjord pulls out the big guns Master plan
here it is
 Fuck yeah
 Bone it
 Shes back
 No 
 We just flip this Were going to jack this
fucking boat and get out of here
 Ladies and gentlemen

 Life is disappointing eh
 Way far away
 No you wont No you wont
 Okay I see which way the wind is blowing I
mutter a few arcane words and I cast the spell
Expeditious Retreat which is a transmutation
spell so I will also send a little bit of arcane
energy to the Transmutation stone to give myself
extra speed as well
 I can use my action my movement and my
bonus action to move full movement at 
So Vax is back
 I am now on the boat
 Transmutation spell gets my movement up to
 Right

Action movement plus now Expeditious Retreat
is a bonus action
  plus  plus 
 A red blur goes  and I am
standing next to Beauregard on the boat
 Are we stealing the boat
 Way to build that tension
 Into the abyss
 Oh man all in one movement Thats
 Vox Machina is dead long live Vox Machina
 Yeah oh man
 Sure but this is our MO
 Hey Matt that white ring is just leftovers
right
 My turn I give the Glove of Blasting a good
tug and I send three arcs of fire up into the air
and they spiral around each other and crash down
onto the dock about five to ten feet behind that
illusion and blast into the dock
 Thats a 
 Okay  Seconds a natural one
 Other one is way high natural 
 Low rolls
 damage
 Okay I will use my movement to  inside
the boat
 Can I use a cantrip
 Oh no I dont never mind Never mind
Getting the hang of it Good good good Done
 Fuck those idiots
  That was interesting That was
really great
 Frumpkin is not there
 Ja I rub a bit of honey across my lip and
say Mein Freund I suggest you throw down your
weapons and lie under that desk just for your
safety and I cast Suggestion
 I would like to use movement to zip up to
the top and look around
 You mean climbing under the desk
 I use my movement to zip up and look around
and my bonus action to zip back down into the boat
 Possibly burning
 Hes got the cardboard arrow spinning it
 Is he Kaijusized
 Who could have predicted this

Marius is just standing there held by a goblin
going Ah
 Oh you want this seafaring knowledge What
can you give me
 Thats a bad idea
 Did he just break it is that what Caleb
saw
 Hes got to do it
 Right
 I just want to clarify I thought that I had
told him to throw down his weapons and hide under
the desk for his safety Thats not an ongoing
thing
 But you dont go down and then immediately
stand up and get out again do you
 Oh he saved from the spell
 Hiding under the table for six seconds is a
shitty job at hiding but okay
 Okay thats fine I have to totally rethink
everything so give me ten seconds I will use my
action to run forward and with the edges of my
coat put out the burning papers
 Do I see anything As Im doing this yeah
if Im looking at it
 Okay thats it Im done I would say that
probably what I wouldve done not knowing any of
that is zip up to go up and then see if the door
is shut and go and thats the end of my turn
 Yeah I was casting Find Familiar
 So brave
 Theres torches for now
  feet off the dock
 Wow Fjord
 Look at that old fucker out there
 Oh its that kind of city
 You assume Im down there I guess
 Yeah I turn to the guy who he picked up
his weapons by now
 Yeah okay I reach out and use Catapult
and a drawer pulls out of the desk and slams into
the back of his head
 Dex save for that
 Okay its a failure so that is d
  points of bludgeoning damage
  I am standing next to Fjord and
Beau
 Feels good man
 Hes the only one having a worse day than
us
  Hey
 A miracle
 Heroes
 Oh my goodness Okay I will go down after
Jester and stand behind her to see what the
situation is with my movement
 Oh goodness I dont want to set the I
say Hey Why dont you put down that weapon and
lets talk about this and I cast Friends which
would be a disadvantage Im sure You have
very dangerous Youre going to die probably
sooner rather than later unless you want to talk
shop
 Persuasion with disadvantage
 Straight
 Seven Shit Thats persuasion ten
 I dont want to burn with the boat
 This is fucking fun
 Stress of the moment
 Thats all we know is his name
 What were you doing on the docks this
evening
 I would like to point out that youre
trapped on this boat with us
 Tomorrow my blue friend is going to if we
need to cast a spell on you and make you tell us
everything we want to know Why waste that time
 
 Her reputation keeps her from coming in
What is her reputation
 That is a good question
 What can you cook Thats interesting
 No
 Maybe youll earn your way to that well
see
 We did not know about Avantika or her ship
 We didnt know anything about her
 Calebs heading down to start searching
 Were like a quarter of a mile out to sea
 Yeah it was so much fun
 Nicodranas
 Well you know all told I think that went
very well It couldve been worse they attacked
us unprovoked I know that we were not exactly
normalseeming to them but we did not get
threatening with them They made the first move
and it just unraveled from there what can you do
Sometimes you just have to follow the cabbages in
front of you
 What did you say
 I will go down as well
 Is it better to pull it out or leave it in
place
 Were just going to leave hole in his head
like Phineas Gage
 Im just going to move the axe head a
centimeter or two
 As soon as Cads hands start to glow I yank
the axe out of his head
 Caduceus is America tonight
 Jester this is your axe
 Ja
 Well buddy were at sea now We are not at
the dock any more You are trapped with us We
have questions and I dont want to alarm you None
of us want to put an axe in your head or anything
 Right we want to just get along Were all
tired Im tired but Ill go to work if I need to
 
 The easy route is what Im talking about
Good decision
 We have a lot of questions so tell us
everything
 Gesturing to the desk and all the burned
we cant read anymore
 Like
 Take care of him I pull out the book and I
begin to do the ritual for Comprehend Languages
to see if that will help with the code Its a long shot
but Ill give it a shot
 Im doing a ritual spell for  minutes
 DD
 Oh wow so it spread out blank from thats
cool
 The code was where You said there was a
code I thought
 Yeah it takes tenish minutes to do
Comprehend Languages and if Im touching
 It is ten minutes plus one minute as a
ritual So yeah
 Casting time
 one action plus ten minutes
 Youre talking about a place an island a
building
 And youve made this trip yourself
 What are the risks one would encounter
trying to traverse this area
 Oh
 Did my spell trigger yet
 Only because I want to say the name as it
is is fairly appropriate We might want to change
it to change up our appearance and stuff Do
you know what Mist means in Zemnian
 It means shit
 Yeah manure Crap it means crap Its
pretty on brand for us honestly
 Youve been doing it for several months now
Jester
 Were going to add on to Mistake is funny
too I like that Can I read this code
 Okay See these squiggles here This is
either just supplies or maybe they are trying to
make booby traps for their island I dont know
 Little ridge that hes not used to
 Do you have any weapons left on you
 Does he have it now or has he chucked it
 Thats water under the bridge We just dont
want any new problems yeah And theres a lot of
us here so it would be foolish to do anything
right
 You just got a comeup
 You got a new pet
 Thaddeus Klossowski von Musel
 Then youll have two balls
 You recognise those specific points there
 We came here for the two of you What are
you after
 Why would we not want to go to this place
 Yeah north is that way and I point north
 Or you could put Zemnian and Common together
and make it the Shitake if its the Mistake
 Does someone need to man the ship at night
when most of us are sleeping
 Can we do that without any sailing
experience
 How far off
 The other thing we could do is find a place
on the Menagerie Coast a good ways away from where
we departed and some of us could try to find a
crew Also we left the cart behind
  Saved by the Bell style
 I wander over
 What do you mean that they started it
 No Im good
 Today was not optimal by any means but we
have helped our friends mother and she is better
off The things on the dock did not go great no
one would use the word great but we did not draw
a blade on them or do anything they attacked us
We kept ourselves alive we kept our friends
alive I did not expect us to be departing
Jesters hometown quite so quickly but here we
are Were all alive were helping another one of
our friends This is not our home
 I would not say that we have shit on
everyone elses
 Which part specifically troubles you most
Is it the fact that the town might be without
power for a little bit
 They can adapt They have to adapt People
have to adapt And that creature down there hes
doing better You cant have a society built on
slavery
 Well there were a lot of innocent people in
that death hole and theyre alive because of you
Jesters mother is better off because of you
Alfield is better because of you you have done a
lot of good
 Well they attacked us
 Well we cant leave without a crew
 This works out for you you were going to
get a boat
 Know where you want to go
 These crackers are terrible
 Thats why its a bad cracker
 Who here cannot change their appearance
You Thats it
 Okay Youve got the boat
 We would be exhausted
 What about pulling into a cove outside of
the city a couple of miles and walking in
 We can either pull the name off of the boat
or alter it
 I am too
 Quiet subterfuge instead of loud subterfuge
which is what weve been doing
 Maybe the crew turned on their captain and
killed him on the docks and fled with his ship ja
 Fjord can the boat just be adrift if a
couple of us stay up in shifts to make sure that
there are no enemies
 None of us know how to steer this thing
except for Fjord
 I think we just need to cool it
 Why are you talking so funny
 Sit up with me for a little bit Well take
the first shift
 You Nott the Brave
 Yeah late morning Can I just take a moment
with my goblin friend while theyre sleeping
 Come here look I want to show you
something
 You want a piggyback
 Skitter up
 You see the sun is coming up but you can
still see one or two up there You see that one
 Thats a planet that one Thats another
place
 Today was a major clusterfuck Everything
went wrong We did all the wrong things
 No But do you know what worries me more is
the feelings Im getting from everyone in the
crew Theyre a little despondent All of them
 I know that it didnt go very well but
this is our new family right We want the family
to stick together I think we need to oh youre
over here I think we need to lead by example
 Keep their morale up I think is all I
mean We have done good things I know that the
day was it was a day But we want this to keep
going
 We care for these people ja
 We definitely need to think more than just
wing it you know This group we get under each
others skin and we all egg each other on and we
like to wing it so maybe we need to slow things
down But I am serious the thing that I am
worried most is they feel like its fracturing
and we cannot let that happen
 Also are you mad about the swimming thing
 Tell you when Im going to mess with your
head a little bit
 I thought it would help
  Theyre losing their cool
 I dont know if youre joking or not but
Im going to do it
 And there really is another world
 Fine
 Its a perception 
 That was good work
 I dont know couldnt the name of this boat
be on a ledger or something somewhere
 But also The Mist is printed on the side
of the boat We have not changed that have we
 Youre an artist
 How close to the shore do we get with the
ship The ship proper
 You picked a sailor man
 Jester has fixed the sail
 Also the Fireball went off the side of the
ship so the edge of the ship would be burned
 Okay
 The dockmaster is the one person whos in
charge of the whole area
 How about mac n cheese
 I would say that I look like a somewhat plump
good Zemnian boy blond and a little rounder
 Ja a little bit
 Dont make me run Im full of chocolates I
saw Fjord talking to the wharfmaster so I will
wait until Fjord is finished and then I will go
up and talk to him as well
 Excuse me we have been doing very well on
our travels at sea and we are looking to share
the duties and want to hire a bigger crew I know
theres many docks around here but why wouldnt I
start here of course Do you know is this a
good place is there anyone whos looking for work
right now Were going on a journey oh you know
three or four or five or six weeks perhaps
Onetime job
 Oh Im so sorry did you cover that
already
 Excellent
 For real though like a realworld Capn
Crunch
 Carpenter captain so we need a boatswain
 What came between boatswain and navigator
 Okay
 Seafloor Bounty
 Do you know what this is reminding me of
though Is getting the crew for our keep in the
last home game
 The rumor were trying to spread is what
they already think
 Yes more often than a hundred years
 Rumors only grow
 Find that navigator Did we find the rest
 Oh 
 I do not
 Was it within the last month Then you have
to tell me who it is
 She said Orly you didnt confirm it
 Yeah well walk there We need turtle
power
 Ja
 Offer money from the getgo
 Just say your messages you put it
 Your
friends from the other night Thats it
 Eight left
 Do you know who youre talking to We all
look different from the last time that we have met
 We came to see you we talked about that
we a man named
 We like the look of you We have a good job
and big money
 A week yeah its
 Well I have  gold
 A full Scottish send off when we leave
 It breathes better in open space
 Nice nice nice
 Rose gold
 Roads Its just like roads Off roading it
or roading it
 Sure
 Theres tentacles on the map
 TGIF flair is all that is
 Ja of course We are The Mighty Nein not to
be trifled with Welcome to The Mighty Nein Caduceus
 No she means your hands
 Could it just be talk For instance there
is a rumor of a ghost girl on the docks back in
the Menagerie Coast we heard circulating
 This thing that you want to do this mission
Im sorry I overheard last night is there a
place that it needs to happen or is it something
that you will do wherever you go on the road
 Beep
 Mutiny
 Wow this quinoas pretty good
 
 The perception check was for at night during
a shift
 All throughout the whole day okay
 Could we say that Beau and
 Look at Fjord He is the captain now
 One quick thing
 You know I want to thank you You could
have told any of these people anything about me
and you have not
 I know You have every right to I hope you
dont I dont know how all of them would handle
it Be that as it may I have something for you
 I bring Frumpkin out in his new speckled elf
owl form which is the smallest owl on the planet
He weighs one ounce
 The tiniest little owl that ever existed
This is a loaner
 You can have him for roughly a week
 No this is the way owls are supposed to be
I place him Hes going to listen to you
 Yeah
 A couple rules He will listen to you Will
you listen Frumpkin Frumpkin nods Okay If you
need to get him out of danger in a hurry you
say split Thats what it will take Youll need
me to bring him back but if hes in danger and
you want to keep him for your week loaner you say
split Okay Hes yours Thank you Yeah
 Oh hey Rub a little phosphorus on and
send a globule of light  feet in every
direction from the boat four of them to see if
theres anything
 Mattll do it
 Weve been doing therapy talks for two and a
half hours Matt has to wake up now Were on combat
 Nein Oh no I was saying no in German
excuse me I did not roll a nine
 Ja Five
 
 Im sure some stuff was added to the ten
 How far up the mast could you say I could
climb with my movement Is that half speed
 Okay
 How high does the mast go
 Nevermind I will stand at the mast and I
will pull a white feather out of my coat and trace
a baleful glyph in the air and cast Fear and they
must make a wisdom saving at 
 Anything within  feet of Caleb
 Enemies
  wisdom save
 Yeah thats it
 Auf Wiedersehen
 They have to be out of line of sight If
they can see theres me on the boat
 Thats what the spell says
 See ya
 You motherfucker
 Max damage
 Bop bop
 Yeah high rolls
 Come on Beauregard
 Caleb clutches his chest and cries out and
falls to the floor of the boat 
 Ja sure
 Its pretty good 
  Thats not what I was expecting
 Oh thank goodness You know Im such a
fearful person
 Im always getting scared of things and that
one was too much for me
 I look over at Nott
 Caleb is beet red Beet red Face matches
his hair
 No we just need to not be attacked by
anything anymore we need to just stop pursuing
our pursuits and pick an island and stay there
 I feel pretty good I feel like
 This is feeling like its going too far
Nott
 Is it hot Feels hot
 Some bone broth maybe
 I rolled for him last week and he
appropriately only has one hit point
 Take a huff
  Dead men tell no tales
 I am not able to do that
 I start working on Leomunds Tiny Hut Its
going to take some time
 Ten minutes  minutes yeah
 Correction for me not  minutes 
minutes Still doing it
 Im making the tiny hut but I dont know
how much time has passed while I was peeing
 A tenfoot radius immobile dome of force
springs into existence around and above you and
remains stationary for the duration Environment
or weather cant get in so thats up to you if
the ocean can get in or not
 It is totally transparent All of us can
look through it and see into the ocean
 Eight hours
 I can certainly  minutes in advance get
it going again As long as I can focus indefinitely
 The white flag
 Yeah no more Grog
  Yeah
 Boats in New York
 Just lost the southern tip
 You heard it here Next week in New York
live on stage
 Your shipping dreams and your shipping
dreams are coming true
 Yeah
 From down below inside the bubble of
Leomunds Tiny Hut I pull out the wire and I cast
bottom of the ship so I think our troubles are
behind us now

 Yeah Im inside a giant sphere of glass
basically
 No I cannot do that I have to stay here in
this bubble or the boat will sink presumably
 Well it lasted between ten and  minutes
while I got this going but I am not a boat
expert Thats Fjords MO so I cant say for
certain how long this will stay afloat no
 Nein I cannot do that but I could walk
away from this Are we all leaving There are
actually pirates above
 Okay I am trying to process this as quickly
as I can Im glad that I spent all the time
making this Lets go fuck it I walk out of
Leomunds Tiny Hut It goes  gone
 Yeah As we go up topside I say quietly to
inside the bubble so its all the same to him
lets go
 Yeah and going up also I grab hold of that
leather thong thats tied around my thigh and I
cast Mage Armor on the way up
 Okay
 Tally ho
  Ha ha Youre so pretty
 Oh Phillip

 My name is Phillip Bonejour
 Were all going to die
 Just out of curiosity if I look back over
my shoulder do I still see a boat
 I hear her say that and for ten or 
seconds jump into Frumpkins vision to see what I see
 Hey guys lets steal a boat Itll be so
much fun

 Caleb died
 Are we off on our own a little bit from
everyone training guns upon us
 What is our plan here Im trying to move my
lips as little as possible We go with this for
the time being Then when the moment is right we
get away Or are we just pirates now

 I would warrant a guess that we are stuck
here for the time being but I think at a certain
point we are going to want to go and if that
happens all of you if you see a window in which
we can get away tell Nott or myself and we will
start a snow chain
 We will tell our friends that its time to
get out of here Just find you or me and we
spread it quickly so we dont leave anyone behind
like we almost fucked off without Caduceus from the docks
 I think for the time being we are in fact
pirates and that Fjord youre absolutely
correct learn as much as possible and when the
opportunity is right we leave but for now we
have to swiff them they are our new best
buddies
 Also glancing around for books
 Big 
 Yeah Im sorry you have a very thick
accent Sometimes it is

 Im losing a couple of things here and
there no offense
 Was I eating cheese
 My perception is so low

 I thought that was a metaphor
 I have a good sense of it
 Caleb is in the background pulling cheese
from the wall

 Well clarifying question did Avantika just
watch Fjord yell at Nott That shit is in my body
 I want to know
 You beat me to that by like  seconds
 Yeah absolutely this is an advantageous
moment for all of us If we can help you and your
hentai cult achieve your goal

Well all come out as winners This is true if my
name is Philip
 Yes Jumanji Costco clear as day
 The tradition continues
 Also if were leaving the chamber and there
were all those people outside with the Percy sticks
 Yeah if theres any out maybe theres not
but the thing Im going to do leaving is to try to
subtly get a good look at size what I think they
are capable of
 
 Can I see at least is it this or this
 Oh okay
 So most everyone here is packing then
 I feel like we are learning a lot about you
right now and not from you Are we alone

 I pull out the wire in view of everyone and
that you maybe want to tell us about that you
havent already
 Well I would have to ask the DM I dont
know about this That bubble I dont know if it
is soundproof at all because I just got that
spell
 I dont think it is
 Yeah I would
 Well you were upstairs so only if youre
screamers
 You have Im speaking very quietly amongst
Jesters whispers
 You have been having
 This is an ongoing dream that you have been
having
 Three or four times you have had a dream
with a thing that has a giant eye like the one on
your sword and like the inner motifs of this
womans office
 Yeah okay Were you able to summon a scary
transparent tentacles before that explosion on the
boat and those dreams happened
 Were you vomiting seawater before you had
those dreams Or making a sword come out of the
palm of your hand before that explosion
 No judgements here but is it safe to say
that you have been undersharing with us
 Every single thing
 Seems pretty relevant
 Yes this was my next question I
personally was thinking about getting the hell
out of here but
 We are here for you and you want to
understand what is happening to you
 Yeah I think we are you know were
friends I think were trying to figure out where we
 We are friends
 But Addendum
 now we are friends with a giant
squid being with a giant eye so Im just trying to
 Ouroboros giant eyes lots of tentacles
 I mean weve all read stories of sea
creatures Im just vibing here go with me
The point is
 That is the point

 I think we are past the point of secrets
here
 We need to know what is what
 Not straight charisma
 The hunt for Fjords third ball continues

 Yeah this is too simplistic it could be
both
 For now we are allies
 For now we work together to figure out his
problem
 If we have to eventually 
 Is that a stealth on all of us too You
snuck out on us
 Is it a guy in like a Costco Tshirt
 Also in your ear very quiet you hear
 Oh
hey is everything okay Going well
 Calebs Alarm spell is going ding a ling a
ling
 Would you do me a favor just as a rule
maybe keep that ten feet away from me please
 No its useful just you know oil and
water
 He shit under the chair
 Why not both
 Before this goes any further because Im
fascinated
 I would like to attempt to go into Frumpkin
the oneounce elf owl if possible
 Yeah I remember where that room was so
Frumpkin is taking a little fly around
 I think theyre about to get naked
 Caleb cant hear any of this but in the
kinky in that room
 Its just so much you guys its just so
much
 I thought they were going to make bumsen
but it did not happen
 Question I am still watching her

 I know its confusing I like to stay inside
this Zemnian accent so much but I did not say
that out loud That was for the DM
 Yeah I did not stop watching her after he
left
 What is she doing
 Okay
 Just a ten
 So she did some arcane shit Did she also
look very hot and bothered
 Yeah well so after you you know made the
flirt talk that I was watching
 Oh they were both pouring it on pretty
thick
 Thats a subjective thing my friend
Anyway she is very interested in you and after
you left her room I watched a little bit longer
and she did some cutting She dropped a little bit
of her blood on a miniature altar or something Do
you do this
 Yeah she stood on a stool and she did a
little
 She seemed very maniacal is the word that I
would choose She seemed very driven
 I mean it sounded like she wanted power and
a lot of it
 Fjord if we venture into this sticky
wicket do you share even in a small way similar
desires as this woman Do you want to control the
sea
 Well you are grappling with a great deal of
power we have watched you do it Are you trying
to understand this thing better be free of it
master it
 Yeah I place the elf owl back on
Beauregards shoulder and go to sleep
 Also why did you talk so funny for a
moment
 You sounded like you had a different accent
for a moment there Fjord
 Except that I pull Beau back while everyone
proceeds upstairs
 Speaking as a massive liar I think he is
lying to us a little bit
 Sure One eye open
 I dont think he knows what he wants yet
 No Im the authority on knowing what I
want Beauregard
 He spoke with a different accent for a split
second
 Yeah to a purpose not when he is waking up
instantly
 Okay
 I walk upstairs
 I will walk behind Beauregard
 Also question
 What is the temperature like
here on this island Are we tropical at this point
 Caleb would then have taken his coat off and
twisted it up and tied it to the back of his coat
so hes just with the holstered books and his
shirt sleeves rolled up at this point since its
so hot
 No I just tied it onto the back of my pack
 Rolled it up like a carpet
 Gesundheit
 
  Theyre not saying anything
 May I have a look at this one
Not the rubies
 Are there any runes on this
thing does it seem arcane in nature
 Yeah how does everyone feel about a
tenminute breather here I sit down and unholster
my book and begin to cast Identify as a ritual
 No One at a time
 Do you have a quicker way
 Its only ten minutes
 Yeah this sucks
 Nott heres your toy back
 Was all of that for all to hear or are they
off a bit
 Yeah Im good Break time over
 
 Natural 
 I would also say as were tromping through
that I would push forward and try to catch up with
Jamedi momentarily Oh jeez what is that
 Excuse me two questions for you
 Whats that How much further A days
travel or more than one day until we reach our destination
 And did you encounter any kind of threats
 Anything specific that we should be on guard
for or prepared for
 You mentioned that
 You avoided them you did not tangle with
them yourself
 Makes sense I cast Mage Armor right in
front of him on myself Thank you See you later
Im going back to my earlier position
 You said its also darker now As I chew on
some liquorice root
 While that is going on I walk over and
you hang out with me for a moment
 Excellent lets stand right here I
casually pull out the wire and I cast Message to
Nott Nott would you please go I need you to
speak to Avantika and Jamedi together for a
moment please
 Ja
 Just distract them please
 After a moment passes I stand behind
Caduceus tall frame and quietly cast Detect Magic
 Even for Jamedi
 Oh I need to walk up and learn more about
this dance then
 Oh Ja verstehen okay
 I still want to see what hes carrying
 What are you two doing over here Youre
holding up We need to move
 I try to catch up to him
 I pass them by Try to catch up
 I creep up to just about  feet away
 I quickly turn around and through the wire
here Looking in the distance at them and at
Jamedi
 Before this spell fades
 
 Roughly how far away is that fray
 Also do I see anything glowing on Jamedi
 Okay
 The path that they took away does it line
up or deviate from the general direction that we
have been heading in
 Okay
 I have been spending this entire debate
looking north and remembering everything that I
saw on the way here from the boat and just
calculating an exit strategy because I remember
the things that I saw on the way here
  Or masturbate
 Good riddance
 No Im able to affect its color and have it
match It still looks like a very smooth bubble
that is feet tall maybe not that big but it
can match the general color
 Yeah it does not glow
 I spend the next  minutes I pull out the
book unholster it and start doing a ritual cast ja
 Leomunds tiny hut Is this where we want to
do it Jester
 Okay just a little longer then
 Do we want it just to be us and they have
the tent
 At the surroundings here or what were
behind a little bit of stone ruins or
 Then its gray the same color as the stone
I have control of the color Also out of
curiosity I am a transmutation wizard so do I
have a sense of how old the stone surrounding us is
 Ugh bad roll 
 The thing is if I exit this bubble now
then it goes away
 I could do it again
 They went to do a perimeter sweep
 The good news is were totally safe in this
bubble and nothing can happen to us
 Vier
 Four
 Six seconds Done
 He doesnt know barbarians
 I drop the hut its gone
 Seeing what I see Ive got the transmuter
stone I can see in dim light so Im feeling into
my satchel and I take out some molasses and smear
it on my hands and cast Slow on Ill come as far
as I can over here behind Yasha to see what I
can see
 I will come this way not getting closer to
them Yeah thats fine Thats good And cast
Slow on the two creatures that I see
 DC 
 Yeah
 No no apologies
 If I have any movement left I will back
away from that shit
 Palms are sweaty
 You just roll your eyes at us at this point
That made me so happy
 
 Caleb is going to quickwalk over to
Avantika kneel down and say Are you all
right with his back to Spaghetti and cast
Identify on one of the swords
 Okay My back is to him
 It was almost a one but it wasnt Thats
pretty good Its 
 The rapier
 Pat the cheeks
 Were good
 Its gone but it only takes me  minutes
I dont know are we safe where we are
 Did they seem like intelligent beasts
 Thats better Thats a 
 Still animalistic
 Knowing that I would recommend that if I
make the bubble again even if some more of them
come as long as we stay safe for the next ten
minutes if they come we will be still and
sleeping and all they would see is a round stone
Theyre animals they will leave
 I will begin my ritual spell in the same
spot
 Mecca lecca hi mecca hiney ho
 Tenfoot radius so  from one side to the
other
 Ja Ill take the first shift Im good
Im very jittery tonight
 Frumpkin by the way is flitting about a
little bit from person to person while we talk
Even lands on Avantikas shoulder a little bit and
does a little
 Entschuldigung Im sorry Now the owl is
pitterpatting on Avantikas hat
 Not constantly but in a cute way
 Are you putting the umlaut over the os in
the poop Pyoop
 He flitters up to the finger
 He does whatever I say He bats his little
oneounce owl eyes at Avantika
 Frumpkin poops
 One Also were being very quiet because we
dont want to be heard but while were in here
Frumpkin over a period of ten or  minutes you
see this goes  along the ground
and hops onto Avantikas boot
  Eventually stands on top
of her dagger and I cast Identify through touch
of my familiar And he weighs one ounce
 Oh Im sure its terrible Hold on a
second
 I am It is 
 Why did you do that
 You know why I did that
 Ey
 Okay Dont mind me while I make another
owl I begin casting Find Familiar to bring back
Frumpkin as a oneounce owl

 I promised Beauregard an owl for a week so
I cant have my cat back Ten minutes later
theres an owl Watch is over
  I like cats
 Yeah
 Ja you can go out and in and you can
sorry You can put your weapons through it but no
magic will go in or out But you can leave and
come back anytime you want
 But please dont go on any walkabouts while
we are sleeping
 But you already did
 Do you promise
 That is good enough for me Good night
 
 To be fair we all had Indian for dinner
tonight so it could be any one of us
 Its a slow roll laughter It took a minute
and then it caught like fire

 Hm
 Yeah okay
 Okay well say the word and Ill pull it
down
 Do the running man in the mud Beau
 Owl on your head
 Youve got mono
 Yeah Natural  plus 
 The blessing
 Woo
  Maxed out Jeez
 
 Its somewhere in the building Well find
it
 And we are hanging back at this point but
not in the thick of it Were seeing this all from
a distance I was thinking about spells Yeah
 Im ritual casting through this discussion
 Comprehend Languages
 Its just Ed
 I did not prepare the spell to disguise
myself I thought we would be fighting monster
people so
 What
 Are you Marisha or
 Comforting
 What do we think that these beings reaction
will be to not lizardpeople being on this island
all of a sudden
 You think its an every day or every week or
month occurrence I think were probably pretty
special here
 I think that if anyone that looks like me or
you shows up on this island anyone who sees it
is going to come asking questions immediately
 And the clothes weve seen on these people
are like what Theyre purple robes youve mentioned
  I begin to put ugh my spell
books into Fjords bag
 Yeah I cant have ornate book holsters
and ugh Trying to make myself look as simple as possible
 I had that spell once
 Ill look like a s Halloween costume
Come on
 Make me look like Spiderman
 You look pretty convincing How do I look
 What do you mean what did you say
 Is that better
 I lean in way in to Notts ear and say

 Oh by the way Caduceus says that
Jamedi is actually a dead thing
  I was telling Nott that Jamedi
is a dead thing Caduceus says Jamedis dead
  Keep it on the DL
  Are you whispering too
  We dont have a choice
  What if we let the pirate queen
tie rocks to our feet and were dead We have to
do this We can kill them later
 Weve seen you flit about
 Yeah
 
 Rogues man rogues
 So an intersection to go through to get to
the right turn past it
 Dont you listen to her
 Im going to go listen to your tapes your
level seven tapes
 Its just the bottom of the structure that
curves around
 I cast Comprehend Languages
 Abyssal
 Youre going to take a dive
 Distraction is them
 Yeah actually we should chase them and
kill them because they could actually snap out of
it at any second
 Yeah thats right
 Ja They would kill us we watched them
skinning the inhabitants of this
 Are we in a stone room
 Is there wood
 Fire Bolt
 Bolt
 
 Its d which is 
 Its all stone
 Seven
 Every week were like this is the episode
where we start thinking This is the one
 Fire Bolt
 Yeah Is he dead or is he unconscious
 Oh yeah Thats a 
 Its a 
 Its five
 Thats the sound it makes Phoomph
 How tall is this person whos just died
 Yeah
 Hes only four feet
 Okay I take out some iron and I go
 and he shrinks to an eighth of that
and I pick him up
 Yeah I dont want to leave him here
 Oh he went down there I thought he was at
our feet
 I would only do it if he was right where we
were
 
 Obviously for killing With all the reading
I have done can I ascertain or have a good guess
of what this is used for besides
 Yeah I know its for killing people but
does it do something To do something Summon
things make a god happy
 I have read many books
 I got a one
 Not my neighborhood
 Yeah Is it safe
 Im casting Mage Armor
 How steep
 So how fast does the fall feel
 So its not that far down
 I begin casting Slow
 Lets skip and go to the next episode
 Do I get any jump on that Slow spell I
tossed out at the last second of the episode
Yeah I said I start casting Slow and you said
Thats where well pick up next week
 Had to ask
 Shut up
 Six Here comes that Slow spell Fastball
special
 Mmhmm
 What just happened
 Heads off that corpse You cant put it
back
 Triplets down to twins
 You can quit barbarians any time you want
 Tell me when the Nein stops screaming
Clarice
 Things you never want to hear Matt say
 I was rummaging in my pockets for the
molasses but everybody is dropping so instead I
pull out a burned twig and hold my hand out and
cast Witch Bolt at rdlevel through the twig
towards snakeman
 That is a 
 Okay so thats d which I have never
used in my life I think its this one The fuck
is that Thats an  Plus six is  
lightning damage
 Which I did from the ground I guess so I
will stand up now Am I within five feet of that guy
 Hey Im going to run for it Im going to
go toward that pillar there
 Yeah
 Am I able to use Shield as a reaction if
Ive already cast a spell No correct Because
Ive not tried to do that so I dont know if its
allowed
 Per round Because as a rogue you could do
sneak attack damage and then on an attack of
opportunity you could do sneak attack damage
 Oh that hits
 Ooh Thats not too bad
 Did all Caleb hear with Comprehend Languages
is swear words
 Okay
 Slide that a little bit down
 Yeah
 Not at the moment
 Wait a moment Nott have a look around this
room Do you see anything problematic
 Ja Is there anything arcane in nature to
the writing on the sides of it or can I ascertain
the purpose of it This fountain
 Theres all kinds of people in this world
 Tune into All Work No Play this Friday
 What holes
 What are you doing over there I walk over
and I nudge her thigh and butt with my foot What
are you doing shouting in holes
 I dont think that is what that is
 Nobody noticed
 Its a simple thing if we have any kind of
wood or maybe some silver or copper coins to shove in
 Like arrow and crossbow bolts and things
like that use your noggin Or some coins and I
could turn them to stone and block up the holes
 Copper
 It would be stone swords I would imagine I
dont know We could shove as many
 I was thinking of jamming it full of a
material so its like a clot and then turning that
into stone
 I cant do that to dead people
 You know thats not a bad idea because I
could burn the flesh and it would fuse
 Yeah
 Well I could definitely inspect this Do
you want me to do that now though or maybe we
are pressed for time
 Were hanging here
 Because Im pretty beat up
  Youre a dead man
 Arcane recovery
 I have looked all around the fountain and
Im not able to make anything out
 Are they any seams or visible machinery or
cogs or anything
 Maybe Matt forgot the quality of Lesser
Restoration
 Thats the fastest way Up your butt
 Caleb looks around at everyone doing
absolutely nothing and sits down pulls out his
book and starts to Identify this ring to see if
anythings happening
 Five more minutes please
 Theres a yuanti woman hanging by her arm
off the wall
 I could do that Do we want to do that
Whats down there
 Eh let me borrow this Frumpkin flies just
down to the fountain
 I want to see if I bamf into Frumpkin if I
can hear anything below
 At advantage
 Because hes an owl and has advantage over
hearing Terrible both terrible rolls Eight
 Frumpkins back on your shoulder Okay Four
globules of light lower down to the fountain and
look over the side to see what that lights up
 Did you say how far to the bottom it
seemed
 Well Fjord is nudging at Caleb
 In answer to your quiet question I could
take the silver thread out and
 I could have helped okay Everybodys doing
things too quickly That thread will take me ten
minutes
 Thats ten minutes if we want to take it
key
 Jump just down the  feet
 You two are down the two of you
 Youre up at the top of the tower
 I cast Feather Fall on him and me and him
and Yasha
 On five people
 Choose up to five falling creatures within
range I guess I push the two of you as I fall
 I see him fall and I shove these two off and
I go 
 Thats a good one
 Does it burn when you pee
 Your eyes are normally like tea saucers but
now theyre like full plates Are you all right
 How much have you had from that bottle of
yours
 Theres already a merry go round of lights
going around Notts head
 Its like the sun in here
 Fivesided still
 Natural 
 What about entrances and exits
 Nott will you come with me please Never
mind Beau will you come with me please
 Ja theyre pouring bloody water down
here
 Entrances exits stonework writing I
think you said investigation
 
 Is there any blood in the wicker basket
 Lets hold on a second Its been less than
an hour If I put my hand oh wait no it hasnt
 Im going to start casting Comprehend
Languages again
 Feed me while Im casting
 Give me ten minutes Thats on the tablets
right
 That would punch in the ten minutes I need
to cast Comprehend so I will retrace all the
steps and place my hands on that writing to see
if it reveals its meaning to me
  Lights floating around
 Oh I didnt know that she sees it because
Oh I didnt know
 I do a lot of reading of spells and not a
lot of paying attention you guys
 So thats how you see it
 Hey I stole this ring from you
 Oh it echoes in here
 That is a  total
 That is a 
 Eastern wall
 I feel really good but I know
 Wait wait
 I know that I am not in a good position so
somebody come with me to make sure
 Blueberry come on
 Yeah I always know where north is so its
one of these ways
 He said south just now I thought you said
south East was the one that we hadnt checked out yet
 But I dont know which way I am going at the
moment so DM which way does my keen addled mind
tell me the direction I just went South
 South This one says The fountain feeds
the garden Oh we knew that part Okay Lets
keep looking at the okay whats this one
 Go to the west
 Ja
 The garden feeds the warden
 The warden sounds like a sentient Ooh I
feel good
 I always know which way north is so lets
go east
 Oh this is like a chain and if I wasnt
high as fuck I would get it The sacrifice feeds
the fountain
 Ja so this is Part A of the equation
Feeds the fountain The fountain feeds the garden
The garden feeds the warden The warden feeds the
snakes Lets go to the last wall The warden
guards the false serpent
 False serpent
 So there is a false serpent that lives here
and we have yet to meet the warden
 I think we have yet to meet the warden
 Oh
 Youre hurting my ribs
 I can tell that things are going very poorly
so I reach into my pockets and I pull out a bit of
iron dust and I go  and Jester doubles in
size
 Hey Oh
 You get advantage on strength checks and
strength saves right now so you can bust if
youre grappled
 At advantage because of Enlarge
 Yeah Technically
 There is vines on Jester down below
correct
 Im just sort of being shaken back and forth
by the blue giant and Im going to Im super
high throw a Fireball down at the vines below
Simple spell
 Bolt Not ball
 I dont have Fireball
 
 That is a  to hit
 But its just one so I was scared to go too
big and I just go 
 Its d
 Oh level five thank you
 Oh now its three
 
 Quickly Before this runs out
 Also Enlarge runs out and we crash on top
of Jester
 One minute
 Ooh I will turn your hand into gold
 That one says
 Your toilet guarded by the hemoglobins
 Wow thats almost a Matt Mercer callout
  Absolutely 
 I can feel my hair growing
 Is there any writing or anything in there
 Theyre not the warden can take care of
itself
 Pressing face against the crack on Do you
see Jester wants to know if you see a switch
 Do you need a globule or an owl
 Wow Wow wee wee wow wow
 Are you trying it
 Ja anything could happen right here
 Ja lets go unleash the big snake
 What who Who is
 Somebodys dead
 Fjord and Yasha are the tallest We put them
perfect
  Natural 
 I need to drop acid all the time
 Going into a battle high as fuck
 Is it pitchblack in there or is there a
light source
 A quick pitch would be really good
 No Im so high right now but I know that
that is not a good what is it
 What is that
 I cannot do that right now One I have not
prepared it Two Im really messed up
 I could also summon Schmidt
 To carry the keg over
 
 I did not bring anything nasty like that I
came to be a team player today like I always am Captain
 Do you have any
 Philip Do you have any ranged abilities as
a sneaky one
 Ja
 Anything that walks through there has to
float above the water or its going to disturb it
and alert
 Are you more coherent than me so that you
two can attack as one Because I have seen you do
a lot of damage when the enemy does not know you
are coming Could you go simultaneously
 Yeah you watch her and when her dupe goes
you go and then
 Oh theres so many of you right now
 Both of you same time
 Ja
 Caleb
 Yeah
  My anaconda dont My anaconda
dont
 Wow
 Does the dupe count as an ally though
 Unload it
 
 
 In your hand
 Im going to push forward through the
passage and peek over Jesters shoulders I can
see this guy partially hidden behind its too
early I give a tug to the glove of blasting and I
am sending out three Scorching Rays
 Is it pitch black still Theres no
 Its pitch black I have darkvision because
of the transmutation stone
 Oh its totally dark because of what you
just did
 I dont see it at all
 Shit I dont like this Balls Im going to
cast no I dont know where it is at all
 Yeah so I cant even aim at disadvantage
Okay What I am going to do is peek around the
corner and cast Haste on Beauregard
 Youre hasted
 I will step out back into the passage so Im
not in view
 Your dice look really good tonight
 Yeah totally
 Just waiting for the other shoe to drop
here
 Not knowing how Hadars works it doesnt
pierce that area though right
 A hydra
 Because of the Hadars
 Speed is doubled
 What about your extra attack
 Disengage and bolt
 Is each head a creature or is each head
a Never mind
 Ah Gott Im going to lean around the
corner and do what I thought I would do before
which is to tug on the Glove of Blasting and fire
the three Scorching Rays Natural  for the first
  for the second
 Very high for the third
    total
 I will jump back into the hallway because
Im a coward
 Your AC is two higher
 She didnt want an attack of opportunity
 Shes not Oh
 I thought she was right up Okay
 Fastball special
 Im going to do a little bit of a gamble
here I peek out again and I drop Haste on
Beauregard and smear molasses across my hand and
cast Slow on the hydra and his little snakey friend
 Slow They have to beat a  Theyve got
Bane or the hydras got Bane
 Yeah
  The Banes on hydra
 Come on motherfucker
  Fuck me
 Part of the Slow spell is that regardless
of the creatures abilities or magic items it
cant make more than one melee or ranged attack
during its turn Its lost all its head attacks
It gets one attack
 Cad
 Ive dropped Haste on you
 Ive Slowed the hydra
 It worked yeah With Caduceus Bane we got
it It almost didnt make it but with Bane it
made it
  Oh hydra
 Calebs hiding
  Dont roll a one
 Can it do that because it can only do one
action
 Its  Each target must succeed on a
wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell
for the duration
 Im not seeing that Im going to look in
the book I dont see it
 It just failed because of Bane right
 
 He is slowed still So half speed
 No reactions and it can only do an action or
a bonus action not both and only one attack
 Touches up your undercut
 Get it Fjord
 Yes Caleb leans up to throw some fire at
Oh fuck Fucking He pulls out some more
Slow
 So 
 Yeah Slow again
 I only used one rdlevel and I used it and
got it back with the Arcane Recovery
 Thats two so theres one more
 So Slow DC  with Bane
 Slow
 But I only cast it on the hydra so the roll
would have been for the hydra because the snake
guy was still Slowed So I wouldnt have cast it
on the snake guy
 Could you say that I only give a fuck about
the hydra and that I was aiming at the hydra
Because thats a hundred percent true The hydra is
the big target here
 Okay
 No I dont want to look at the dice Youre
the DM Whatever you say
 I hate to do this Can I ask one last
question You just tell me to shut the fuck up
but I really dont care about the snake guy
because he seems weak to me and the spell says I
can choose the target So if I only chose the
hydra I really dont care about that snake guy
He seems on his last legs He seems like a weiner
dog
 Its not radius You can pick whoever you
want So if there were like six guys I can say
Those two guys and not get the rest
 But if I only aimed at the hydra and didnt
aim at the snake guy that roll would have gone to
the hydra Never mind
 Its too nitpicky
 I assumed that it would carry over but
youre right It drops and you start afresh
 Good
 I Its okay Now I understand how it works
 Beaus low
 Oh and shes all by herself over there
 Youre with Jesters clone but
youre between them
 Wow
 Oh jeez okay Im not within range of it
right Because theres a tunnel here
 I killed it you saw it Im backing up as
far as I can go
 I need to see it
 Im going to cast Fire Bolt at one of its
heads
 What if I stand next to Jester instead And
risk my life
 Half cover
 Thats fine thats what Im doing
 Okay so thats regular and that is a  to
hit
 Im using Fire B yes fucking Dragonballing
that shit Does the hydra have nads
 When Im in melee with something Well I
would know that
 Lets pretend like I knew that
 So its disadvantage no matter what Right
 Disadvantage
 So I got to roll again
 The first was  The second was much worse

 Not a good day for Caleb
 Im in range now right
 Okay Im good
 Yes Im staying If I run its going to
hit me so Im just going stay put
 Nobodys allowed to learn at the table
 Hes focused on us
 I have this hydra miniature at home and when
I get home Im going to go to my office and Im
going to throw him into the neighbors yard
 Theres the oni the giant red dragon
 Just a few more decades and youll have
mastered this game
 Thats the game
 Save us Yasha
 Shes so strategic
 Fucking Swede
 One very important question Am I still
high as balls
 I had some words for Jamedi in the middle of
my drug high
 But it would have been glorious
 So like a medium range roll like a 
 Hit the hydra killed Beau
 We just need to wait this out We killed all
the creatures How many eyes do I have right now
Because it feels like I have three of them
 Thats good
 Whoa
 Oh yeah Hey you guy How come you did not
do anything
 It was pretty touchandgo Do you want to
sit back and stay safe and then get eaten I am
really not myself right now
 Three eyes each one is an onyx stone
 Are you reading anything off of all of the
eyes that I am seeing those stones
 Question
 do the eyes in this picture bear
any resemblance to the tattoos I spied through the
window when I eavesdropped through Frumpkin on
Fjord and Avantikas conversation
 Very much so okay
 Und amber for the three eyes on the head
or every single time
 You described the first group looked
humanoid no strange features just arms legs
head but for the second one with the serpent
theyre a little weird
 Also the three figures on each wall are
they standard humanoid form
 Is there any writing of any kind
 Am I able to read it with the Comprehend
Languages that should still be cooking because
its an hourlong spell
 Come on dice Be good to me No That is a

 Wait Fjord Can I talk to you for a second
before you go down there
 There is the pillars are covered when I do
the shield when I cover myself and put the
shield the columns have that in them
 Yeah but its protection Its holding
something in or holding something back We know
what that thing is with the yellow eyes but what
is the tapeworm
 They are picking the lock on this safe
 Maybe They might need three Theres two of
three Im eyeing Jamedi as I say that Presumably
just two of three As long as its just one maybe
Fjord is thinking better of it
 Im grabbing Nott by the scruff and dragging
her up the stairs
 Okay
 Werent there spiral stairways
 Can we see to the ceiling of this chamber
 Eyes up Make a perception you said
 
 Yeah its stuck up there ja
 So the fountain lowered but Nott is trapped
inside
 Wait were in the chamber Were all inside
there
 Im going to cast Dancing Lights and send
four globules up around the roof so that everyone
can see everything perfectly
 Wait I cast Enlarge on Caduceus so hes
twice his size
 Double the size ja
 Yeah Caduceus hold Fjords hand Fjord
hold his hand you got it
 I cast Reduce and now he is half his size
 Oh theyre gone then because Enlarge
Reduce
 None of that was like a melee attack or
anything
 Because your damage is reduced since youre
teeny
 Seven over here as well
 Im sorry Dante could you please describe
the Where everyone is physically the enemies
and us Just so I can see it in my head a bit
better
 Yeah
 Also the trapdoor
 Ah ja son of Sparta the trapdoor into
this place was like a metal grate wasnt it Not
fully like there were holes Was it a metal
grate or was it solid
 Yeah but not like metal with holes for the
water to go through
 No
 Its slowly starting to sink
 Its a verbal spell
 Verbal You have to speak
 Ill go first because Im scared Im going
to use my air to cast Expeditious Retreat on
myself So I too am going to spit out some air
and do this in the water That doubles my speed
which I can use a bonus action for dashing plus
my movement I will swim up five feet and then
towards the stairs
 Thats everything
 Im dead
 Oh question
 Matt did you move me two
groups of movement Because it would be for the
bonus action action and movement So itd be one
more third
 When you cast it you get that extra juice
and then bonus action on every following round
 Thank you
 I have not released it yet no
 Oh is it Tis so its dropped so hes
regular size
 So I have three ways to move First way is
the bonus action Do I reach oxygen doing that
 Does that get me to air
 So all the way to the tippytop
 Oh balls Ill use bonus action and
movement to go as high as I can Do I reach the
trap door
 I will pull out the wire from my spell
components and try to jimmy to lock Oh god I
dont know what to do Im underwater yeah So I
still have action so Im going to try to open the lock
 Straight roll
 Oh its so good Natural  and a three
Thats a four
 I lost five of those hoohas for casting a
spell you said so do I need to make a
constitution throw
 Okay lets all die together 
 If there was air where Beau was wouldnt
there be air where Caleb was
 Im hasted almost and I just blasted up to
the top of the temple
 Then I would have  Then I failed
the lock picking
 Im taking a breath of air Caleb would have
just rebounded back down and swam I use bonus
action if that gets me to them good If not I
will use bonus action plus movement to get to them
which I would assume it would get me there Then I
help Nott I will continue to drag Jester up
towards the surface
 I cast Feather Fall on myself on Nott on
Jester on Beauregard and on Fjord
 Its my last spell slot
 I already did it it doesnt matter Its
what I did Its who I know not what hit points exist
 I can see that
 They are on all sides the people down
below or are down on one side of them
 Im paddling through the air towards the
direction we came from
 Drei
 I have keen mind I would call out exactly
the right way to go
 I have keen mind I would know the way that
would lead us towards the way we came
 Ja That way Go that way
 Unnatural 
 Yeah I would be calling out this whole time
which ways we want to go to get out ja
 Raiders of the Lost Ark were just cutting
through the jungle
 Question are we under  minutes since we
shot out the top of that pimple
 So Im still sped up and Im going to run
at the front and just shout out directions and
call out holes things in the ground to look out
for Im going to lead the charge
 Okay Natural 
 I see it and use the Glove of Blasting to
fire three Scorching Rays
 Three Scorching Rays
 No the glove I havent used
 Yeah theres three rays
 How do I handle this Is this a skill
check
 No Im just waiting for Nott to throwing it
back at them yeah
 Well I reacted to Fluffernutter being
shouted and seeing it
 So I will track it and then hit it as it
struck the ground
 Well I rolled three times because theres
three rays Do I use the spell modifier for this
or not
 Okay so the highest roll was a  and then
the second highest was a  so probably of the
three rays probably only one
 I rolled a  a  and a 
 Total of 
 One
 I tell the group shes doing something
stupid Shes distracting them I have an idea but
I dont want to leave her lets go I start
trudging through the jungle towards the direction
I think is the right one
 Are we able to tell the direction where
the lizardmen are in relation to Nott or just
yuanti on us
 Im saying we all hear the yuanti or
Nott hears the yuanti coming
 Okay but I can tell the direction Nott is
running Or moving
 Youve seen us we havent seen you
 Never mind
 Yashas moving towards the beach Calebs
going to just start firing Firebolt after Firebolt
at the treeline Ive a  foot range and is
going to set the jungle on fire behind us
 Natural one
 Its all they had at Smogschmeade
 One die roll man One die roll
  I said bi
 Is that superglued on or something
 It was in a hurry but the type of runes
that were in that chamber were one of protection
some sort of ward that I dont understand Its
old It shook the entire room we were in I
thought maybe there were three locks down there
but you only saw one Presumably there are two
more places in the ocean or in the world for you
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah she said for all of us to hear that
the real reward comes from releasing the serpent
Is that your intentions Is that what you desire
 So what are we doing
 She looks at him like a skeleton key she
needs him for what she wants
 I doubt she would allow us to leave on any
terms
 She needs whats in him
 If we want to leave we are not going to
walk away were going to sneak away Shes not
going to let go of you You are a key that she
needs She said herself that greater things come
when the serpent is released The giant godlike
serpent I would ask you were all here We like
you and if you are being completely forthright
with us were good but if we get the slightest
whiff that you are after what this woman is
after Well I cant speak for them Im not
interested in being here anymore
 Also that boat is fucked and they could
shoot us to bloody hell if they wanted to so it
wont be that big of a stretch if we wanted
private sleeping quarters
 None of us have any chance any other option
but to play along
 Whats Jester doing right now
 Yeah well you do what you have to
 Yeah Im exhausted
 Shes cleaning up
 Ive seen this film
 His name is Captain Wiggledick
 Fade to tentacles
 How many points of exhaustion
 You succeed the check but you disappoint
your dungeon master
 Right in the blowhole
 Aw thats a great ending Thats a good
finish
 Pitiful
 I rolled a two so a con bonus gets me to
four points up
 Seamen seamen everywhere

 While theyre fucking
 I would try to locate Caduceus on the boat
actually I dont know if hes hiding or not
 I will go to where he is on the boat and

 You look
 Tired as I feel Do you have a moment
 May I come in
  I feel a little poorly for
the time you have been having traveling with us
It was not a very good day Its been a string of
bad ones in fact and I am grateful to have you
along with this group because we get hurt a lot
and stick our noses places maybe we shouldnt You
have been very helpful
 Is it your intention to continue on with
us
 Well sometimes acts of good faith deserve
to be rewarded when they can I wanted to give
you something that will make your time with us a
little bit easier I suppose I start to pull the
periapt out and untie it This you know Im
always so far back away from I hear you Laura
in my peripheral I hear you Im always very far
back anyway this isnt doing me much good and
its better that you stay up more than I stay up
because if you go down thats it This is a
little bit of extra protection anyway
 I dont know I would like to think not but
I dont know
 Thats a pretty big matzo ball
 If you have this this is magic by the
way
 Here you go
 I help you that makes it easier to help all
of us
 Welcome to the Nein
 Okay I feel like shit so Im going to go
to bed
 Rolling them double ones
 Periapt of wound closure It just feels
right that its with you
 Makes it harder for him to die It was
Mollys
 Wheres my owl
 You have three or four more days if you
want
 Yeah I
 iOwl
 You want to know if this is something Do
you have a moment
 Okay I will cast Identify on this
 Ja thats a feather Thats just a
feather Its good looking though
 Okay
 Are you good
 Its pretty cute
 Jesus Christ
 Dibs
 I know which direction is north at all
times I dont forget anything Im real smart
ingame
 Just in the game
 Oh jeez
 What the fuck
 Caleb runs up from under the deck with
sulfur in one hand and bat shit in the other one
What is going on What is this
 What are we doing
 Arent weoh Oh
 Youre good
 I could fix it
 Do you need that Yeah okay
 She is intimidating
 I fire off a Fire Bolt straight up into the
sky in an arc over and let it land in the ocean
 Yeah a Fire Bolt You dont want us to be
unhappy
 
 Also when you are down there you hear in
 I start lobbing Fire Bolts into the sea like
Im skipping stones every ten or  seconds
 Okay Caduceus aired the fact that he is a
little nervous so I place my hand on Caduceus
shoulder and then look through Frumpkins eyes to
see whats going on
 Oh I wasnt trying to do a perception
check Im not searching for anything Im just
checking in
 Thats exactly what I want to do
 I call out up there
 Captain your
quartermaster is under attack
 Well see
 I actually want to ask Frumpkin to do
something from on deck
 Okay
 Frumpkin is going to fly over towards this
gentleman and try to with talons rake across his
head With advantage because hes stunned yeah
Thats a  or an 
 I cast Vampiric Touch through Frumpkins
touch and he takes d necrotic damage
 Through me Me through her Him Damn it
That is eight points of necrotic damage to him
 Mmhmm
 Frumpkin lands on his head
 As soon as Caleb felt Caduceus walk away he
dropped Frumpkins sight because he didnt want to
be smacked in the face
 But Frumpkin will listen to you
 I know that it is true because I think his
thoughts and he thinks mine We are the best of
friends Hes the best cat that any man could ever
have
  Magical traps
  Almost got it
  Captain Cupcake
 I rolled a  on insight
 Its a seven
 Yeah its a seven
 No
 Oh it is a one
 No Ive been exactly where I was Do you
want to know more about my cat Because you walked
off before The funny thing about a cat is that
they are very persnickety but with the right
person they are not Frumpkin with me we are
just so
 No that would be Im a very intelligent
person That would be foolish I dont talk to
thin air Also some people say that they have
nine lives which is funny because we
 Did you find books
 Its a long shot We are on the
 You thought it too didnt you
and books and cats and books and cats
 Ja Youre telling me your love of higher
learning I understand Did you need something
Because you clearly dont want to hear about cats
so we could end this now
 That would have been so awesome
 I can talk now Okay
 I will still help you I need a moment so I
set it down and start scrawling on the floor
around it and about ten minutes later I have
 No because well I guess I wasnt there
No I mean if they put the box down in front of me
 Thats a lucky find
 You shush now give me a moment
 Ten minutes later after I
transform into an Autobot I cast Identify through
the ritual spellcasting feat

 I need time Its a long piece of paper Its a
lot of knowledge
 So you talk amongst yourselves for one
minute
 Its endless but it takes ten minutes
 Sit down
 This is your lucky day This is very
dangerous to give to you but you are the perfect
person to have it so of course well here it is
it is yours This will allow you to paint things
and they become real
 Almost anything Nothing too fancy
 This will allow her to paint a door and
there to be a door This will allow her to paint
a sword and there will be a sword
 All you can eat Fjord
 I explain it all in about a minute
 So just dont create a penis on my head
okay And were square
 Excellent
 No it cannot do that
 It cannot create fabulous jewels and it
cannot create piles of gold
 You could in theory paint a small boat on
the deck of the ship if no one was watching but
that would be a difficult thing to do
 It would create a facsimile of that but it
would be worthless
 What  This is a Formica
table green is its color
 This is good this can blast an enemy with a
bit of arcane oomph
 A little bit yeah
 You have a shield
 Did we bring him down here yet
 Go to hell
 Lets get Captain Tusktooth down here
because that was an interesting afternoon but it
was not what I want to do with the rest of my
life
 Thats the goto
 Will hurt your enemies not just protect
you
 I mean this is a matter of survival If we
do not cooperate shes going to kill us Im not
opposed per se to what went down today but its
not what I want to do with my life I would prefer
to break away from this woman but were here for
you right now You are trying to figure out you
know your thing I think Id like to hear from
you what the longterm plan is Are we on the
ship in the sea Is that what youre after
 What is the good scenario the good version
of releasing a massive serpent onto
the Menagerie Coast
 Shes made her interest pretty clear
 Of course
 I will follow
 How far away is she Were in broad
daylight
 Just dicks dropping into the ocean
 Not far
 Of course you can I scan around for
Avantika
 Okay That is a 
 You are dealing with very large
responsibilities right now I dont envy your
position You know my father was a soldier and he
expected a lot I learned a lot from him Ive
tried to live up to the man that he was and Ive
largely failed but Ive picked up what I could
Used my wits understand my surroundings I wish I
had half the courage he did I dont know You
know I think traveling with all of you has
emboldened me some I was alone for a long time
and ran from everything I like this group and I
enjoy traveling with you Fjord
 Ive always been like that I have a very
good memory I remember everything
 I feel like a fool much of the time Im
glad you think so highly of me
 I start nervously twiddling a wire in my
hand absentmindedly
 Keep the group safe
 As always I will do my best
 I cough very hard into my hands and cast
that woman is going to try to kill you I really
do
 
 Yeah do you have some
 I receive it Theres not much left Most of
it spilled
 Is this a custom
 Its good
 Private conversation
 The wettest dream
 Youve successfully secured deez nuts
 When life gives you pepper make pepper
arrows
 
 
  Ukotoa
 Yes
 Muscle is obviously everywhere
 Were going to be following the people who
have been here before
 Following up on Fjords question or Travis
question the muscle that we see around us does
it look like its are we in Deadwood or is
there a strong police force of sorts that is
making sure that shit is not going down
constantly
 Yeah is there anyone in charge or is it
just a saloon with cowboys everywhere
 Probably the only rule here is Talk shit
get hit
 Oh my name is Philip
 Oh is this required Refugee from the
Empire looking for better life
 Guys were the heroes here
 Garbage wine
 Pirate on pirate violence is verboten
 Thats true
 You are going to judge me for finger
motions Hold on everybody stop the game Laura
Bailey just shamed me for a sexual finger motion
at this table after three and a half
motherfucking years I have seen everything
Resume the game
 How did you fall into it
 Where do you hail from
 What do you snipe with
 Youre an interesting fellow
 My name is Phillip
 What is that I dont have my contacts in I
can barely see it Thats  right So that is 
 Oh I am a navigator Newer but eager and
looking forward to plying my trade
 Its right that way
 Its still over toward the hallway over
there
 You know this is our first time on these
islands and I dont know much about it at all Is
there any legal system here Do you know what I
mean Or is it just you know 
 I am a big reader and there is a lot I dont
know like my tall friend over here I mean there
must be trouble that breaks out There must be bar
fights
 Well I can see the appeal but what happens
if theres something risky or it causes theft of
property for someone important
 So Plank King is the law
 Thats biblical
 We are trying to get the lay of the land
here
 Might have gotten to that perhaps
 You have mashed his hair spikes down
 Caleb brings a big mug of ale and sits down
a big longshot but you seem very welltraveled
and wellresearched This place is crazy but any
place worth its salt has books Why are you
laughing at me Why are you laughing at me Such a
straightforward question Well I can tell from
your reaction that there is probably no good place
to acquire a book but you seem more educated than
the normal sort or people around me so perhaps
you have a suggestion for a scholar lost at sea
 Sundry Square during the day
 Should I be checking the trash bins for
these then Or do you think someone might
actually have them for sale
 Im jonesing pretty badly for a good book
 Like a persons worth
 Oh jeez take my chair fine Ill go get
another
 Former business associate
 
 Yeah Im more concerned about the waves
You have experience with this Diving
 Yes or no question
 Pretty sure its anywhere
 Ooh Cold
 Here comes the fanart I hope
  All right Im done Hand me that
dead cat
 Youre not going to drink that are you
 Yeah Well its a lumpy place
 You doing okay You seem a little off to
me
 Yeah you seem distracted around this
woman
 Oh is it because shes a murderer
 Oh I dont like that part about her
 I dont think that all of us are murderers
 Are you a murderer
 Yeah but thats a very specific thing You
know if your life is in danger thats one thing
You know if something happens in the heat of the
moment or theres danger in both directions
Murder is premeditated Thats a very different
thing I find it hard to believe that you have
killed someone with premeditation I could be
wrong but
 That I believe
 Yes I have
 Yeah Sort of
 Oh Well Nott and I have robbed people for
sure People with not a lot of money so that we can eat
 That did that we did to you when we first
met you You know we turn one thing into another
and then we go stay at an inn and buy food and
then it turns back into pennies and thats not so
good but when youre starving
 They didnt know it though
 Yeah
 No Do you want any ale
 Boy this is quite a predicament that weve
gotten ourselves into How the hell we were
visiting your mother Your mother was so lovely
 Thats not true
 Well get you home Were here this is
Fjords thing Were his support Were here to
help him out Beauregard and I dont want to be
here forever either I dont think I know that I
do not want to be in this place or on the sea
forever Its interesting
 Nott is like a cat clinging to the ceiling
Shes like a cat on a hot tin roof
 Really none of us like it here but Fjord
kind of
 Theres parts of it that he likes
 I dont know Youre sweet on him yeah
 Yeah
 How do you mean
 I think so
 Thats a little out of my realm of
experience Im sorry
 I dont forget anything
 She was handsome
 No I said she
 She was handsome
 Yeah
 The best
 For me
 That was a long time ago anyway Lets just
focus on getting out of this place away from that woman
 Is there anyone paying attention to us
 Or like just leaning in a table together
very low Elf 
 Well I dont care Im pulling out the wire
and Im putting it in my mouth Well take care of
her if we have to 
 Yeah just a cough A cold I want to get
the hell off this island eventually but were
here now Tomorrow
 Yes Well find no Probably not But
well get sorted Well make the best of this
place Well help Fjord figure out his shit I
suppose
 Yeah Then well get out of here and then
you can reassess back on dry land
 Thanks for not leaving me on the street like
a drunk
 I think well probably going to get a room
somewhere here Is this place an inn or a tavern
I did not even look coming in
 Did Avantika leave or did she go up
 Probably to shit in an alleyway
 Just drinking until
 If ever youre going to squat on that chair
in a perch this is it

 A few hundred years Is there some sort of
weather pattern or natural phenomenon that is
responsible for this
 But there arent creepy stories about every
inch of it is there
 Fair point
 What are we looking for Are we just taking
it in
 Learn the city
 Ja and how welllit is it out here
 Maybe they thought they were tough and
strong and they were not as tough and strong as
they thought so now they sell rope
 
 How far away can you do a popin
 We could also potentially send Frumpkin with
a note or letter
 Leave it
 Also this leads me to a question I have
which is instead of discussing the short term
which we want to do I want to ask you about the
long term If we ditch Tiffany and we find the
apricot tree what happens then Like what is
your plan with this apricot I think we have ideas
about what could come from it Shes done what she
did at the first tree and you got the next tree
and maybe she races to the What happens next
Fjord Like I know you are curious but what is
the plan
 Well call him Honda
 Do you know how at the first tree an
apricot was picked and things shook something
happened there This place was all about drei
the number three so you want to go pluck another
fruit and thats two out of three and what happens
once the third
 I am not telling any of you especially you
what to do here but an alternative plan is to get
rid of anyone who knows about the location of the
tree and bury the tree
 What if some of us kept Avantika busy
 This is difficult
 What if Fjord keeps Tiff busy
 Man oh man
 What if the green guy and the gal are busy
you follow
 Let me finish the thought You do that
thing you take your little doorway over you do
what you want to do then poof you are Tiffany
You walk off the boat because Tiffany is busy
  busy not maybe busy maybe shes
sleeping maybe shes out for a walk
 Its real quiet at this table

 Youre small
 Thats also true
 Hes right here
 Well Frumpkin has had a peek inside of her
quarters after she has seen him She did not see
him the first time Although to be doubly sure I
could change his shape again
 But you know if were not comfortable I
could change Frumpkin to be say a raven or something
 Thats where its going to go down is in the
Bloated Cup
 I thought maybe it would say like maybe you
know romantic on the boat But great Good So
if thats the case then Im not getting into that
room I think that I should tail this team
instead if youve got an eye on the exit to that
building
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think what Beaus implying is perhaps its
better that were never seen there at all
 Here is how I would like to contribute
First Im going to disguise myself when it is
time Not yet but I will make myself look like
voice actor Charlie Adler I will be
saltandpepper Ill fit right in on the docks
 I wont be in a denim tuxedo but I will
wear traditional pirate garb
 They are bullshit There will be no sleeves
on this disguise Im going to hang out between
the Bloated Cup and the ship looking like
Charlie Frumpkin I will just have circle a
continuous circle above the whole area so I can
see the guards on the boat and we can message
each other ja Ill just be eyes in the sky
Charlie on the ground
  Thunderstruck
 Do me a favor Im going to go outside now
okay and keep watch Let me know when youre on
and give me updates Good luck Charlie Adler
 Charlie For every spell
 Im out in the docks You said the boat
 Oh okay
 Also while they do that Im sorry
 I was going to say once Im out and about
about once every  seconds I will lean on
something pretending like Im slightly drunk and
I will go into Frumpkins vision from above just
for five seconds to look at the activity on the
boat and where those guards are and then go out of it
 Okay Ooh terrible So terrible Thats six
or seven
 Its all that fog
 Just like Macbeth
 Caleb probably has wandered close enough to
the boat now and hearing
 Weve established the
 Apologies to my German teacher from high
Laurentia liebe Laurentia mein
  Am Sonntag 
Urination  Ach wenn es doch endlich schon
 Okay Well Im definitely pissing and
singing
 Yep I have rolled such shit tonight
 Thats a five  Von Dienstag
 Oh okay Well Ill do my best to knock
things over as I go
  Hey Macarena
  We will we will rock you Rock
you
  BANANAS
  Hast du etwas Zeit fur mich
 Youre stealthing
 None of us knew about the crows nest
person
 
 Its pandemonium on the docks right At
this point
 Yeah I would have quieted down with the
singing and just tried to go more lowkey I dont
know whats going on so Im still watching the
boat
 And one eye on the Loaded Underwear Whats
it called The Bloated
 Bloated Cup Fjords Bloated Cup What did
you say Perception
 Still rolling shit tonight 
 Boat Bloated Cup Back and forth Waiting
 Quit while youre ahead motherfucker
 Not a giant hole
 Charlie Adler busts into the inn and sees
Caduceus and just stops the door and pulls out a
is We have to go to the boat now Come on
 Caduceus
 No one told Caleb shit
 No I saw people running to the boat in
danger and you lead off Pandemonium on the ship
and fire on the ship
 They dropped their shit
 
 It went very well I take it
 The slow creep on your face Matt Come on
high
 Charlie Adler concurs

 No its Caleb
 That what Detects a problem
 Wherever they are Celestial Common
Sylvan With my experience tinkering with
Comprehend Languages would I believe this is
something I could
 Yeah All right I begin casting the ritual
spell
 Itll take me  minutes to be able to read
this if I can
 Caleb is not listening to anyone He is
sprinkling pinches of salt and soot in a circle
around the book
 
 Well its up to you
  All the soot and salt ignites and
then suddenly whoa Whats it say
 So Caleb would seeing this play out as he
reads would explain it all very carefully and
delicately because he knows how conflicted a
subject how charged a subject it would be for
Fjord But does tell everyone in the room
everything
 Shes cooked
 Minor detail
 in Calebs deciphering of all
the fragments was there any sense that there was
any kind of romantic relationship between Avantika
and Vandren Or its unclear
 Okay
 Yeah her own cipher
 Thats not helpful at all
 Which necklace would that be
 First time Im seeing it not really but
just give me ten minutes
 Heres the question Could brainiac Caleb
with this book which is her own coded cipher
Comprehend Languages with enough time try to study
the recurrence of vowel sounds consonance sounds
and try to create a key to this book
 Yeah
 But people break codes
 Ive rolled shit all night Every roll
 Natural 

 Oh pretty good Straight intelligence
right
 
 Yeah it bumped up to  when I leveled up
 Saving throw sorry I was looking at the
wrong place Thats correct 
 Thats fine I would like to Because I was
asking you a question and then suddenly it was
happening right
 Lets say Caduceus gives Caleb the necklace
Hell take ten minutes to figure out what this
jade necklace is and spend the night decoding this
book
 Its not a book
 Its a necklace
 Just says found someone special
 This is like that around your neck except
its specific to warding off poison No poison
 It could help any one of us really Would
you like it Nott
 I say we tie it to a rock and drop the rock
off a specific dock and maybe were lucky and
its still there later
 We have to be able to have someone point the
finger at her though because what happens if she
finds it herself later
 But if she finds it she could throw it out
She could sell it She could say I found this in
my room I mean thats unpredictable I mean we
cant control that
 This is the key Anything else is a
distraction can only cause wrinkles so we ditch
it Maybe somewhere where it can be found again
but it is not as important as this book is So we
solve this and her goose is cooked
 We do though
 I have a question for the group because I
dont remember Did Beauregard share with the
group that she got tapped by the Plank King
 Maybe we send Frumpkin with this stuff in
tow to his little perch with a note An anonymous note
 I have a copy In my noodle
 Ja I can write it down
 Well it could be an anonymous note Or we
could send Frumpkin once we leave here and you
could sign it from Beauregard
 Spill it girl Spill it
 To go with this once I have deciphered it
for them
 Avantikas coming for your throat This is
the evidence do with it what you will We go to
the pomegranate tree
 We could also add to this note that Frumpkin
delivers that Avantika Here is your proof that
Avantika wants your throat the whole crew is
complicit
 No heres the thing If we just give them a
page
 I am going to make a cipher that can be used
to decode this book If we send a cipher and the
book they can take time to read the entire
thing
 Hmm
 Ja thats good
 But well leave immediately
 Correct
 Ja Goodnight
 I take out the silver thread first
 I only used one
 I wasnt working on the book and the cipher
all at once all through the night
 Thats what Im saying yeah
 Ja Yeah yeah yeah Sorry
 Right this very minute hes a oneounce
owl
 Ten minutes
 Stall for me
 Dumb as a brick
 Its in Calebs possession isnt it
 I take a bit of phosphorus and squelch it
through my hand and cast Wall of Fire across the
entire length of the boat between them and us
 Im sweating
 Like the salt on the rim of a margarita
phosphorus through my hand
 We should have worked out Frumpkin in
advance
 I thought wed have time in the morning
 The last ten minutes have been like Dont
cast it Just wait Just wait Just wait Okay
  feet tall I can choose which side the
wall burns feet reach and which side does not
 This table cant bear my weight
 I dont know how I would make it go on an
angle without causing problems
 Best I can
 Well this isnt what I imagined in my head
but we are standing where we are standing so Im
going with what I see
 Okay I want that to go like that but its
not going
 I would like the last one to be on this
gentleman
 Leaving room to get to this gangway but
hes burning and thats going like this
 Facing this to there also allowing access
to both the gangplanks

 I cant make them stick man
 Fucking real DD people It went better in
rehearsal
 We all know Im not going to touch it
the gangplanks are open
 Thats right Hes just out of your line of
sight
 Its a tenfoot reach on the outside of this
thing
 On the outside I choose the side so
clearly Im not going to burn us
 Shit Bad rolls  total
 A one a two and a three were the first
three rolls
 Also to toss out
 the flames are opaque so
they cannot be seen through
 Eight
 Okay Its wedged into my belt Yeah okay
 Counterspell
 I know and its at disadvantage 
 I rolled a  and a  She fails
 Can I hear her go 
 Oh natural  and a  plus perception
The lowest roll was a 
 I never do
 Are you asking Oh youre asking me
 If they end their turn or the first time it
hits them
 When it enters the wall for the first time
on a turn or ends its turn there
 Moves or clears the
  that time
 
 Thats going to hit
 Absolutely
 Its a ten right because its half
 At disadvantage
 Oh saving throw Well I rolled twice
 Straight because they were both pretty
good Natural 

 Hits yeah
 Thats balls That is just a seven
 Does the cloud remain in the sky
 Okay so it was a one time
 Oh yeah okay
 Are there any crates or anything around on
the dock that look liftable from Catapult
 Okay if they look light enough I will
throw one up into the air at Avantikas head
 No I am going instead to cast Expeditious
Retreat on myself and at the same time change the
focus on my transmuter stone to a constitution
buff Thats it Im going to jet back  feet
 It hits
 My AC is 
 Oh I have nine hit points
 Yeah Im out
 Vannas going on a prank binge
 Get weird Taliesin get weird
 This encounters getting to me My body is
radiating heat Im hot everywhere Flames On the
side of my face
 That was a sick description
 That was like Babe Ruth summoning a demon
from hell
  feet from Caleb at this point I was 
feet from Fjord
 Dex bonus
  Your punishment will be
more severe
 This is fucking chaos
 Anything that keeps her occupied for one
round but still
 Shes dead Oh no she passed out
 That is these dice Thats a 
 Yeah
  Whats all this then
 Nothing but sparkle pony fur
 FYI if Id stayed conscious I wouldve
thrown a Fireball at that boat
 That was my next move
 Sam Riegel shut the fuck up
 With great power
 Im angry at the villain thats what Im
supposed to be
 Youre doing great everything is fantastic
Im having a wonderful time
 My ears are going to combust
 Its so in character
 So an unnatural one
 Six rounds
 Thats fine Six rounds of carnage
 
 Yeah good call
  or  feet
  feet
  Hey I think I skinned my face
Ah Done I dont know whats going on
 Fist to the skull
 Im just
 What is my distance from the boat
  feet If I got to my feet thats half
my movement
 If I moved ten feet Id be within  feet
correct Yeah
 So I will weakly stand and I will weakly
trudge ten feet forward and I will throw a
Fireball and center it wheres Vera
 Well wheres Avantika I dont know
 Im putting it there at the mast
 I dont know whats going on Im doing the
last thing that was on my mind
 d
 She will
 
 Yes good rolls
 So Calebs whole face and cheek one side is
skinned
 Oh on mine That would be on mine sorry
everybody Scheisse I think its 
 Yeah 
 They saw the Fireball go over their heads
yes
 Multiple
 Yeah Im sure its going to fail This is a
wisdom 
 Thats a good deal Yes yes yes
 Its their new limited edition
 A thousand years of DD
 Matt we have played this game for hundreds
of hours together That was two of the best hours
of this game ever That was so much fun
 No It was so good
  You crazy motherfucker
 Yeah
 Well Ive noticed that theyre not letting
any of us cast anything correct
 Then no I would do Mage Armor but no
 Motherfucker
 Then in these circumstances I would dismiss
Frumpkin from the Material Plane and bring him
back on my shoulder so hes with me
 Hes friendly Thats my pet cat
 Im thinking really bad thoughts
 Yeah its wedged into the back page
 Excuse me I am the one who deciphered this
That is near the end
 As you will if that is welcome here but
yeah The bit about her being a traitor to the
Plank King and wanting to rule over the entire
sea and have the Plank King I believe the words
are if I remember correctly because my memory is
spotty bend the knee
 Is near the end ja right here
 Its complex
 I would like to read her as well
 At disadvantage
  for me
 Caleb sees it Go away Fjord Go away
 Holy shit
 Mein Gott
  Silence speaks volumes
though
 I worked through the night on that Its
very interesting
 Breakfast
 He is so stoned
 You counterbalanced the rest of this game
 Has that happened since the walk of shame
 Two years ago
 Ja we will take the bigger boat
 No
 No
 We have our crew We do not need them
 Ill be doing that at disadvantage
  percent of the damage
 Yes but the upside was so
 Yeah  feet tall For six to  seconds
That didnt last more than two rounds
 Absolutely
   Paint on the mast
 I have a question If I finally go to bed
for like  hours Minor Alchemy for a
transmutation wizard I am able to perform an
alchemical procedure on one object composed
entirely of wood stone iron copper silver and
transform it into another material If there was
damage to the mast would I be able to shove other
things in there and turn it to wood That seems
like too much
 Its a spell that I couldve done but I
didnt take that spell I chose Counterspell
 I sell falchions and
 Yeah we survived and
 Theyre magnifying Matt Whered you get
those
 So were going right into her vagina
 There aint no fucking port around here
motherfucker
 Max Headroom coming at you from the
mids Wwwhat
 Yeah Matt is just barely old enough to know
what that is
 I said you know what it is Just barely
 He was in The Stand as the Trashcan Man
 Are you doing that
 If were talking about like business shit
know that this has been less than ten days but I
need my cat so I am taking my owl I apologize
On a side note so impressed I walk off with my
little tiny oneounce owl
 I will take the time to turn Frumpkin I
have two uses left with incense back into a
Bengal cat So he can live his best life as a
Bengal cat
 Diplomatic catmunity
 Oh right I rolled an  and a  ten
minutes ago
 I rolled an investigation check ten minutes
ago at disadvantage and the lower is a  My
investigation is plus eight Im smart
 Yes I rolled an  and a 
 Are there any more gigantic hats
 Gigantic hats
 Are you in this room with us too right
now
 Yeah Im sitting on the bed right now
 Wait a second look at me Im sitting on
the bed I am the servant of a demigod This is
going to be very hard for Fjord
 We can get back to what youre talking
about but think about it for a moment its just
the three of us right We have our heads in the
same game We are the three assholes in this
group yeah
 That is correct
 Im joking because this has been such a hard
day but Fjord is going to find this very difficult
 That is minimalizing what he is dealing with
right now He is trying to find a father he has
compromised himself with this woman for us for
himself for all of our safety It is going to be
difficult for him
 You have your pluses and your minuses
 Its mostly true
 She is too educated She is too intheknow
to talk the way she does to be interested in just
drinking and chasing our barbarian friend She is
very educated I dont know which parts are true
 Of course That is easy
 Sure what are friends for
 No I am looking forward to getting back to
the mainland and I dont mean the Menagerie
Coast Although We need to get Jester back to
her mother if we can but I am not looking forward
to being here anymore I want to get back to the
Empire
 Well there is still Vandren I have read
every inch of her notes I have communicated them to you
 I would imagine the Plank King would not
know what to make of it It clearly damns her It
does not give him enough information He wouldnt
know what to do with it
 Yeah hes not a big thinker He is
formidable but not a big thinker I think we will
have an easier time getting to this boat
 Put a piece of paper back together
 Oh fuck
 Ive been waiting to drop it Fucking water
genasi heritage man
 Youre so stupid Rose
 Do you mean your penis
 All the pertinent information is also in
here
 Full disclosure I could help you cope
with
 Nott the Brave We have things to accomplish
here If you allow me I could do what I have done
in the past a little sneakily to help you cope
with this fear you have If you allow me
 Is it Mike Myers
 Were not there yet though were talking
in advance at this point All in advance
 Fuhjordy
 Are we close What are you telling us
 I just got my cat back but if you want an
octopus to look on the bottom you have it
 Yeah I have just enough incense to yeah
sure lets make an octopus Catshaped An
octopusshaped cat
 Well I can tell him to go look and hell
come back to me I can see through him for
 Its a thousand feet To watch but he can
go and come back and I trust him Hes Frumpkin
I pull out my book and I set it on the deck and I
start working on turning my cat into an octopus
 An hour later an octopus pops out if we
wait that long
 Yeah  Well we had one or two days
together Just throw him off
 So Ill watch for the first thousand feet
but I assume he goes beyond that because its the
ocean so he keeps going down and down and down I
will tell him to look for this wreck for what we
are looking for and when he finds it to come back
and tell me about it
 
 
 If hes within  we have a connection
 A hundred Thank you
 Maybe its 
 Right weve established that I can see
indefinitely Thats what we established early in
the campaign with the circus but I cant
communicate with him
 I dont hear any of you
 Ooh he has found the ship This is a
reminder I cant hear any of you I dont want to
disconnect Dont give me wet willies
 Whos a good boy You are the best cat that
was ever put on this planet
 Oh yeah
 Oh come here you You are the most
important member of this team and dont let
Beauregard tell you different Or Nott
 Yeah that is so silly isnt it Silly yes
it is
 He found the boat Nott he found the boat He will
lead us to the boat He found it He did it
 Its the bottom of the ocean
 Its thousands of feet
 Thousands of feet
 You have a method to bring us down there
 Describe it to me Ive read a bit Explain
it to the goblin
 That is a whole day
 Now you people have not read about you
dont understand magic Its not like that I want
to try this
 Its too late Fjords in the water
swimming around
 In minimal amounts or full dose
 There was no battle There was no battle
with Avantika man
 Were sitting in your moms sitting room
right now
 I am casting Mage Armor during whatever the
fuck this is
 Its the abyss
 Yeah that makes sense Nott and I are
sharing one
 So Frumpkin is pinwheeling in front of all
of us leading the way
 No ships dont go to anchor in the middle
of the ocean They just float
 
 Thats important because I switched the
Transmuters Stone away from darkvision so I
cannot see in low light so its got to be guiding
lights for me
 He went from level two to three Doing
good
 Theyre iron right I would say that with
Nott piggybacking Caleb would take his dagger and
transmute it into iron to meld with the cannonball
and grip it that way
 Thanks
 Palming it
 We can
 There are four globules of light slowly
circling around
 Cannot do that joke anymore That joke has
past
 Cant see anymore
 I cant see shit
 Youre good Im blind and are you blind
 Nine
 One of the best ever So many great games
 This campaign is a social experiment
 All the dead
 It worked
 Yeah it worked
  Is it Thursday yet

 Im so upset  Take it away
Matt
 Does that mean that Logic was the whale that
just passed us by
 I am going to summon Frumpkin to my shoulder
and look through Frumpkins eyes because Frumpkin
as an octopus has darkvision So I will see that
way
 Oh not so good Thats his Just a seven
 I could send Frumpkin in ahead of us to have
a look around if you think thats wise
 Yes it is
 Ja thats no problem I give a little tug
to the leather tied at my knee and cast Mage
Armor I send Frumpkin in and reach for Nott and
hold Nott by the shoulder Look through Frumpkins
eyes and send him in to look
 Terrible Just terrible Five
 Fjord do you think it is safe to send in
some light with him
 Tap me on the shoulder if you hear me
because I cannot hear you
  Node
 My spell books are in there so please I
cant hear anything
 I am bowling ball sending one globule of
light in after Frumpkin to go with him
 Its mucky and dark in there We would have
to take a closer look I cannot make out much
 Were Ed Harris now
 Shes giving you your pills
 Is one the same as another
 She already has them
 In the ocean Lets take
 Yeah I schloof Frumpkin to the back of
Caduceus head
 While theyre debating I spit out four
globules of light and start casing the room
  on investigation
 The books are basically mud at this point
correct
 It could also be someone who was having
dreams Fjord
 If we are in a group they are They were
around the group
 Take your pills Travis Take your pills
 How about a high roll Nope
  Caleb takes the rear
 Sechs
 Cocked
 Theres too much awesome in one spot
 I shite take it
 Theres nothing to do about it
 Im good at those
 Thats a six
 How much did I get harpooned for  Was it

 It lightninged us
 Shield
 Ive abandoned my son
 So those two are incapacitated in this
second right
 The one on top is not
 Okay Well then I will cast Slow on the
shallow priest and the one thats laughing in front
of me as well as I back away
 Slowness
 Hurts their AC Its a wisdom saving of 
 So shallow priests AC is down by two
disadvantage on dex saves and he can only do an
action or a bonus not both
 I back away half my speed towards where
everybody is in the boat I move behind my goblin Freund
  Okay Pretty good
 Negative two to his AC
 Does it get a multiattack or does it just
get one attack
 Its a single attack
 Its speed is halved
 Make a save
 Let him Let her
 From where Im standing I see Nott firing
drunkenly up at an angle Im going to move
forward and peek up in the direction that she is
das I will cast Magic Missile at level three
 No its fick das
 A total of 
 The five of the Magic Missiles will spiral
around Fish Dicks head and come in at a different
angle and five of them go 
 I will step back in five feet
 All right lets treat this situation with
the seriousness it demands I douse the lights and
bring Frumpkin down onto my own head like a mask
so I can see through Frumpkin vision
 Like a Zorro mask with Frumpkins beak right
there
 Little Zemnian man whos like
 Cant believe
I didnt think of this sooner
 No ein bisschen
 I would
 Maybe bioluminescent just like an
underwater creature
 Ill be with Nott
 Caleb and Nott are together
 It is like the beginning of the campaign
 Yeah
 Okay so I can do that I will send Frumpkin
low along the bottom in the direction of this
thing stealthily
 Ooh lets take a lookyloo for the moment
 But I did see where this flashing source
was
 Occasional okay So its not like there was
a creature that Frumpkin and I were able to aim
towards it was just this thing that was appearing
and disappearing
 Yeah
 So were connecting those two groups
 Were spread out a little
 Frumpkin will piss out some ink and use a
bonus action to dash back towards the group
 I tell him to come back and come out and
the ridge
 Flashing moving things things that are
alive
 More than one I think
 I think so
 Or something large with many parts but I
could not tell too well
 I could not tell you
 No its murky down here
 I am reaffixing Frumpkin to my face
 But maybe
 Just you two right Is this the group
 Okay
 So the ground is littered with coins outside
of this
 It will also put it at alert even before we
get there You send it in and it sees this other
Jester and then it is ready for a fight
 Well
 Were on this ridge
 What do we see to the sides and so theres
a cavern straight ahead facing towards us
 That is my point I think we quietly go
around and get on top of the house and throw
whatever the bait is in front and then were back
here for whatever comes out
 Take our time
 Sitting on top of it
 You just turned  years old
 Yes DM
 Shitty rolls at this table
 Im going to keep an eye on our rear
 Thats all the show is now Thats the rest
of the campaign
 The hell is wrong with us tonight
 What on earth are we doing
 Mine is functional
 I am not What are we doing
 Lets go to the right then
 Yes please
 Or do
 Wait its drawing towards us or its
pulling in
 Oh jeez it jumped up Well thats a six
Seven
 Mmhmm
 Im poisoned
 Im feeling a little weary Does anyone want
to help me out a little bit
 Yeah teamwork
 What happened just now
 Okay
 No
 I didnt know that was for me
 Cant do the math right now
 Then Im good
 I thought that was for one person
 I can light it up in here if we want Or do
we want to
 Ja
 All right Im going to put the string of
globules up the passage
 At least so far they are not harassing us
 Expeditious Retreat As a reaction
 Yep
 Whatever Ive got ten minutes of zip baby
Lets go forward
 Ill say that theyre  feet ahead of us
and  feet behind
 Has it been over ten minutes
 Yeah it lasts ten minutes
 Im already in there
 
 Are these arcane glyphs or is this
language
 
 Did I pick up on the fact that Caduceus was
looking at glyphs in the wall Did I see those as well
 No Okay
 What you told me was that studying this
thing it seems to require elements to set it in
motion How did you describe it
 It is The Ring
 Theres the throne over there
 So is Nott the Brave
 Four
 Im assuming the ten minutes for Expeditious
is gone from studying the table
 A minute or two left Okay Great Ill take
it
 Son of a bitch
 Frightened
 Fuck you Come at me you sea hag
 Another one Oh good
 Really could have used that periapt right
about now
 Oh the lights are out
 On top of seven or six total
 Seven total So I got that
 But Expeditious Retreat is gone
 Is Mage Armor gone
 If I crouch behind the table from where
Dashilla is will I get half cover or something
 Okay So I am going to do that and then I am
going to
 I would like to stay semicrouched to try
and get some cover from that thing
 Thank you And I pull a twisted blackened
twig out and point it at her and cast Witch Bolt
at fourth level
 Thats a ranged spell attack correct
 Plus the Bless
 Spell attack is  plus the Bless is a d
 Its a d So 
 Blast it Gone
 Thems the breaks Thems the breaks
 The murk Its just physical crap filling
the water
 Desperation
 He just threw the basketball over his
shoulder from half court
 Its not necessarily a magical effect
 If its magic
 Thats why I asked if it was shit in the
water
 Where are they
 Im going to cast Detect Magic because I
have a suspicion that she has something on her or
perhaps the orb in her head Then I will down the
potion thats in my pocket as a bonus action
 Yeah
 Ah
 Okay so I get six points back from that I
am going to move towards Fjord and crouch behind
the table
 A little closer this way so Id be between
Fjord and the table Ja gut
 Yes Trying to get cover again
 So it doesnt affect just movement Its
everything
 Oh yeah 
 Ah You were Fjord in that moment

 Ill bring back cookies
 Sorry
 
 Yeah this is a fucked situation I am going
to hold Magic Missile at second level if she appears
 Just in case
 Thats pitiful
 Oh get her
 Shuriken
 Youre right there She probably busted
everything to get there
 
 Ooh
 Fuck you ghost
 So my held Magic Missile fizzles because
time passes right
 I have a question to you when youve done
that
 Back in the chamber Detect Magic is still
up Does Caleb see anything with an arcane glow in
this room other than what Fjord picked up
 So none of the shit around the edges okay
I guess I will start studying the runes on the
walls to see how they contribute to this mystery
 This gets the d
 
 On a whim Im going to use a ndlevel
spell slot to cast Comprehend Language instantly
to see if anything becomes clearer and I have to
touch the table and touch the walls to do that
 What are we doing here Fjord
 We should go shes not going to follow us
to the surface
 What are your goals Your goal is what
to
 You know what Avantika talked about you
know what she wanted You think this has nothing
to do with that
 Yeah but if that was some sort of lock you
want to put the key in that lock
 Do you feel any different
 Wrapping up in here
 Im going to go fuck a ghost
 Too slow shit stain
 Ghost puncher
 Youre hitting his pressure points
 Yeah I have some ideas and I am curious
but I want to know what you intend These come in
threes yeah
 No
 Yeah
 Im always curious Can I count on you to
return the favor
  
 Has anything changed with the ones on the
walls
 Okay Ive rolled ass all night and a
natural 
 About nine more
 Thank you
 Im following your lead here This is your
quest I have things that I need to do that are
not here and I am going to need help
 Okay
 I follow Fjord out
 Looking out for this hag as we go yeah
 Oh Still terrible Ten
 I would assume that next game were going
to start with a fresh day so I want to toss in
that Caleb goes to whatever chamber theyre in and
he pulls out the other book from his holsters and
he writes for hours
 I came out of that with a favor
 If you fail its half damage not full
damage
 Hello I hear youre trying to do a rogue
action
 Do you need to have any company below
 Caleb starts speaking in Zemnian
 What are
we doing What are you talking about This seems
rude to me What is going on
 Zemnian
 He was vague about his wording at that
moment
 Thats pretty freaky too
into it and my eyes are reflected back off the
thing I stare and I let it wash over me
 Which one of these two is taller
 Who what how why are you on the boat
know Seeing the world
 That clarifies that okay
 I am halfway through Identify on this
clockwork gizmo
 I was doing a ritual casting of Identify as
soon as the thing was in my hands and not talking
to anybody
 What is this thing that you have What is
this called Does it have a name
it my fun ball of tricks
 Yeah did you make it Did you get it from
someone else
like this is cool
 In a museum or
pedestal and people were looking at it and it
had a little card on it Then I saw this guy and
I was like hes a mean man and I said
 Whats his name
 Yeah
 Sir Cadigan Thats a good name
 Well Twiggy tell me This happy fun ball
of yours what does it do
 How much money
 Thats a Frumpkin and a half
frumpkins Im just kidding I dont know what
that is
 Sometimes a spider and other things as well
This does other things besides making money What
else does this do
of little flashes and things go off
 Okay
 
 That would explain the money yeah
 Can I tell how old this thing looks
 Cheeto dust sprinkles out
 No I dont hear anything
 Is it limitless Does it make money all day
long
way itll make money drop
 Can you show me the one way
 Excuse me one moment Twiggy
 Would you show me how you make money with
it
cross my knees I put it in my lap and its like
this giant beach ball I do this same movement
where I pull it from the top around so that it
opens up and then I can use my thumb You see my
fingers are actually long and slender and
perfectly suited for this It pushes around the
other side doing the same movement I did before
 May I see that one more time
Catch
 From perfect memory I duplicate what she
just did
 Well I take them
 Yeah I walk it over to him Here you go
 No I dont think thats a good idea
 What are we going to do with this little kid
andor old lady
 Oh no dont you dare
 Its an 
 Yeah Im not a happy guy
 
 Do you have any prospects Any longterm
plans goals Where do you see yourself in a year
let alone a week from now
 What about Kiri
 What about Nott
 Thats going to draw attention to us
 Is this regular paint or the magic paint
 Thats good
 
 Noted
 I am also worried about traveling around
Well I am not a fan of the name Balleater for
this boat
 On a similar note I feel like our new
miniature friend will also draw attention
 Maybe Ill have a chat with her get us on
the same page
 Sometimes people listen to me
 Well it takes two to tango My palms are
sweating at the moment
 I am going to find our little friend
 How long has she been doing that for
 Bitte a moment of your time just to have
a chat You can keep swinging but could you swing
a little lower
almost like I couldnt fall at all You see me
grabbing on the hooks like a little monkey I fly
down the mast and jump down so I can sit right
next to you
 All of that movement is making me nervous
 Welcome to The Mighty Nein
 Its sort of a running gag but its our
name
 You know if youre going to be traveling
with us for a while I have a few suggestions
 So three The first of them is probably when
we get to land it will be better if you kept a
low profile because we sometimes cut a rough
swathe wherever we go and I cant guarantee that
someone is not familiar with us So I would hate for any danger to you know best not to call attention
friends
 Well just stick with us for a little while
and see how that works out
 Okay The second suggestion is that you
should meet my cat Frumpkin
 Whats the matter
 Oh my cat is very well trained and will not
hurt your squirrel I promise
good  Sorry Its me saying it
Its not Trixie its me saying it 
Im crate trained
 I scarcely know what to do with you Well
get to the cat in a minute I will so gladly
introduce you to my cat because Im very fond of
him and love for people to meet him But before we
do that the third suggestion is and I cast
Suggestion I suggest you share any strange or
unique or arcane objects or things even that are
of threat with me just so I know that we are safe
 Thats rough
 
 Oh how about you just sit next to me
bag again theres feathers and fleece and all
this sand and stuff Im pulling out I pull out a
 Oh put that back in your pocket
You want to see something cool
 Always
my head As I do that another little Twiggy shows
up right next to me and when I move she moves I
 I put one of my hands through their heads
 Oh thats good
getting me
 Yeah Im not going to try to do that
 Is there anything
 Yeah the neatest Do you have anything that
is harmful or is it just those two things
including your puzzle ball
 Yeah okay well
 For what its worth I apologize and heres
my cat I turn Frumpkin the first night on this
boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies
so its Frumpkin the cat right now Thats Frumpkin
 He is best cat
 Of course Hes already climbing up her
shoulder
cat Ooh that tickles
 I tell him to do a blep So he just does
this
 All right youre okay You can hang out
with Frumpkin for an hour

and I start booping each other on the nose
 I go and sit like  feet away and watch to
make sure everything is on the up and up
 Yeah
 Well if shes shown me everything of arcane
nature
person
 Were going to force perspective this shit
 Hello Twiggy
 Maybe three
 One is in Fjords gooch
 Oh Im very curious about it I would like
very much to see if shes willing to sell it or
part with it somehow
 I was not paying attention Has anyone said
how long it is until we reach land
 Maybe shell lend it to me
 This is still the same day correct
 Yeah hello your hour is up I need my cat
back now
 Okay Maybe another day though you can see
him again Im sorry that I used arcane trickery
on you May I borrow the Happy Fun Ball for a few
hours just to play with it
roll it to you
 If you want this to poop coins I dont
think you should do that too much
before
 Youve had it for a week
 Oh boy oh boy okay I wander off with it
to study it
 I rolled a  Sometimes it takes a while
for my mind to settle on truths and Im having a
hard time thinking about it right you know
maybe I will save this for later
 Ja
 Well you just have to tinker with it a
little bit Holy cats
 I pick up the jade
 Are you looking to sell this by any
chance
got
 So a good trade youre talking about
 What about Im going to throw out some
ideas here Im going to start spitballing
because Im very curious about this I love
puzzles What about some sort of mystical tattoo
 Many things
 I have been listening to my friend Jester
speak of them a lot All the time
fun stories
 That is true This one time she watched an
ant carrying a piece of bread six or seven times
larger than it up stairs
like that
 Ive never either but I take her word for
it because shes on the up and up Maybe you talk
to Jester about a mystical tattoo Thats one
thing on the table You could be an honorary
member of The Mighty Nein
friends
 I do too
hell let me Ill kiss him on the cheek
 

 Thank you
cat
 Hey you get the whole day

 Danke schn
  That was a fun time Good Im
short circuited from the kiss on the cheek Yeah
no I know its not helping 
 No Have you ever seen this before
 We dont see through
 No that is a very bad idea Twiggy
 If you want to make that arrangement with
your squirrel you are perfectly welcome but my
cat is not going in that hole  For the
moment Something Captain
 And its traveling with the boat
 Is there any lumber Theres no oars Are
there any rifles left on this boat or anything long
 Yeah rope is there rope
 Let me borrow that Im flustered I start
lowering rope down in maybe five or six feet
 And I pull it back out
 I dont know that its fine Theres a hole
to nowhere in the middle of the boat that came out
of Happy Fun Ball What do you call this thing
 No I am not going to put my hand in there
 I mean at the very least we need to put a
plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it
 Fjord First Mate Beauregard Im glad
youre here I want to introduce you to the new
honorary member of The Mighty Nein
 Yep The bigger the better
 I will say what we have learned on all our
travels on the ocean is the days are long and you
have to make your own fun
 Its getting more pokey
 Less smooth and spherical
 Does this thing every day sort of shrink
back in on itself or do you ever slide it back
together Or has it been getting more complex over
time
first stage so I dont know
 Oh okay
 It took me a few minutes to
 Oh okay
 To press oh 
 You could have been decapitated doing
that
 Keen Mind nah its a minute
 Are you readied
 What did you see Could you see
 Beauregard let me see this
 But its on the coat yeah
 Its the coat it is boots and the third
thing was
 Its a vault
 Here hold this I give her the doohickus
stuff and I walk with it very happily
 I also use an additional ten minutes to
touch the coat and cast Comprehend Languages on
this see if it says anything
 Well we have just robbed Halas
 Old magic Natural one
 Just roll with it though
 Okay are you ready
 Eins zwei drei 
 Which I am memorizing
 Yeah sure
 Somebody come on three rollers
 Were you in this ball
where I was All I know it was that big old
meanie Sir Cadigan who put me in there
wore this big ring with a green gem on it I
remember because he used to stick his fingers
through the bars to scare me
 Why dont you all take ten steps back and
well see what this next hinge does
 Oh investigation for it yeah
 Investigation 
 I would give me the advantage probably
 Oh shit
 Im at plus eight Yeah sure
 Remember that sphere
 I cast Mage Armor
 Theres no entrances or exits
 
 Yeah I have it
 Danke
 The lightning came out of here
 Did any of his friends get out
 Hey man you let strength be the dump stat
Hand could open them all if we felt like There
could be
 I have an idea I can make a magical hut
that nothing can pass through
 I am going to begin to take the minute to
cast Leomunds Tiny Hut in the center of the room
 Its a tenfoot radius and everyone is
allowed to enter and exit
 Absolutely But I have to stay in the center
of it where it is safe
 You can stick your hand through the barrier
and cast Mage Hand and pull back in yeah
 This is impervious to yeah
 Well get there We can experiment because
this is impervious
 It cannot come in here
 Oh hours That is a good point although I
have a decent supply of honeycomb We could knead
it up and make earplugs for ourselves
 Thats just as good or better You are
clever
 Before and after okay
 We are still safe in here Yeah I think
so
 We have heard everything that happened
outside of this bubble If it is wailing at us I
dont know what that would entail for us
 Yeah thats correct Nott you could at
least give it a whirl
 Picking that lock We are in here for
another seven hours and  minutes
 Youve got to follow through
 I am placing Frumpkin outside of the
bubble
 I am going to go look in the next room
 
 You know I could throw some light out
there but I dont really want to announce our
presence What do you think we should do
 He would have told me if he heard I cant
hear you
 I come out of it
 I dont want to really announce our presence
if theres somebody out there I dont know
 Caleb says nothing
 Im going to watch everyone safely go to the
door and not get killed and then drop the bubble
 It would stay there yeah
 Oh yeah if I leave its gone
 Hightail it out of this fucking room
 With your staff yeah
 Do I recognize it as an obvious arcane
effect
 Natural 
 Okay I relay this to the group We jumped
dimensions to get here and whatever is laying
before is not a hallway In a way it is but not
the traditional sense
 It might be yeah
 You said we can see the end of this
passageway but not whats beyond it
 
 Like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the
airport but way worse
 Ring based
 Nosebleed
 I think both of you should be taking a look
around in this moment
 The worst roll
 Old just like the device
 The red bubble This is some labyrinth shit
motherfucker
 I know a lot of people are doing a lot of
things but eventually get to me Im going to
start ransacking the desk for notes about that
 Im looking for a way to help Fjord right
now
 Six
 Oh shes in it
 I am going to trust my friends to take care
of the monster I have a feeling about the desk
This is what I would do I would think that there
might be something in this mans desk so I start
looking for anything of use
 It is a 
 Okay so then what I do is think
 All these
things can kill me I back away from the desk Im
going to move as far as I can away from the
dresser along this way
 No Im sorry I meant
 Exactly so yeah
 Thats it
 Fava beans
can I attack it from the inside using sneak attack
 Deborah can you be here every week

and six so another ten  total
 That cabinet had a mother
 Fjord Fjord

Nott
 Im going to join the women up top
 Are there any sigils or writing anywhere on
the frame of the window or in the window
 Balls Five
 I want to climb down the ladder and look for
anything not books right now but are there any
buttons or switches or anything out of place

 Perception or investigation Im looking for
hidden switches or
 
 So burned book and
open it with my magic hand Everybody stand back
 Nott Twiggy would you both come here

 Ja 
 We have to get Fjord out of that window
somehow
 Ill touch that book
 No
 Yeah
 I will make four globules of light and I
will try to put two of them on our side and two on
the other side
 I dont know if breaking it is  plus
straight add the intelligence 
 Its not here
 One of you little ones please would you
use your magical hand to touch theres a jar in
that drawer and there is a bottle of ink
 If they are safe to touch but dont use
your fingers
 That smaller desk

and are they free Do the books come off the shelf
even though theyre locked
 Try a single time
 Okay I put it in my bag
 Just do the two next to that one and then
well go

were either going to die or get out of here I
hope we get out of here
 I need them Lets go
 I climb up and Im screaming at Nott
 Lets
go
 Nott this is torture to me Lets go
 After you
 I take her finger and I push our fingers
together on it
 New campaign
 It was a red herring That was a trap
 You got the jake legs
 Only those present
 You rolled a six
 Plus his dex so nine total
 Plus that Plus six for your touch attack
so 
 It would kill me
 How high is the ceiling in here
 Wait that seems much higher than  feet
 Its hovering above Thanks
 Im with you now
 Two minutes later
 Nice
 Give it to Fjord hell touch anything
 Roll high
 He could hold an attack
 Halas Halas Halas
 You dont want to goldfish it
 Missile snare
 It was something last time

 Its cool
 Hes going to Blues Traveler it
 Twiggy is the only visible person
 Five little lit candles
 It went through the head
 Terrible
 Five
 Seven
 Minor question Do I smell burnt ozone
since you said that just a second ago
 Good enough
 Oh yes
wise
 Four
 Fuck I dont see Jester shes not here
 I dont see Twiggy I heard her voice
 Nott is up
 There is a dragon
 Im going to cast Expeditious Retreat and
since that is transmutation and I smell the
ozone as soon as I hit the ground I am going to
make my Transmuters Stone make me resistant to lightning
 I am going to beeline for the sphere
 Fuck
 Oh Okay Yeah we selfcorrected already
 Mercy kill Jester
 Double that sneak attack damage
 No ones going to believe her
 Fist fight
in reach Id like to take a tooth with me a
dragon tooth
 To burn the reaction yeah
 Twiggy do you have that jar of beads
have that jar of beads
 Are you attached to it
 Thank you
 I walk off
 I walk off
 Already gone
 You stowing away is that whats happening
whatevers attached to the dock and I wave and
 Halas
 Are you okay
  Would you jump up here
 Would you jump up
 Yeah
 Ill look at those tomorrow Lets go get
some sleep I start walking off towards our quarters
 What a fucking delight Twiggy was
 Descriptive
 Thanks for playing
 Ukotoa 
 A lot happened real fast
 Now were complete
 Do you know anything about this island Is
it large
 Mmhmm I think that I will stay behind on
the boat but I think you should go If you see any
incense I would appreciate it if you picked some
up
 Yeah probably Ja
 
 Did we not open them
 I think I actually will be all right
though
 Thank you
 I dont get the sense that a lot of
highquality paper and ink makes it to this
island but I have been wrong before so if you
see any would you bring some back and I will
reimburse you
 Im just going to take it easy today
 Yeah but you know I dont offer a lot of
muscle to this group but I do have a little bit of
knowledge So you know in situations like that
just give me a moment to have a look around the
room please Fjord Yes thank you Beauregard
 Lot of books
 Yeah maybe you were locked behind something
or there was some way to release it in the room
 Also were giving you a hard time but
there was no reason why I needed to keep fiddling
with this thing and I pat the satchel that I have
the ball in Could have left it well enough alone
 Thats deep in
  Hail seitan
 Test drive a Ford Practical today
 All those teenagers in hoodies are going
like
 Where else are you going to go
 Roll for Nic Cage
 I am a morning pooper so that happened at
the very beginning Once I watched Yasha leave the
boat I would have snapped Frumpkin to and set
him purring and worn him like a scarf Go back to
my chambers and slowly and methodically take out
the silver wire and cast Alarm outside of my
doorway Then take another ten minutes to cast
Leomunds Tiny Hut as a ritual in the room so
that the bubble goes up to the door Then I will
take out the jar of beads and the thing of ink
and the sphere from Twiggy I would rest that on
the table Then as memory serves there was one
book with arcane equations open on the table
which I put away Was there a second book on the
table at that point as well There was two we
got in our rush and Caduceus just gave him one
 I would set all four books down in a row
and the sphere is there and these two items
Stare at them
 After a minute of feeling Frumpkin purr away
and staring at them I say in my own language in
should probably get to work I sit down and I
will Identify the two items I will check out the
books and if any of them are locked I will cast
Knock on them to open them
 Bees or bees or bees
 And bees and bees
 Is the ink normal
 That is probably it I would
 Oh right Yes correct Yes lets inspect
the other three
 
 Thats two
 Eiselcross
 Not separated in any way just frozen over
to the north or is it separate
 Okay Well theres nothing else that I
would do I would say that all the time they were
gone he sits rolling the ball on the table and
speed reading these books Thats it
  Even Frozener Depths
 She can rage she doesnt need a shield
  Ball eater
 Matthew Mercers ball campaign
 What is the plan Captain
 Exactly
 It would be very embarrassing for the people
who designed that temple we visited
 Weve come a long way
 What are you going to do with the cat
 There is no bird or octopus he is a cat I
am out of supplies for hes a cat
 Everything just changed How much did you
get
 May I have it
 Thank you Where do we want to dump him in
the ocean again for a look around
 I can do two things We can send Frumpkin
into the air and
 Ill sit down on the deck and start drawing
in chalk on the wood and putting my cat in the
middle of it even though he has only been a cat
for a few days Ten minutes later we have an octopus
 Well try that sometime okay
 Not good
 Eight
 I see a whole lot of ocean
 
 Im going to send him in slowly larger
circles over time
 Now are we talking architecture or natural
 I relay this
 Theres more dead things down below
 That towers familiar to you huh
 So you misspoke
 Okay
 One of them seemed to spasm
 Most likely yeah
 Will you stay close to me down there
please
 Your first statement was accurate
 Yeah
 There was a jar full of theyre like boba
Its food
 It lasts a long time
 Yeah
 The ink is good it will help me in my
studies
 One of the books was about debate One was a
spell book
 And theres useful things in it
 A little yeah
 I pull her even a little further away and
turn our backs to the group and
 Thats fine Ive been getting a little
wrapped up in this team were working as a team
and Ive forgotten you and me Ive forgotten
 Yeah
 Stay close
 Caleb is standing behind Beauregard and
sliding his octopus onto his head
 Always stealthily
 Is anybody putting some juice on this No
Straight roll
 Thanks Thats plus ten
 Advantage
 Oh theyre both good Now even better 
 Well I can hit for sure but
 No
 Theyre wrapped up in the seaweed
 Are we sure we want to make a hit on these
things that are tangled up as opposed to this one
that is free floating
 Not that close
 Little over a hundred feet away
 Well you tell me As far as Im concerned
youre calling the shots here
 I could either focus what Im going to do on
one of them or I could tickle all of them
 It would just get their attention It would
not solve anything
 Okay Well I will aim for the one closest
I begin to weave my hands underwater and cast
Magic Missile
 Im casting at ndlevel
 Four beads of energy Nine nein points
of damage
 Oh  excuse me
 No Im nibbling on some licorice root and
casting Haste on Fjord and backing away
 Im going to try to do a bit of a science
experiment and cast Fire Bolt at the one next to
Beauregard and see if it even works down here
 Okay Ah no I rolled a two
 I move back
 
Careful they spit
 Whats left Whats
 Oh Magic Missile
 Yeah
 Hold on a minute Go Look around the
tower
 Yeah Hell spiral around look for any
other entrances Oh jeez it jumped on the box
cocked Natural one
 Thats what Ive been saying all this time
 I summon my octopus back to my head
 We did some talking
 You just went  and then its
gone
 Travis how are you going to handle the
shaft
 Start at the base
 Maybe we could send your friend in the door
at the bottom while we go in the top
 What do you propose
 I poof a little globule of light in my hand
and motion to Beauregard from far away and go
 I make three more
 How tall is the tower roughly
 Okay so I will stay  or  feet away from
the tower and I will send one in the top one in
the bottom and two through windows
  feet from you or from the temple
 I might be Youre always back
 Yeah Its a frontbottom
 The madness
 Oh my god
 That was my wife
 I forgot how to play
 Oh I rolled a natural  I did it I
remembered
 Yes I did
 This is after lighting up the inside and
then backing away from it Is that how it went down
 That was earlier
 
 I am going to use my movement to get behind
this rock and I am going to about  feet away
from Nott hold the Haste spell for the moment I
see her starting to attack something
 No to Nott
 Yep
 I was ascared and frightened
 Trigger Caleb casting Haste on Nott if I saw
her attack
 
 Im going to move half my movement so is
that three
 Im going to go one two three to here and
fire off Magic Missiles at this one by Yasha at a
level two
 All terrible rolls Its eight points of
damage
 Yeah thats it
 Yes I do plus  points of damage
 Yep
 Yeah With Spiritual Weapon yeah
 Is everyone attacking at disadvantage like
Yasha was
 Its okay Its just my teeth
 And were underwater
 I was backing away from the action but
seeing how the things are turning south I start
pushing back towards Miss Lionett through the
water I make it that far and Im going to cast
Magic Missile at level four
  
 The one thats backside is to me This side
No the one on Beauregard here
 Thats the end of my turn
 Its short Its  feet I remember
 Character drops Fuck this bullshit
 Double that
 Cocked Its very cocked
 Youre able to read peoples thoughts after
that
 Ive been on my way over to the scrum over
there trying to help and I begin to weave Magic
Missile again and he is about to cast it and the
unleashes on the one right behind him Magic
Missile level three Yeah I need one more

  total
 Im not going to move because it will claw
me in half
 No that hits sorry I was going
backwards
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Ten
 What if the roll had actually been
shite  Would that have changed it
 Because I have the transmuters stone which
is giving me proficiency on constitution saves if
Im remembering correctly
 Proficiency in constitution saving throws
Thats what I have
 Theres a slight crooked little smile
peeking out from underneath Frumpkin on my head
 The queen
 Caleb pulls up and theres claw piercing all
along the ribs
 Caleb sits down in the muck
 
This is Grass Talk on KCRW
 I need a short rest
 Yes please
 I am dropping and leaning against
Beauregard
 Did one of you do healing and I missed it
 You would advise coming
 She wants us to rally below It is gross on
the way down but okayish
 I crawl down
 There is no guarantee there is another
temple somewhere with another person with dreams
like you and Avantika who has already done this
This could be the final piece of the puzzle if we
understand the carvings we saw correctly even We
dont actually know do we
 Im going to start looking around
 
 An empty standalone sphere
 Agate AGATE
 Potion sphere feathershaped stone and an
agate stone
 Thats four things Plus the coins
 Its a stone shaped like a feather
 Does it look like this sphere that Ive
found is the same shape as this
 I will alert everyone that this stuff it
down here I gathered up all of the things that
are not coins
 No
 Are we going to take the time do that now
 I will need some time I heard you
whispering about this bauble so I will begin on it
 Well if someone has seen us through it
they already have
 In theory I sat down on the floor oh
shoot I cannot do it now because my books are in
your bag If I take them out they would be
ruined
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Too clean to be normal
 Caduceus Can you talk to this dead person
 By the time we clear the room there would
not be much time left to that spell
 You know him pretty well
 You still mean to veer away from all this
once were done here
 Im going to expend a use of Expeditious
Retreat on myself which will A make me a little
bit quicker I would change the nature of the
Transmuters Stone to let me see in the dark and
I send Frumpkin to glomp onto Fjords arm and
shoulder
 Hes on his way we should already start
moving
 Im swimming quickly ahead of everyone
because Im Expeditious Retreat
 Ive shot ahead a little bit if its under
ten minutes since Ive cast
 Can I ask a question
 Watching through Frumpkins eyes as he did
everything down below other than hearing Fjord
talk without his twang did I see the tendril that
appeared or was that all in his mind
 So just heard him speak and heard him wedge
a sword in the ground
 That was my first DD character
 No dont open that
 You were only warned six times before you
put it in your mouth
 Looks like someone who waited for us to do
the hard work
 Into the ocean
 He said at advantage
 Oh my god its cocked You dont get to
keep it but it was like  fuck you at an angle
 And they are more than four times further
away than that
 Im the boatswain
 What are we doing Captain
 For everybody with a thing to do Because I
dont think I have a thing to do so I could just
hang out
 Im going to start Identifying spells Im
rifling through Jesters
 If they get in range
 In sixsecond rounds I dont think were
in traditional
 
 What are you eating
 To maintain distance
 How long is your Water
 So if we maintained speed with that and
theyre a fast boat
 Well it creates a wave for sure
 Thats what I was worried with Avantika
about
 Its a  percent chance of capsizing
 Three zero Roll the dice
 What do we see in the way of survivors
swimming about
 Theyre very far away Eight
 Do we want to grab one or two of these
people so we know what was going on in the first place
 We got a boat now baby This is going down
 That boat is as dead as a nothic

 
 I can kind of do that You have to get them
in a circle and keep them at bay for a moment
 The Cock Gobbler
 Yes they attacked a ship after a gigantic
geyser of water spewed forth from the ocean Id
say they stuck their dick in it yeah
 We could try to turn them in and they could
take them and us at the same time
 May I have my books back please before you
draw googly eyes in the pages Did you already
draw googly eyes in the pages
 I certainly do
 Thank you Beauregard
 I will go back to Nott and my quarters and
pull out the book and take less than an hour to
theres five things now
 It was the stone shaped like a feather It
was the orb It was a potion It was the agate
stone and the studded leather armor
 Busy
 Busy
 You guys are on deck right Im not there
 Caleb wanders back up at this point and
starts listening
 Im sorry Im coming into this midway Am I
to take it we are headed to the mainland
 Oh thats good news
 Oh that is a good idea So you dont mean
to pursue this any further right now
 I was going to ask you does it concern you
to turn away from this things desires Do you
worry it will abandon you Leave you a mere mortal
again
 But you intend to leave the sea for now
 You dont even know do you
 Ive been in the ocean for days and days
 First I want you to admit that I have been
washed from top to bottom for a month
 You are a nice fellow
 You see
 Revved up It was very interesting Im so
tired There is one of these things that I am
going to keep
 Its a lucky rock
 There is another thing here that I probably
should keep but I dont have to This bauble
lights up and floats and lets us see in the dark
 Yeah hovers a bit
 I set it floating five feet above the deck
of the ship
 It is tawaj
 Not exactly but its dark at this point
isnt it
 So if I say fajar
 Very specific use cases for that I pluck it
out of the air and it should dim One of you
could carry it but since I am normally blind as a
bat Beauregard has her glasses
 All right so I will take both of these
things
 A lucky rock yes
 No it does not let you reroll things
 This is a potion that makes one extremely
strong for a short period of time
 Fjord Yasha
 I honestly was thinking Yasha and if not
Yasha then you Jester
 I stick that into my pocket Thats just a
loaner in my pocket I dont want it Caduceus I
thought this would be good for you Im holding up
a small stone leaf I hand it to him Dont put
that on the deck please because it will turn
into an actual tree
 It doesnt say on here I assume
 Oh one time only
 And then Beauregard this armor you found
is quite exquisite but you dont wear armor do you
 No its a bit hard to do all the flipping
around that you do
 Yeah it would be good for any of you This
particular one was a little better at protecting
you but also you can speak to this thing and make
the armor look like anything you like
 It would be yeah but it doesnt work for
monks You can make it look like robes or the
fanciest golden armor you can think of or a
clowns outfit or you can make yourself look like
Fjords clothes Its an instant change of
clothes
 Its clothes though its clothes
 Yeah thats the first thing I said Its
above average
 Studded leather plus one
 And its endless its limitless Am I
reading that right
 Should we give this to Yasha Fjord Jester
This potion
 You should take a look at the mote and I
will assist you if you care
 Do we want it to be one of us
 It costs a lot
 Oh youre going up
 Do you like a good book
 I dont mean for tonight In general
 But you have One of the books that we found
in that ball of fun is about the corruption of plants
 I thought you might be
 Surely
 Mmhmm Im glad you are traveling with us
 Just a happy little scry
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That it
 Ja If you want to take some time with
that and then we could use it sure
 Okay
 Okay No time like the present Lets go get
to work
 One of the nights while getting into bed
and Nott curling up at the foot of the bed as we
customarily do
 Ja Ill wait in the dark and before I
 How do you feel about returning home
 So were just going to buzz through Theres
nothing you want to check in on or
 Sometimes it sounds like you dont have much
love for home
 One of your clan
 Not one of your clan
 Oh okay
 No
 Well not besides you
 Not besides you That clan is all right with
you Was there any friction that we should be
 Oh So you want to go home briefly but not
to see the clan but just this one fellow
 You are very
 So were going around your home is what
youre saying
 Ja Whatever you need Whatever you need
well do
 It was pretty interesting though You did
quite well out there I mean obviously you were
like a goblin in water but you did quite well out
there
 I am very pleased with that
 Im also impressed with you You have a
knack You have the knack I would know
 No Magic
 Im proud of you
 Good night Nott
 Oh my gosh Thursday
 show Friday
 art
 Are we making any attempt to hide our
persons disguise our persons
 Six inches shorter brown hair no beard
and brown robes like the simplest student
 Jester
 What about a place that has writing
materials Paper and ink and that sort of thing
 Are you going to come along
 That is exactly what weve done Youve been
to this place before but when you were a child
Maybe youve forgotten the way
 Did you get out Did your mother take you
around or did you have maybe a babysitter
 Before we go in
 you never went out or
just rarely You mean just rarely went out
 What about just outside of the Chateau Did
you go out to play
 Well lets see what books
they have inside here
 Before I step forward I lean down to the
ground snap my fingers and bring Frumpkin the
say hello to that cat And he scuttles off
 Russo you said
 Rusan oh My apologies I am looking to buy
a bit of paper Quite a bit but whatever you
might have Also do you specialize in a kind of
book here or is it a wide array Whats your
specialty Whats your favorite
that you have for sale
 History of the area of Nicodranas itself I
would be interested in reading Anything you have
of arcane nature I would be especially interested
in even if it was just histories of
 Well I will look through your fictional
works and also history if you have it
 Okay Well priority one is I deal
in prose and poetry quite a bit so I need
a good amount of basic blank paper
for my work
 I am working up the courage for that point
I am almost ready I just have to take that first step
 I am pink I sometimes stink I need to
think I want to get out of this store right now
 So just the paper I suppose
 Ooh Now DM question I have that ink
from the library that can take basicass paper
and have it serve the purpose of  gold
worth of that highquality paper
 Okay I would like to buy that
specific amount of paper I want to
 The equivalent of which would be
much less I assume
 Yeah we make that yeah
 While he is making those trips
I will find one interesting fictional work
and also any history book on Nicodranas
that I can find
 Edubational
 Please dont But I do want to have that
 Oh what do I owe you For all
the paper and these two books
 Excellent Okay so I hand that over
 Where are we going to stay tonight
do you think
 That would be helpful
 
 Well it was a little contentious
when we left but I
 Samesies
 Ja Nott do you want to contact the
others and let them know where
oh theyre too far away Jester
 Are you going to pick any fights
with anybody today
 Did you want to stay for a while though
A few days
 Pardon me After tonight we could find
another place give you a day or two with your mother
 We did not bring it back
 You two are very curious about that tower
 What have you heard about it
for Fjord and Beaus benefit
 Well thats true but I feel
theres a difference
 Ja The movement of it
 Of course one is a building ja
 Can I make out from the spine or the cover
what book she was reading that she set down
 Books books books
 
 I dont think that is a good idea
 We need to dial it back a little bit
Weve been going at an  out of ten
for a while We need to slow down
 What lazy roleplaying
 You know Im going to stay here and
do a little bit of reading so if you
want me to watch your dog I will
 While I read
 I feel a little uncomfortable Who are we
talking about You
 No but go find out what you can about this
place and get your shopping done Ask about the
tower Subtly
 Mm no
 Watch the dog 
 Okay You want to do some spell research
with me Come on Come on Frumpkin
 You are in charge You are the guard cat
Dont let him push you around I start to read and write
 Im not here but just out of curiosity
 The
change in size is it slight that you just barely
notice it or is it like Whoa whoa
 So its impressiveness is in the extreme when
youre right there with it
 Okay
 Oh my god
  I will never come out again
 How long were roughly did all this mess
last before they come back How long have I
been in the room
 Ugh Okay
 Im busy Come back later
 I would have been in whatever chambers were
given to us so if Caduceus came in with that
potion I barely nodded and just kept doing what I
was doing
 Frumpkin is bushed out The tail is bushed
out Its all over and is just staring at Nugget
 What kind of wood is it
 Everyone besides Quebec

 What door what are you talking about
 No I didnt eat with you
 No
 Before we go down that road may I ask
what is our actual purpose that we are
not telling him about Why are we doing this
 Ja
 So we are going to go in and case
the joint to rob him blind
 I do too there is a war brewing in the
Empire it is going to spill south That is not a
lie that is an inevitability So I feel that we
can talk to him and trust me no one in this room
is more curious about the inside of that tower
than I am but to what end are we doing this Like
are we going to go to the hilt are we going to
slay this mage and take his books or make nice
conversation and steal a book It seems like
 Caduceus is very soothing to listen to
 Well I am curious and Beauregard is
correct that it is something we could legitimately
talk about without spilling the beans about
everything that everyone has got going on with
themselves and I am of course curious I just
want to make sure You know Ive talked about
calculated risks before and I dont want to run
willynilly towards folly like we have done with
the boat We are all standing here
but that was foolish
 We just dont need to be too pushy
 Yeah well potentially he could turn us over
to people that we are not interested in
turned over to But Im not saying no
lets just be careful thats all
 I dont think so
 Like the early colonies here
 We had a walkandtalk just now
 Can we tell from where we are if hes
human or elven or
 
 Did he just hear that entire conversation
 What
 For what
 Oh god I need to stress eat Get it open
 Caleb puts away the romance novel
that he has sped read halfway through
 Its the goblin at the door not this mage
 Can we all see him from where we are
 Total poker face
 Caleb takes the rear
 Im Caleb Widogast
 Hmm
 Hmm
 Via circles of arc Transportation you mean
to jump from one city to another That sort of thing
 Not as of yet
 Here in your home
 You have some knowledge of
where that leads
 You know him personally
 Caleb extends his hand out slowly
 Thank you
 Once you have earned our trust
 This one has sentimental value
It is not to be left here
 We have a better understanding of this one
 I take him at his word that he could
kill us all if he wanted to If he wanted
to take it against our will he would
I am comfortable with you examining it
but we dont wish to leave it here
We wish to bring it with us when we leave
 Very bad people want this thing
 Ill promptly follow
 Ja
 One way
 Oh DM question
 I dont know what
level off the top of my head Teleportation
 So how much time
 Right
 No Oh Sorry
 Yes I do have it but it would
take me a lot of hours
 I mean he would look at it for
a minute and have the rune in his head
 Mostly on my own to be honest
For years
 It was not my intention to bother
you here My friends were very curious
 It was fairly obvious to me that this building
was real estate owned by someone of great skill
 I actually thought it was a very
bad idea to come here
 Sometimes follow my friends
places I shouldnt
 Well my apologies on my groups
presumptuousness I hope that we have not
made a grave error here today and if we
havent I hope to earn that trust as you say
 Thats good advice
  Im sure you have much to do today
 Feel for the wall
 That eventually spills out down here
 Cinnamonamonamon
 Come on We are quitting while were ahead
lets go Oh streusel
 We talked about you guys actually
 I didnt say anything I listened
 No
 I say you are foolish
 We are lucky that we are not dead
 Were very lucky the way it worked out
You cant bullshit everyone in this world
 We got luck
 How did it go What kind of conversation
did you have before we got in there
What did you guys talk about
 But lets stay in one place for a few days
first right Before moving on That way we could
stay a few days when we get there Dont want to
run off Your mother misses you she wants
to see you She wants to spend time with you
 One more day Or youll regret it
 Just for future plans and operations a mage
of that skill level will know if a familiar is
if someone is staring at him He invited two
in not three Heres my cat  Out here
That was not a good idea Im sorry I
didnt mean to hurt your feelings
 Yeah
 It took four days to get here weve
done it before we would have known this
was going to happen Not the amount of
security but that there was security
 Super specific so far
 Ikithon
 I didnt meet him
 I walk over while shes training the
dog Hes getting very good at that
Youre doing a good job
 I really dont like dogs Im sorry
I finished this book I thought
you might like it Its about romance
at sea with a sailor
 Did I get a name for it If I did
Liam does not remember it
 I was going to say The Salty Sea Nuts but
I was like Im not going to say that out loud

 Thats it Enjoy
 I got one too
 On a different night I assume
were camping every night ja
 Just for setting
 May I borrow you for a word
 Mmhmm
 I was very brusque back in Nicodranas
with you  Im sorry
I felt very exposed with that man Um
 I was just collecting my thoughts
 With a man like Yussa if he wanted to find
us maybe not me but the rest of you he will
and I do not know his allegiances or his motives
or anything Neither did you none of us did
There are people who would flay me like a cat
if they could get their hands on me so
 No but he was hard to read
  I dont know Beauregard
 But I dont like to not know I like
traveling with you people and I dont want to take
unnecessary risks so Im not telling you what to
do I could not tell you what to do but if
for me to stay with you all I cant keep poking
my head up like a mole from a hole in the ground
because someone is going to cave my skull in if I
do it in the wrong place and if you all are with
me you will die with me That man in Rexxentrum
he would spread my guts out onto the stone floor
if he could get his hands on me now if he knew
where I was so I factor that into all of my
thinking everywhere we go Everywhere I have been
for five years I have been looking over my
shoulder so its not really fair to all of you
because we are linked like this now He is
arguably the most powerful man in the Empire
 Ikithon I just wanted you to understand me
better As much as I am able to have friends
I like you all right I dont people very well
I am well aware Its been a long time since I had
a lot of practice but I have to be careful and
if we cant be careful enough I have to go
 That is beside the point
 Yes it is very much beside the point
Because if I care for any of you at all and that
man in the northern end of this Empire knows where
any one of you are he knows he can get to me
If he finds us you all will just be thrown
into the fire with me
 Were talking around each other That is not
the point that I am arguing I am saying that
if we are going to stay together we have
to be careful Careful
 Just persons like that one in that tower
 You know in the abstract I am
but the problem with friends is that
you have to care about them
And I wander away
 Well Im going to go stand in front
of a tree for  seconds and do this

 You passed
 We have grown since the last time
we rolled through this town
 Hes  Shes 
 Not a whole thing but Ive gone through
most of the paper purchased and read the history
of Nicodranas  the general
knowledge of the history of Nicodranas
  Their main export
is oysters Carry on
 I knew I should have gone with entertainment
as the subject You get a piece of the pie
 Do I recognize that person from
my time at school
 Sorry I didnt hear you there
 
 I recognize them
 One more time please
 These are names I got on a list over
a year ago that Im remembering now
 Im going to go fucking dig through
my emails Jesus
 Were fine Were just going into Notts
backstory I dont need to review nothing
 If that is the case and were in the wagon at
this point Caleb just fucking lies down in the cart
 Yeah Lies down in the cart
 Where are the nearest guards
at this moment
 They walked off
 Im going to hop out of the cart go over
to Nott and trip Fall face flat into the dirt
Wipe dirt on my face and into my beard
stand up and pull my hood up
 Yes Im going to start searching
through the rubble
 Ill helm it
 Holy shit Lets roll this die
Ooh two s That is a 
 Im casting Mage Armor
 Or blood or injury
 Thats the Mighty Nein special
 Shes Will Grahaming it
 Lets get out of here Lets take it to
have you ever seen this before
 May I
 How does your friend fit into all of this
 Caleb absolutely pukes
in the middle of the room
 The haversack is limited right
 That Fjord is in possession of
 Who has it I will gladly carry it
 Is there anything in my time of torture and
awful that would tell me what this chair is
 No I dont mean a magic chair I mean
the setup in the room the mess around it
  Hey Caleb
 I like tortles
 Before we leap in could you give a quick
physical description again of the two archmages
 Also elven
 At the apothecary not where we are
Two separate locations
 We need to go now Right now
 These things we have we
have to get them out of here
 Now please
 We heard someone describe the operatives
from Xhorhas coming up out of the ground
over by the farmlands correct
 Yeah thats a good question but also we
just stole some very important things and we saw
what is probably the owners going into the
building Is there anything we need to do in this
town now to help you do what you need to
do here or can we leave
 Is this person youre looking for here
do you know Do you have any ideas
 We were being stared at as we
came through here
 Is anyone else Is there anyone
coming Do we hear anything
 Natural one
 By the farmlands
 Are we going to
 I dont want to talk in town
 What do you think that your child
made of that
 Cut off the is
 Were in the wagon
  Mist
 Your name is Veth
 My name was Bren Aldric Ermendrud Was
 I uh
 I have been using you all
 I am from Rexxentrum I attended the
Soltryce Academy and I was plucked by one of the
Cerberus Assembly with a few others and was
being trained to do the kinds of things that
I fear may have been done to
 Ja And a lot of big plans for me
that didnt pan out and I went a little crazy
And I ran away I ran away Ive been on the run
for a long time and I was tired of starving
And I met I met you and was a little less
hungry for a while I have just been afraid for
a long time and two of the people in that town
over there are on the Cerberus Assembly
 I know who they are
 I dont think so but I have walked past
their portraits at school many times
 One of them is the head of the
Cerberus Assembly
 Theres good teachers there Its everything
that they describe it to be but after going there
for several months one of the Assembly who also
would teach on occasion started interviewing me
calling me in and asking me a lot of questions He
put me in advanced class me and a few others
I dont want you all to be seen with me because
if you are seen with me by one of them
they will use you to get to me
 You met the man who trained me 
His name is Trent Ikithon
 Im not a very good person
 Im worried about your husband I know
the things that they can do
And I start to unwrap one of my arms
 No I have been wearing bandages
on my arm and there are little very faint
scars all up the arm
 They are scars faint scars from cuts
 He used to put crystals in he experimented
on us on the three of us
 He was trying to strengthen us
 No The first time I had ever seen that
word was in your libraries just haphazardly
scrawled into a book no explanation No
everything was for Empire We were being trained
to serve our Empire above all else He was a
little mad himself That is he was mad
 He believed that the unwashed masses relied
on their base instincts and the highest calling
was to rise above the muck and control the cattle
for the good of all
 But we were are at war Many of us
felt that way feel that way
 I dont believe in anything now
 Yes I dont want one more thing on my head
to have you guys its probably too late anyway
 The Cerberus Assembly are the most powerful
mages in the Empire Over two centuries ago a
number of mages went to war in the streets of
Rexxentrum It was bloody and awful and
eventually they came to a truce and banded
together and proposed to the king at the time
that they serve as an advising body
alongside the throne
 I dont know for sure but there is a reason
why I did not use anything like that back there
 I dont know It is something to do
with the thing
 But I dont know why him
 Was he gifted In his work
 That is what is written about there it
talks about Listen I dont pretend to know what
were talking about but it does not seem like
anything that I ever studied
 It says they were looking for a way to
achieve their ends without the object I dont
know what they need I hope he is alive I truly
do They will make his life very painful though
 Ja
 The city of Rexxentrum
 Theyre based there
 And the Empire They are close to as
powerful arguably more powerful than the King
 We watched Lunidus Daleth appear 
 feet in front of us
 Maybe
 I used a lot of names Caleb is just what I
told you
 I dont know Caleb lets stick
with Caleb for now
  I honestly dont know if we
can if we are up to this Unless theyre
en route on land maybe but thats 
all the might of the Empire
 Theyre both elves
 Vess DeRogna Im sorry no Vess DeRogna is
the Archmage of Antiquities She is half a recluse
She taught at the school not me or
years above me
antiquities
 Shes a historian She knows she has
uncovered mysteries of the past they would say at
school Shes a history buff and
awful as well probably
 Daleth is Domestic Protection He is the
head of the military If they are both here
I would imagine that he is here overseeing all of
the Red Brands we saw and she is probably here
trying to figure out whats in that bag
 They could be combing the Empire for it
 Thank you
 
 More than one yeah
 We saw an attack on the tower in Zadash
That was ages ago at this point And now theyre
well into the Empire
 What about the annexes
 The annexes People who it was in the lore
that you shared with me
 These papers conjecture that in Ghor Dranas
they are able to control fate and time Clearly it
was stolen from them and brought here so it could
be the source of their presence here
 Ja it was a note scrawled to the side of
a book It said that the Cerberus Assembly was
looking into some sort of new arcane study and the
word dunamis was written That was it
 I was studying history and I need to
become more powerful if I want to do anything
 Look at me I am a string bean I am weak as
it comes I am weak Look at that Look at her
 You have no guns That was an exaggeration
that day You are just fast and quick and talented
 Ja
  I Oh Jester I am glad you see
good in me
 Okay
 I will consider it heavily
 I dont doubt any of you at all 
 You too
 That one will be offcamera
 The elder gentleman started the Cerberus
Assembly over  years ago
 Thats a tangible goal that we can do
 It all depends on how he reacts if Caduceus
is able to contact him
 A couple of us tonight not me but a
couple of us could check the town out and ask
some questions and ask if many people were taken
away or not
 Hood up and Im still dirty as sin
 I have a decent amount of molasses
if you like
 Well one is the bee poop but molasses
comes out of a tree
 The umlauts over the second F
 Hey Laura Hey Laura Thats a pretty good
penis you drew over there Its very lifelike
 Looks like some stuff happened there too
 Pretty good
 Are you talking about what Nott and I do
or what you do
 Thats between you and your god Jester
 Is it dark yet
 Im no expert on worms but I would imagine
that it is more collapsed earth than open space
 They chew their way their way through the
earth and poop out the remains
 We dont know We dont really know
 Yeah but they can do that in a basement
 We have no idea how deep the blockage goes
 We plan everything
 To do
 I did not say that it is heavily fortified
although Im sure it is It is the largest city
in the empire When I lived there and it was
only briefly when I was at school I could go
anywhere in the city I wanted because
Im a citizen of the empire
 The largest city in the empire
 That would be hard to attack
 Not the name Not the group None of it
 
 Little floating trombones
 
  Ask about the chair
 Ghor Dranas Xhorhas
 I also had notes and I read a book at the
Cobalt Soul about Xhorhas I have all that
 Oh 
 Beast folk What do you mean
 Have you ever heard of something called the Luxon
 The Luxon
 Im not sure I read about them or it I
dont what it is Something that is having some
sort of negative effect on the people of
Ghor Dranas
 This everything weve been talking about
It says in there that they control fate and time
 Ja I have read this All around Ghor Dranas
 An empress runs it named Leylas Kryn
 We are focusing on your fellow
 There are beasts in the north
but Yeza is not
 Gentlemen we cant fight in here
 Nott can you make yourself look like him
 He seems like an interesting fellow
 Thats a symbol The persons
more important
 So we have to come up with a plan
for what we are doing
 Rexxentrum is its own set of problems and
dangers Your husband is heading towards Xhorhas
and a war I am not feeling very optimistic about
the tunnels but I have been wrong about many
things So why dont we check out the tunnels
Lets do something positive
 Should we hire someone to go with them
as muscle
 Take care of your family
 Thats two stop its tonight
 Well I imagine the same guards will be out there
again Are we just going to plunge on in and try to
 We just won Dungeons  Dragons guys
 Well be lucky if we can proceed I dont
think we can take the cart with us
 Its worth just checking the box Perhaps it
connects to a larger cave system that they used
we dont know but the cart cannot come
 Yeah I will cover the cost of that
 Excuse me how much would it cost to house
our cart here for a month
 A month
 Not a problem Here you are One Two
 For a brief period of time yeah Brief
 Yeah for a minute
 Oh jeez
 Creatures
 All the way to the right Creatures
 Creatures is over here so Actions 
blah blah blah all of them are right
 Tap it and then search Just start typing in a name
 Then use Google
 For a badger a honey badger
 As high as challenge rating what
 Get us to the Underdark Laura
Take us to the Underdark
 Pick pick pick argh
 Oh this new item
 It follows me
 I know I was just curious about my new
Okay
 Yeah and the tripod
 No
 The hole that was dug by our honey badger
 Yeah
 As a point can I tell if were walking into
any bullshit
 Ja okay Real bad
 nine
 No Im going to pull them back to me and
lose three of them and pull out that rag that I
carry around and cover them so that its even
dimmer My transmutation stone is set so that
I can see in dim light
 Who wants to walk with me
 Do you hear anything Do you see any kind of
traps left behind
 The people could put them on the ground
or anywhere
 From everything I read Ghor Dranas is
mysterious and exotic so lets press on
Im going to start walking forward
 Da da da
 They might have a little minibase
 I dont like it it makes me nervous
 Argh damn it Selffulfilling prophecy
 I rolled a one
  Six
 Yeah Plus two
 I have  hit points I am invincible
 Spell Sniper man
 Hes healing at distance 
Hes healing for speed
 Cheers
 Thats not happening here He is a cat No
but I have this rag over one of my its dim but
maybe you and I can stand near the middle
 Yeah but we need to weigh the risks
we are facing and Notts husband
 There are also people behind us
topside whod kill us for this as well
 If we are lucky we will overtake
them before we return to their home
 I have a question for you Jester You know
how you have just turned yourself into the
oversized honey badger
 Could you do that to a giant worm but say
turn it into a cow
 Ja Rather than trying to whack away at a
gigantic worm maybe you just make it harmless
but not so little that it loses its new form
 Yeah a goat
 I think something small is likely to get
smacked and taken out of its newer form It would
need to be something that could take a bit of
punishment
 Like that Or a cow
 Everybodys doing it
 Well I will tell you
 Its in the book
 Has any of the crystal been broken away by
the worms passage through here
 Does any of it look of value as a
rare stone
 
 Im going to scoop up a handful of them
 Make it the same color as the crystals that
are here and then I can also set an Alarm around us
 For us yeah but not from the outside
 I can camouflage it to match this room
 Yeah so its not such a perfect
round surface
 If we leave an area where we can
pop our heads out if need be
 Did you say you were going to carve a hole
to put it inside of or should I make it against
the side of the chamber
 Okay
 I take out my book and I slap it down on
the stone surface of this chamber we are in I
take about ten minutes and then there is a
hemisphere that is the same color as the chamber
around us As soon as that is done I then take
out the silver thread and I start making a little
white picket fence thats not actually a
picket fence in front of that
 I also send Frumpkin out of the hut to sit
in the shadows of the chamber and I tell him to
come and wake me up if he hears anything coming
further than the perimeter of the alarm
 Legitimate question because I dont
want to dick with the story youre weaving
but does Keen Mind cut through that
 It wont mean anything to them
Theyll be
 Frumpkin also skips up Notts back and
snuggles in grips her clothing with her claws
his claws damn my original cat
and scarfs around Notts neck
 Mage Armor
 Weve been traveling for miles though
 Thats true I know which way is north
Its that way
 No but the whole time weve been walking
Ive been conscious of which direction north is in
 From where we are I dont know if I can
because I can only see from this little bit of
dim light but where from this chamber the
worm continued on straight through
 Cant see the other side
 Maybe gave it a runaround in here
like a dog in a dog park
 Ja but how much time do you need
to dig up this cave
 Ropers
 Oh my gosh
 We are in the kill zone yall
 I would be by the largest grouping of people
because Im scared of everything
 This is real bad
 Well
 You dont know I dont know
  for Caleb
 Yeah
 Shield
 Does not hit
 Yeah
 That hits
 Caleb says
 
 And shes smiling on you
 Is that all the s Is that all the
s in a row
 One handed Caleb gets the molasses
out and starts smearing it and casting
 Im going too late and I cast Slow
on both of them
 
 Wisdom yeah
 He can do one thing per round now
while thats up Yeah it just brought all
those tentacles down to one thing per round
 Fails
 A negative two penalty to AC and
dexterity saving throws Cant use reactions
It can use either an action or a
bonus action not both
 
 Im getting the molasses everywhere
 Ooh it was almost a one
and then it was better
 Negative two AC and dex saves
 Were on the move ja
Hup hup hup
 Im going to keep my eyes behind us
where we just ran away from
 Its a minute duration
 Okay Magic Missiles
 I said Magic Missiles but I dont have that
prepared so Im going to throw Fire Bolt at it
 Natural 
  for me
  total
 Say goodnight Grimace
 Everybodys in a line shaking their
heads at this thing
 Should we look for their babies
 Hows that tunnel coming
 Need it a lot
 Did I mention Im a monk
 And pavement
 Dancing Lights is up
 We can do the same
 Oh its hold on a second
 I cant remember Almost there
Tenfoot radius yeah
 Well repeat everything and I will
send Frumpkin up ahead of us  feet
to stay up all night as a guard to come
running back in if need be
  for Frumpkin
 Also all throughout the day once
 An hour goes by
 Its 

 An hour later
 Dingdong dingdong
 You took a lot of courage to go in I was
not very helpful in that regard either You did
not tell us what was going on Why would you
You still went in for a long time So sorry
 Oh Its nine oclock
 Ah six
 Good cat
 Youre bored
 Really Look at this Frumpkin gets
up onto his hind legs and does a little

 You know you are a very good reader
You give it a lot of character
 Do they bear any resemblance
to the giant hole that we were following
 Oh behind us
 How high off of the ground is that hole
 We can bail if we wanted to perhaps
 Well not going to Xhorhas and
getting murdered by far greater forces
  but I think were going to Xhorhas
 There is really only one reason
to use the side tunnels
 To leave
 You can do that anywhere
 Only if we wanted to give up which
we are not doing so we go forward
 Quite a ways but if he gets too far away I
no longer have the ability to communicate with him
 Ja okay
 Sure
 Ja but advantage with smell
if theres anything stinky
 Put the ribbon on the backside
so its not right in his eyes
 For the first ten seconds Frumpkin goes

 But gets used to it and then trots off
 I did I rolled twice so its a 
perception
 Is there any immediate reaction to a glowing
cat entering into this big chamber
 I cant hear anybody
 How many chambers are
Is it just many many
 Im just watching I can no longer send
commands I can only go along for the ride
to watch Am I seeing anything like
mining equipment
 Okay
 Okay I leave him there and come out of it
 Well its a good walk a ways
and then there is a larger chamber with
many different exits to it and my good boy
saw some sort of creature in a cage
 Wuh
 Hard to tell
 Yeah
 Or this is an old abandoned place You know
I dont know what the right thing to do is because
if we keep following this tunnel we could roll
right up into their backyard where they ended
their journey walk right into them However
we dont really know where this place is going
we dont know how far it is from where your
husband is going to be We dont know
what dangers are above us However we could
come in and try to find him not walking directly
into their line of sight right into their face
or their butt or whathaveyou
I dont know what the right thing to do is
 That is a good point
 We didnt take the side with
Frumpkin Just confusion thats fine
 Well he knows to come back in five minutes
if he does not hear from me so we have to wait
 About how far away from me has
Frumpkin gone at this point
  or so feet 
Pull him back I dont know
if they saw him or not he is glowing
  Little lizard people down
that way and they saw my cat
 I will take the other side of it
and do the same thing
 Oh a 
 I pull out a small little stone pyramid
in my hand and mutter a few words
and then cast Tongues and
speak to this little thing
 Thats the best
 Did I hear something like
Look at these motherfuckers out there
 Wait just to specify from up where
Frumpkin just was from that direction
Or multiple directions
 Theyre in the honeycombs in
the ceiling right
 Yeah
 Mage Armor
 We have come to speak I say in whatever
language I now understand and speak
 Oh I made it very clear and held my hand
 We have come through to chase a large
serpent through these caves and eradicate it
 Easy
 We are here looking for a scourge
in these mountains Oh boy
We mean you no harm We wish to pass through
 In Draconic saying well
but my friends can make more
food than me I am
 I take two steps forward
 Okay
 Two steps forward thats an 
 I only take this as a minor setback
We can still work this out
 You do not want to tangle with the spirits I
command I snap my fingers and Frumpkin appears
and four globules of light float
in a circle around Frumpkin
 Intimidation Thats a 
 You will be cursed for decades
 You expect me to hand over one of my own
 This cat will burn you burn you all
 No its in Drac well I dont know
Im speaking through a spell so
 So were all on the same page
 Oh thats excellent
 Frumpkin stands and does that little
 The Fey King is growing angry with you and
the globules of light start to spin a little quicker
 Is that d
 Do you know who is caged up aways down this
tunnel
 Oh its in this room
 Oh I see Got it
 I tell you what Do you want this creature
 I will make one last offering to you
I will give you the Fey King
in exchange for this creature here
 Deception you said
 
 He will bring blessings to your people
 Okay Take the f okay Telepathically I
buddy In my head and he trods forward
 We have food the creature in the cage
 I pick it up
 Sure but Im not zooming
into him right now
 
 Oh I just jumped into the Fey King really
quick to see if anything was happening
 Lets lead them away from the pack
 I have not done that yet
 Point of clarification
 are we travelling
through worm tunnel at this point
 Okay Which is how wide again ten
 Ten feet across
 Ja thank you
 I dont think we need to pull up
the dome right now
 Is Nott out of our sight
 Playing the long game The long con
 Oh my god Long con
 
 Walking towards the noise ja
 The second one ran off down the hall a bit
 And simultaneously I am casting
Enlarge on Nott the Brave
 Show us a demonstration and we will
induct you to the Mighty Nein
 Leeches
 Come on
 No
 Damn it
 Yeah I have a question for you
my little friend Do you eat enough
under your current leadership
 We will keep your belly full If you travel
with us you will have never eaten so much
in your life But we do need a guide
down here and you could be that guide
the cage sling it over my hornets
tie them back to my staff
 Oh That is less appealing
 Not the bees Not the bees
 And in your  days what is the worst thing
you have ever seen down here
 Plus hes near the end of his life
We might as well show him great things
going to eat better than he ever has
We could let him look at the dodecahedron
 Or leave it in the bag Im just
kidding forget it Thats a bad idea
 Its funny but its not wise
 DD happiness and sadness tied together
 This is the best This is the best
 Its like a Dune suit man you cant let
that shit go to waste
 Reduce reuse recycle
 You said citadel We are seeing
a fortress down here
 Okay
 Caleb starts walking slowly back through the
entire walking formation
 That spurt was quick but potent
 Well fuck yall because I rolled a two
 Thats a four for me
 Theres a delayed reaction
out in the lobby
 Because hes so awesome
 Does Caduceus see that or everybody
 Have I ever read Ive read a lot
about fire giants under the earth Yes
 Ja my grandmother used to keep me up
late at night reading me stories about
things like this No I dont know anything
I dont know
 I know about the history of the country I
grew up in not about underground fortresses
 Lets put a pin in that and get back to it
 I was speaking in metaphor
 Perkins You are such a fun player Jeez
 Such a  from Shale when you were
here the last time
 Yeah Thats a dude double fisting full on
 Maybe they will go to sleep eventually
Maybe we can come back a little later
 Yeah if we are crazy enough to start
a fight with these two
 But if we do the bubble is a good idea
although I have to stay in the bubble
for the bubble to be in effect
 What about this What if Fjord does
that distraction we talked about across the fire
You Banished that stone creature I know
how to do that as well If you and I both
take a shot at the one on our side
one of us maybe will succeed
 And
 While they are all debating this I channel
a little bit of transmutive energy into my
stone and change its focus from constitution
to fire resistance for myself
 Not today I didnt study that last night
 Yeah its you two
You are the quickest
 A plan
 Im the odd man out
 No there are many things I could do
but I did not do my homework last night
that would facilitate those things
 Jester bring the haversack over open it up
so that Beauregard can focus on the mote of possibility
 Just look into the bag
Just like huffing gasoline
 Beauregards face goes into
another dimension for a moment
 Yes you keep all your thoughts
Look theres the creative lead
of Dungeons  Dragons over there
 You take all the stat adjustments except for
your brains in there so all your decision making
is the same But dexterity saves and stuff
thats the creatures stats right
 Just imagine if Jester had teleported away
 Beauregard is now Noahs ark
 Very heavy metal
 One 
 Theyre clanging
 Its probably ten or 
 Hey Ill do it Caleb leans out the
passageway and casts Polymorph on the giant
 It is  I believe
  wisdom
 Its a cow
 You call yourself a dungeon master Jesus
 Oh my god One Well wait no Theres
no natural ones in initiative Thats a three
 If anyone attacks the cow Im going to
beat you up in the lobby tonight Dont do it
  A cow killed my wife
 Yeah Its concentration
 Usain Bolt just comes 
 
 Princess Bride moment
 Holy shit
 Just powder
 Speed  feet is what the internet
is telling me
 Just let it happen Just let it happen
 Take  points of cow damage
 That just means youre going to Bilbo Baggins
your way across this bridge motherfucker
 Dont kill my goblin Matthew
 Ja Im going to lean out Im going
to extend my middle finger to the giant
on the bridge mutter a few arcane words
around my hand and cast Banishment
  charisma Components are an item
distasteful to the target
 So for my movement I am going to just
take a step not back in but to the side
 Actually and I will walk
To the other side of the dog
 Yeah right there
 Yeah And Im just looking for Nott
 Come on La Come on
 Fuck our culture
 Oh man
 This is what happened the last time
we went to the Underdark
 Its just where these people
live man
 But they are really gorgeous
to look at
 Yeah hats off Great books
 It took several days of Pike
giving me good mojo to heal
 Holy shite
 Dont you take my goblin mom away
 Its going to be around 
 Whats your full HP
 Oh shit Its got to be low then
to survive that
 So what I did last time did not work
so I am going to change tactics
and I am going to cast instead Polymorph
on the same giant
 Yeah
 A giant octopus
  wisdom
 He has a movement of ten
 Im going to move back into the
nope Im going to stay right there
 That was a lot
 Calebs standing like a doofus because he
didnt want to leave Nott so hes still out there
 Just make him mad
 To keep it occupied
 the octopus
is going nowhere
 Ooh meniscus tear
 Ten feet of movement
 What Okay
 I dont think so Its just that unless it
gets hit
 Lasts for the duration or until
the target drops to zero hit points
 For an action I will disengage and
juke leftright and run into the hole
